                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  Mr Speaker, I wish to draw attention to and raise a matter of privilege concerning the report of the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests that I have just presented. An article appeared on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> website yesterday evening, which contained details of the committee's report and its deliberations. It is clear that this article is the result of the unauthorised disclosure of information contained in the report and the committee's private deliberations. I present a copy of the article, by Paul Karp of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>, titled 'Rules that allowed Christian Porter to keep donors secret should be overhauled, committee finds.' This is a matter of considerable concern to me as chair of the committee. Members will be aware that, under the standing orders and the Parliamentary Privileges Act, unauthorised disclosure of committee documents and proceedings is prohibited and may amount to a contempt of the House where the disclosure causes or is likely to cause substantial interference with the work of the House or the committee system. In accordance with established practice, I intend for the committee to investigate this apparent breach in the first instance and report back to the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not the title but the task. It is not the office; it's the outcome. Clearly, the Privileges Committee's confidence has been surely offended. This is an important committee of the House where someone has decided to use the committee as a dirty rag and throw it in the bin. The article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> suggests the committee is partisan. It is not. There has never been a vote held in that committee under my stewardship. Any conversation around the timing and tabling of the report was my error—mine alone, no other's. The walls of the integrity, intention and spirit of the committee have been breached, and I take full responsibility for that breach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having regard to the integrity of the work of the committee and its important place in this House, I intend that on the first meeting in the next sitting—that is, the first sitting next year—I will tender my resignation as chair, allowing the Prime Minister of this nation to appoint a chair who will have the confidence of all the committee.</span>

I don't think it's a matter for him to fall on his sword over. I would say to him that I have been on this committee for many years over various iterations, going back some time and, I have to say, the committee under the stewardship of the member for Monash has operated in a completely bipartisan way, with cooperation from everyone on the committee, with great respect for the member for Monash's leadership. I have no idea what the explanation is as to why this matter was leaked to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>, but I concur with you, Member for Monash, on its inference around how the committee operates. I think it is appropriate that you raise it with the Speaker as a matter of privilege.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would ask you most sincerely to reconsider your decision to tender your resignation at the next sitting of the committee. I don't have my other committee comrades from this side of the House in the chamber, but I am certain that I'm speaking on their behalf as well as on behalf of your own party members who are on that committee. Please understand that there is great respect for you in your committee role. This committee, as you rightly pointed out, is a very important committee. It has dealt with a number of very serious allegations, the most recent of which you have tabled today. Those deliberations were held collegiately and were well informed with good advice. I ask you to reconsider your decision. Understand that you have the confidence of the committee.</span>

I speak as the Father of the House in this regard and as a long-term member of the Privileges Committee. What has happened is absolutely regrettable, but it's not the fault of the member for Monash. I would join with and concur with the member for Lingiari, and I am certain I speak for the other coalition members of the Privileges Committee—one of whom is here, the member for North Sydney—in saying that we support the chairmanship of this committee by the member for Monash. I, too, would ask him to reconsider. The member for Monash is one of the most honourable people who sit in this parliament; that is my long experience of him. I don't always agree with him, but I hold him in the utmost respect. His leadership of this committee as chair has been exemplary. As I said, what has regrettably leaked into the media is not his fault in any way. It should not be the burden of him leaving the position he has. He has the utmost respect of the members of the committee.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—The establishment of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission to provide centralised oversight of safeguarding for the NDIS was an important step towards improving safeguards and the quality of service provision for people with disability in Australia. This oversight is especially important for NDIS participants who may face increased risks of being subject to abuse, exploitation or neglect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee decided to conduct an inquiry into the commission after issues with the oversight and regulation of disability service providers, including by the commission, emerged in the light of the media attention and subsequent inquiries into the tragic death of Ms Ann-Marie Smith. The inquiry has identified areas in which the commission's approach to its work could be improved. In particular, the committee heard that the commission should be more proactive in its engagement with participants and the sector, and in its compliance and enforcement measures. In addition, gaps persist in safeguarding arrangements for NDIS participants and people with disability more broadly, particularly in the areas where NDIS services interface with services provided by state or territory governments or other areas of the federal system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report includes 30 recommendations in relation to these matters and other areas of the commission's work. As noted throughout the report, since the inquiry began in mid-2020, the commission has adopted a range of measures to improve its practice and processes. The committee welcomes these changes and was pleased to note the commission's willingness to listen to people with disability, their advocates and the sector, and to adapt processes in response over the course of the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is nonetheless clear that safeguarding gaps continue to exist for people with disability and that work by the commission and all Australian governments needs to continually identify safeguarding gaps and quickly address them. The review of the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Framework is crucial in this respect, and, in addition to its specific recommendations, the committee urges the government to carefully consider all the matters raised in this report in that review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn then to the <span style="font-style:italic;">General issues</span><span style="font-style:italic;">2021</span> report. The committee's inquiry into general issues related to the implementation and performance of the NDIS provides an ongoing opportunity for the public to present important evidence to the committee related to the NDIS, including its implementation, performance, governance, administration and expenditure. This is the committee's second report in the 46th Parliament for this inquiry. It examines new issues raised in evidence to the general issues inquiry, since the tabling of the first report in December 2020, and provides an update on the committee's recent activities. Chapter 5 of the report also contains the committee's interim report in relation to its inquiry into the current scheme implementation and forecasting for the NDIS and makes one recommendation in relation to that inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the committee thanks all those who contributed to the committee's inquiries by lodging submissions, providing additional information or expressing their views via correspondence. The committee would also like to thank those who gave their time to attend the committee's public hearings. In particular the committee acknowledges the people with disability, their families and carers who shared their experiences. The testimony of people with lived experience is crucial to identify issues with the NDIS and improve the operation of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all the members of the committee, the deputy chair, Senator Brown and the other members, and I thank the secretariat for their wonderful ongoing work in this regard.</span>

I congratulate and commend the work of the member for Menzies as the chair and Senator Carol Brown as the deputy chair, and I commend the reports. I also want to thank the secretariat for their conduct of both of these particular reports. These reports make a number of important recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to the first report on general issues tabled. The Morrison government has, I'm sorry to say, been undermining public confidence in the National Disability Insurance Scheme by talking down the sustainability of the scheme at every public occasion. I also think they have done a disservice to the 467,000 participants in the scheme by listing two, three or four matters where funding was granted in controversial circumstances. This has been about reducing the NDIS. In 2021—the Speaker might be interested to know—the Morrison government put out 10 conflicting sets of numbers about the financial health of the scheme to justify some of the changes which it's proposed bringing into the scheme. It's also underestimated and undermined the scheme by failing to look at the benefit of the $22 billion scheme. The National Disability Services, the peak body for employers in the disability services sector, did a report from an independent group of economists who revealed that the $22 billion scheme was injecting $52 billion into the Australian economy. So, for every dollar spent on the NDIS, it was generating $2.25 in economic activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think that this overreach and undermining of the scheme has been used to justify an extraordinary power grab which would see the Morrison government hand unprecedented God powers, if you like, to the unelected public servant heading the national disability agency to step into peoples' plans and change any matter. The government has described the NDIS as a welfare agency rather than the great, generous Australian safety net of universal support which it was originally intended to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also I need to report my concern that there's been an explosion of NDIS appeals against the Morrison government, as revealed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's annual report. The 2020-21 AAT annual report reveals that the NDIS division of the AAT has seen a 21 per cent increase in appeals lodged since the last financial year and a 77 per cent increase in the number of cases that were not finalised by the end of the financial year, with 1,631 outstanding decisions. The median time to finalise cases has now blown out by five weeks to 23 weeks. The explosion in appeals, I submit, has been driven by ordinary Australians having to resort to taking their own government to court in order to receive a universal safety net payment. It has become a battleground where the Morrison government turns up with all of its Goliath-like resources—the expensive private law firms—to fight Australians in their David-like struggle, where they have just themselves or advocates, if they can find the scarce advocate resources to do so. What shows that there is a deliberate strategy of undermining the NDIS by litigating until the participant or the person with a disability just gives up is that the percentage of cases brought to the AAT that are finalised in the AAT process without a decision is 98 per cent. So there is a lot of settling at the door of court by government lawyers once they realise the participant will not simply give up on their right to a modest level of support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government should explain the huge increase in appeals and the blowout in finalising cases. These are facts which cannot be spun away. It should explain itself to participants and parents like Liv and her mum, Gemma, who were forced to take the government to the AAT when Liv's funding was slashed. She was refused assistive technology which could assist her to walk. I do not make this up. The increase in AAT appeals is a symptom, I submit, of the Morrison government's increasing attempts to cut the scheme by stealth by refusing supports or slashing plans and defying the participant to fight on. The number of AAT cases as a proportion of NDIS participants more than doubled between June 2020 and September 2021. The government is doing everything in its power to discourage participants on the plans and to make changes to the plans of people with disabilities, forcing them to fight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the second report, the quality and safeguards report, we still need an independent inquiry into deaths of participants who were under the care of the NDIS, and we will continue to push for an independent inquiry. The government makes its point about pink batts and talks about people who died as the contractors were rolling out poor health and safety in that scheme, but it is unfortunately silent when we talk about participants of the NDIS who died while they were receiving NDIS packages or who had their NDIS packages terminated. Geoff Barker passed away on 2 May. His family had told the NDIA's arranged support worker that Geoff was in crisis and needed daily check-ups or he would die. Despite raising the alarm on 20 April this year—Geoff, who was 50 when he passed, had uncontrolled diabetes and experienced a severe bipolar condition—he was found unconscious by a carer on 2 May. The family notified the support coordinator on 20 April. He was found unconscious by a carer on 2 May. He hadn't been checked on for several days when he was found. His family have since discovered that the approved regular checks on Geoff and his partner, who also lives with a severe mental illness, were not being conducted. The family do not know how long he was unconscious before he was found. It is the latest in a series of tragedies in the NDIS caused by negligent stewardship of the scheme by the current government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia, Ann-Marie Smith died of severe neglect after being left in a cane chair for many months. She was left in the cane chair where she was toileted and fed and slept. In New South Wales, David Harris was found deaths months after he had died, after the NDIS cut off his supports because he hadn't attended a planning meeting. In Tasmania, Tim Rubenach, who passed in 2018, died in severe pain while waiting for the NDIS to send him a new bed and chair. In Queensland, Liam Daniher died earlier this year after months of fighting the NDIS for a seizure mat to help his epileptic condition that his family say would have saved his life.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report makes 30 recommendations in respect of safeguarding people with disabilities in the NDIS. But where you have not one, not two, but at least five tragedies, surely this would prompt the government to do an independent investigation. How many people have to die on the NDIS before the government thinks this is more than just another day at the office? We should look at this report on the Quality and Safeguards Commission and it should be acted upon. As we break for the summer, if Minister Reynolds does not take heed of these clearly articulated solutions to a glaringly obvious, well-documented and well-known problem—a problem, though, which has lives at risk—people with disabilities are disproportionately unsafe under the Morrison government's toothless watchdog and ineffectual safeguarding system.</span>

In a similar vein, the government's record on protecting people with disabilities during COVID has been disappointing to say the least. They were promised to be at the front of the queue with the rollout of the vaccinations—and we find out in a Senate hearing that the government had reprioritised people with disability down the queue—</span>

                    </a>  The Minister for Health finds the truth of the neglect of this government on the NDIS uncomfortable and he seeks to shut me down. You can try to shut me down but the voters will have their say on your poor stewardship. The federal government has a responsibility to show leadership. The minister says it is unfair of me to raise these issues. I bet you haven't even read the member for Menzies' report, which talks about 30 recommendations. Which one do you agree with? Which one don't you agree with? Indeed, have you even read it? But that doesn't stop you from lambasting me. The government looks forward to the 'prompt response'. You've had eight years, government. I look forward to your 'prompt response'. The minister's very good at laying the blame at Labor's feet for mistakes made under previous administrations, but he doesn't have a mirror in his own policy house to examine their own failings.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are too many heart-rending stories. The people whose names I read out are real people with real families. There is too much victim-blaming. There is too much quiet whispering in the corridors of the gallery, where they say to the journalists that the scheme is too expensive, that the housing packages are too expensive, that too many people with autism are getting funding and that the safeguards commission is not functioning as it should. This is the report. There are too many stories of misery inflicted on people the scheme was meant to help. The first step of comeback, of build back, for the NDIS has to be honouring the scheme's original intent. I hope the reforms being made which are proposed in the member for Menzies's report are not in another report to gather dust on the desk of this work-shy government. This government's stewardship of and record on the NDIS and its care for the vulnerable, tragically, leaves a lot to be desired and, in the case of some people, is just too late.</span>

The amendments in the National Health Amendment (Enhancing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2021 will support patient access to medicines and reflect new long-term five-year agreements with Medicines Australia and the Generic Biosimilar Medicines Association, GBMA, that collectively represent the medicines industry in Australia. These agreements build upon the longstanding partnership the government has fostered with Australia's medicines industry with the shared goal of supporting Australian patients.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new five-year strategic agreements with Medicines Australia and GBMA will (1) ensure that Australians continue to gain access to new breakthrough medicines and treatments as early as possible (2) deliver robust and uninterrupted supply of the medicines that Australians need and use every day and (3) keep the PBS on a long-term sustainable footing for patients, the industry and taxpayers. Specifically, the measures in this bill, which are part of a comprehensive package of reforms and improvements to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-developed with the medicines industry, will deliver (1) an improved statutory price framework which will support the ongoing investment in new PBS medicines and (2) a new medicines supply security guarantee, which will deliver greater levels of stock of commonly prescribed, older and very low cost PBS medicines, which, in recent years, have become susceptible to global medicine shortages. As part of this, there will be four to six months mandatory stockholding requirements for the relevant medicines, which will provide more reliable supply of medicines for many conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, epilepsy and mental health conditions such as depression.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge representations from some of the pharmaceutical companies in relation to proposed section 99ACN of the bill, which gives effect to some of the statutory price reductions agreed with the sector. The intention of section 99ACN is to apply a one-off statutory price reduction on 1 April 2023 to brands of pharmaceutical items that include drugs that have been listed on the PBS for 15 years or more and have not taken a price disclosure reduction. Whilst these provisions are intended to ensure judicious use of taxpayer money for the subsidy of medicines, importantly, as is the case now, and consistent with the broader intent of the bill, the prices of important PBS listed medicines will not be allowed to be reduced below that which is needed to secure supply for Australian patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides for several safeguards, including the continuation of ministerial discretion for statutory price reductions to not apply, as well as the introduction of new price protections and floor prices. I thank in particular the opposition and the shadow minister for health for their assistance in and support of these provisions. I undertake that there will be careful consideration during the life of this parliament for any issues that arise under that discretion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its initial introduction in 2018, ministerial discretion has been an effective and reliable mechanism for preventing statutory price reductions where they would not be appropriate. The bill therefore provides for the continuation of these powers for all statutory price reductions under the act where necessary to ensure that statutory price reductions do not jeopardise the supply of important medicines. The Australian government appreciates the importance of these protections for the pharmaceutical industry and for patients that rely on their medicines. This has been conveyed to government during the parliamentary engagement process over recent weeks and during consultation with the sector. Accordingly, my department is commencing consultation with Medicines Australia, the GBMA and other companies on the consequential amendments and updates to ministerial discretion guidance material that will arise from this bill and will inform the application process going forward. Should a company believe that a statutory price reduction under the act would result in an adverse outcome for patients, they will have the opportunity to request ministerial discretion prior to any reduction occurring. It is important to note that forecast price reductions to specific medicines anticipated from 1 April 2023 will be published well in advance of that date to ensure predictability for companies, patients and the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislative elements of these landmark agreements are in addition to the significant policy and process reforms committed to in the strategic agreements with MA and GBMA that will benefit Australian patients and taxpayers and advance the interests of the medicines industry. These include: at least $5 billion of uncapped new investment in PBS medicines listed over the life of the agreement, which consists of the PBS new medicines funding guarantee and the reinvestment of the efficiencies agreed with the sector and enacted through this bill; the co-design and implementation of an enhanced consumer engagement process to better capture the patient voice early in the medicines assessment process; ongoing and timely access to medicines through a review of Australia's health technology, assessment, policy and methods to support continuous improvement; a horizon-scanning forum to ensure Australians have early access to breakthrough treatments; and commitments to policy stability and predictability for the industry and for government. These landmark agreements build on the government's strong record on the PBS, which is demonstrated through the Seventh Community Pharmacy Agreement between the Australian government, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, signed in June of 2020; and improvements to the pharmaceutical wholesaler arrangements designed with the National Pharmaceutical Services Association and established through the seventh CPA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the amendments in the bill will deliver improvements to the operation of the PBS for the benefit of patients, taxpayers and the medicines industry. I would like to thank the negotiating team from Medicines Australia, GBMA and my department, who have demonstrated incredible commitment to achieving this outcome in the interests of patients and taxpayers. Penny, Adriana, Nikolai, Dan, and Sam Develin from my office have all worked tirelessly, along with the teams from MA and GBMA. All have operated in good faith. In particular, I would like to thank Anna Lavelle, Liz de Somer, Neil MacGregor, Liz Chapman and Bruce Goodwin from MA; and Jane Halton, Marnie Peterson, Dennis Bastas from the Generic Biosimilar Medicines Association for their hard work, creativity and ingenuity that have attributed to the new strategic agreement and the innovative reforms in this bill. As I mentioned, Penny Shakespeare, Adriana Platona, Nikolai Tsyganov, Daniel Chaston and Andrew Whiteshead from the Department of Health; and Sam Devlin from my office and Stacey Edmondson and Nicole Green have all contributed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I do want to note and thank all speakers who have been part of this. I note <span style="font-style:italic;">The new frontier</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">delivering better health for all Australians</span> report from the inquiry into approval processes for new drugs and novel medical technologies in Australia from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport. This is an important initiative. We will consider it and we will look forward to responding as constructively as possible to as many of the recommendations as possible. It's about giving better access to new medicines as early as possible. It's about ensuring the continued strengthening of the medicines and device technology sectors in Australia and the clinical trials sector in Australia. It's an important reference. We thank the opposition and the crossbench for their proposed amendments. We respectfully will not be adopting either of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note on a very positive front that on the weekend I was pleased to be joined by Sharn Coombes, our candidate for the seat of Dunkley, for the listing of another new medicine: Venetoclax, which will be available tomorrow for over 340 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Venetoclax is an important and significant addition, to ensure that patients who suffer from acute myeloid leukaemia will have access to a medicine which would otherwise cost $88,000 and which now will be available for as little as $41.30 per script, or $6.60 per script for concessional patients. That's what the PBS is about. That's what this bill is about—making as many medicines available as early as possible to as many patients as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, since October 2013, on precisely that front, over 2,800 new or amended medicine listings have been made on the PBS from an overall investment of $14 billion. The government has a policy to list all new medicines recommended for listing by the experts on the PBAC, and this bill will ensure that this can continue to occur long into the future. I thank the members for their contributions to debate on this bill. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These two additional parts of the amendment to the National Health Act are most important. We have two provisions in the act about the provision of vaccines, but neither of them have any requirement that the administration of those vaccines be only done with free and informed consent. This is a fundamental tenet of medical ethics that has developed over the centuries, and it should be in our National Health Act to spell it out loudly and clearly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason this amendment is needed is that it's very clear when it comes to free consent that we have medical treatments being administered in this nation today that are not given with free consent. And we see it in thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs and occupations, from airline pilots to nurses to schoolteachers to people that work at Woolworths. They are facing not only a loss of their job unless they submit to take one of the COVID vaccines; in many cases, they are facing the loss of their career. They are being prohibited to work in their career of choice. When someone has a mortgage to pay, when someone has rent to pay, when someone has children that they need to look after, they have no option; it is coercion and threats that they are actually taking these COVID vaccines under. That is not free consent. We have a society at the moment where you cannot cross a state border unless you have been vaccinated. In Sydney today, I cannot sit in a barber's chair and get a haircut; I cannot sit in a barber's chair in Queanbeyan, but, if I come across the border to Canberra, I can get a haircut. In Sydney today, inside, I cannot sing, I cannot dance, because I'm unvaccinated. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an absurdity. We are abandoning those principles of medical ethics that have stood us in good stead and have been developed over the centuries. Those two provisions need to be put in to ensure that we are getting free consent. Because it's free and informed—that's the phrase. There is also no informed consent. How can we have informed consent in this nation when we have doctors that are censored and silenced and face threat of deregistration if they decide to put up an alternative expert medical opinion? </span>

                    </a>  Doctors must be free to give their own opinion to their patients. The sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship is important, and we cannot have informed consent in this nation if our doctors are silenced, censored and face threat of deregistration, because that is exactly what is happening. There cannot be informed consent when other medical experts from around the world, such as Dr Peter McCullough—probably one of the most highly qualified medical minds in all of the United States of America—says, in his belief, that the vaccines are not sufficiently effective and they are not sufficiently safe and should be stopped tomorrow, but his opinion is not allowed on any mainstream media. His opinion is censored from places like Facebook and Twitter. How can there be informed consent if there is a suppression of free speech? And how can there be informed consent when we continue to say 'safe and effective' but yet there is zero—I repeat zero—long-term safety data? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the short-term safety data, the method of data collection is not fit for purpose. It is grossly underreporting the number of adverse events. I'll give an example of this. We have the TGA collecting data for adverse events, and they currently say the number of adverse events from the COVID vaccines is 0.21 per cent. The question is: how many are being underreported? The TGA say: very little. However, we have another group that reports on vaccine safety, called AusVaxSafety. What do AusVaxSafety do? They actually contact, rather than wait for a voluntary response. They are sending SMS messages out to people after they have the COVID vaccine. They have got over four million responses back, and those responses show that the number of people going to a hospital or emergency department or doctor's surgery—which, according to the TGA, should all be reported, under the method they use—is running at 0.9 per cent. So the TGA data is 0.21 per cent, and the AusVaxSafety data is 0.9 per cent—and we know the AusVaxSafety data is underreported because it only goes out on the third day. From that, we know that the TGA's data of adverse events is missing at least 75 per cent of adverse events occurring. Yet that is not reported.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can there be informed consent? Are parents aware that when their child, a 12- to 17-year-old child, goes and gets a vaccine, their child, if they are in the United States of America, would not be getting the Moderna vaccine because the Food and Drug Administration in the US has not yet decided that it is safe for injection in a 12-year-old child? Do Australian parents understand, and are they given the information, that the Moderna vaccine being injected into their 12-year-old child has been suspended as an injection for 12-year-old children in places like Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and many other countries? Is that information being given to parents? Do parents know the data from AusVaxSafety about young adolescents, which shows that, in comparison to the Pfizer vaccine, while the Pfizer vaccine in adolescents reports at least one adverse event in 48 per cent of kids after the second dose the Moderna vaccine reports adverse events in an incredible 61 per cent? Are parents informed that, of the Pfizer vaccine in adolescents, just over one in 100 people report going to the emergency department and seeing a doctor after their second dose of Pfizer but just under two in 100 do if they are given a dose of Moderna? For adolescents, the chances of ending up needing to see a doctor or going to hospital increase by almost 100 per cent if they take the Moderna vaccine over the Pfizer vaccine. Are parents being informed of that? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this needed? We have had this advisory committee on medicines deciding they would ban ivermectin in this country. ho reviews this decision? Who questions them? We have experts in this country—men like Professor Thomas Borody, with more letters after his name than the alphabet, and Emeritus Professor Robert Clancy—who not only have been using these treatments on Australians but have documented and shown that they are saving lives. They have documented and shown that they are keeping Australians out of hospital. Yet an unelected group of unaccountable faceless bureaucrats, many of them not even medical people, have come forward and told those two medical geniuses, who are among the highest qualified people in this country, that they cannot use a treatment that they have demonstrated will save lives. There clearly needs to be more oversight of these groups because they are not doing their job as the Australian public would want them to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other amendment is to section 132, which relates to the provision of COVID vaccines and treatments. It calls for the minister, before engaging in any conduct that would restrict any medical practitioners, such as Professor Borody and the 30 doctors he had working underneath him, to engage in some consultation. Has the minister sat down with Professor Borody to go through the results of his trials? There have been 600 patients and zero deaths. We know that in an equivalent group of 600 Australians who had COVID there would normally be seven deaths. There should be in the legislation a requirement for the minister and the department to consult with these medical doctors, who are saving lives, before they pull the rug from underneath them.</span>

They enhance the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to talk simply about more oversight and more consultation and to make sure that the concepts of free and informed choice and consent are enshrined in law. I would hope that every single member of this House supports the amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I say that Labor is on the side of Australian veterans and their families. We will be supporting the legislation, as it will simplify and streamline assistance to veterans and improve their wellbeing. The bill addresses recommendations made by Mr David Tune in his 2019 Independent Review of the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Payment—the Tune review as it's now known—and the Productivity Commission's 2019 report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">A better way to support veterans</span>. I note that the Morrison government first announced these measures in the 2020-21 budget, and it announced its intention to bring forward these important changes from 20 September to 1 January 2022 in this year's budget following pressure from Labor and the TPI veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms will simplify the administration of some payments for veterans and their dependants. This will be done by exempting disability payments from income testing under the Social Security Act 1991, simplifying payment arrangements for approximately 14,000 veterans and their dependants. The government will also increase access to rent assistance for most of our veterans with disabilities. This will benefit approximately 6,900 veterans and their dependants. Specifically, the first schedule will implement the government's commitment to exempt the adjusted disability pension defined in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 from the income test under the Social Security Act. This will remove the need for the Defence Force income support allowance, known as DFISA. Introduced in 2004, DFISA was paid as a top-up to ensure that veterans who received an age pension under the Social Security Act were not financially disadvantaged. Changes in this schedule will ensure that veterans will receive the same payment as before, but the administrative process will be much simpler.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second schedule will remove the disability income rent test from the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This will mean that veterans with disabilities will now have access to the same rent assistance as those who receive it from Centrelink. It will increase rent assistance payable to veterans or enable some veterans with disabilities to receive rent assistance for the very first time. The disability income rent test results in severely disabled veterans receiving less rent assistance than those with a lower level of disability. In particular, this measure will benefit totally and permanently incapacitated veterans who presently do not receive any rent assistance due to the amount of compensation they receive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third schedule will remove reference to the term 'disability pension' in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. In future, this payment will be referred to as the 'disability compensation payment'. This change will clarify that these payments are compensation and will reduce the potential for the payment to be confused with the Department of Social Services disability support pensions. The measures contained in these first three schedules will commence on 1 January next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill's fourth schedule will streamline indexation of disability pension compensation. Currently, the extreme disablement adjustment intermediate rate and special rates pension, colloquially known as the TPI payment, is split into two components for indexation purposes. Each is indexed separately. The fourth schedule will remove this anomaly so that the whole amount is indexed as one. This measure will commence on 20 September 2022. This will simplify the Department of Veterans' Affairs legislation, policy and procedures. It will also help avoid confusion for veterans about the purpose and structure of the extreme disablement adjustment intermediate and special rates of disability pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth schedule in the bill introduces a pilot program for earlier access to rehabilitation. Labor supports this legislation, as it will improve and streamline assistance to veterans and improve their wellbeing. While those measures that I've just referred to in this bill are beneficial, we know it's actually not what most TPI veterans want. The reality is that most actually want an increase in the TPI payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I moved a second reading amendment on behalf of my colleague Shayne Neumann, who is in a position to speak to this bill but not in a position to procedurally move an amendment to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of Labor and, indeed, my shadow ministerial colleague, we moved that amendment because we are concerned that the commitments that were made, the undertakings that were given by the Prime Minister to this very important constituency, have gone without proper realisation of what was undertaken by the government. There was a very, very strong impression left on veterans and their families that this government, prior to the last election, was making an undertaking to increase the TPI payment, but we've seen no such increase to that payment. For that reason, the government should hang their heads in shame because that was the impression that the Prime Minister left them—that they would be providing an increase to the TPI payment—and that's not forthcoming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst of course we support the provisions because they will provide some support to some veterans with disabilities, particularly in relation to rent support, we believe they are too little. More should be done to provide support to this very important constituency, who have been advocating now for years to see increases to their TPI payment. While measures in this bill, as I say, are beneficial, we know it wasn't what they actually expected or wanted. I am moving this second reading amendment to call out the Morrison-Joyce government for its appalling treatment of Australia's 27,000 TPI veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex Servicemen and Women, known as the TPI Federation, has raised the issue of the TPI payment for several years now, but the government has ignored their concerns. This is why Labor referred the issue of the adequacy of the TPI payment to a Senate inquiry earlier this year: so that TPI veterans could have their say. The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee inquiry into the TPI payment reported on 1 July this year and recommended that the government consider an increase in the payment. At the time, Labor called on the government to respond to the committee's unanimous recommendation, which would ensure that those veterans who have severe disabilities, in particular, would not be left behind. However, in its response to the inquiry tabled on 7 October, all the Morrison government could say was that it notes the recommendation and will take it into account when considering future policy options for support to TPI veterans. This was a grave disappointment to TPI veterans and their families, and it underlines that this government does like to make announcements and does like to give the impression of providing support to particular constituencies in the country, but doesn't follow through and doesn't always deliver, despite its undertakings earlier. It was just another blow for these long-suffering ex-service men and women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, before the 2019 election the Prime Minister raised the hopes of the TPI Federation that he would increase the payment by commissioning the review, only to dash them after the election with his flawed response to the review. After sitting on the report for more than a year, the Prime Minister announced in last year's delayed October budget that he'd provide only rent assistance to a small proportion of TPI veterans—about 10 per cent of all TPI veterans—leaving most very dismayed that they will miss out. In response to Labor's questions in Senate estimates last year, it was revealed these benefits would not start to flow until September next year, while the government made changes to legislation and IT systems. Following pressure from Labor and the TPI veterans, the government did bring forward the measures in this bill to January next year, but given that they have left it to the very last sitting week this year to introduce and pass legislation it's probably fair to say that they're cutting it very fine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that this is now time critical, Labor will not stand in the way of these measures and want to see some assistance, however modest, for these most deserving former Defence personnel. We do censure the government for ignoring the recommendation of the Senate inquiry to boost the TPI payment and for its appalling treatment of TPI veterans over eight long years. The Prime Minister should listen to his colleagues, including Senator and former Major General Jim Molan, who said that this is the most deserving issue in the veteran community. I don't always agree with Senator Molan, but the fact is he is absolutely right when he says that this is one of the most deserving issues for the veterans community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, we know that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is struggling to deal with a huge backlog of veterans with disability pension claims, with 68 per cent of claims yet to be finalised as of April this year. This, along with long waiting times for most veterans' claims, has prompted the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Defence Personnel to commission a fresh review of the DVA claims processing system by one of the government's favoured consultants, McKinsey. Meanwhile the government refuses to address the real reason behind these dangerously long delays with assistance, which are having a terrible impact on veterans' mental health—that is, chronic staff shortages and record levels of labour hire workers, many of whom are not skilled to deal with this constituency, with the people who are in need of help. We say to the government that they need to do better in providing proper support and advice to the veteran community. It is just not good enough. Our veterans and their families deserve so much better. Notwithstanding this, the bill currently before the House is better than nothing. It will go some way towards supporting some veterans with disabilities and their families and former Defence personnel more broadly. To that extent, Labor supports this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  At the outset, I acknowledge that the member for Herbert is in the chamber. I recognise his fine service in uniform and, indeed, his ongoing contribution to veterans' affairs and to his community at large since he resumed life as a civilian. I also acknowledge that today in Brisbane the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide continues and that senior counsel assisting, Kevin Connor SC, has said inquiry hearings will be held in regional centres such as Townsville, so proudly represented by the member for Herbert, as well as Wagga Wagga, my hometown, a city with tri-service representation—the Royal Australian Air Force at Forest Hill, the Royal Australian Navy at the RAAF base, and Kapooka, the home of the soldier, from which a long line of khaki stretching back to Gallipoli, and even before that, has marched out. Indeed, just the other day, Governor-General David Hurley was the reviewing officer at the latest march-out, where 60 or so recruits joined the 350,000 before them who now and in the past have proudly worn the khaki uniform. We say thanks to them. Thanks to you for your service. Thanks to you for your sacrifice. May that long continue and endure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened carefully to the member for Gorton and I heard what he had to say about the total and permanently incapacitated payments. I would say to any veterans listening: don't just listen to what Labor says; observe carefully what Labor does. I well recall when I first served in this place what Labor did in the Defence space and what Labor didn't do in the veteran space. I'm proud to be part of a government which has provided record investment to Defence and very much listened to the needs and wants of our veteran community. As a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I'm very much in tune with what veterans have to say. I know that many veterans not only do their recruit training through Wagga Wagga and end up being posted to Wagga Wagga; they also return to Wagga Wagga and the Riverina once their military careers are over. In terms of requiring help, if any veteran is seeking to reach out to say that they are not okay—and it is alright to say that you're not okay whether you're in uniform or part of the wider civilian network here in Australia—they can call Open Arms, a 24-hour line, on 1800011046 or the Department of Defence All-hours Support Line on 1800628036.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased when I was the veterans' affairs minister that the Defence-centric or veteran-centric reform legislation was put to the parliament. That piece of legislation was very important for the current and future needs of those who wear and have worn our uniforms. Indeed, at 30 June 2019, the Australian Defence Force comprised about 58,000 permanent members—47,000 men and 11,000 women—and 27,500 active reserve personnel across the RAN, the Army and the RAAF. At June 2019 there were more than 290,000 DVA beneficiaries in receipt of pensions, allowances and treatment or pharmaceuticals. This included about 184,000 veterans and 110,000 dependants.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Exempting Disability Payments from Income Testing and Other Measures) Bill 2021 is an important piece of legislation. This bill assists in ensuring some of our most vulnerable veterans will be better assisted, better supported and helped at the point when they require that assistance. We are giving them exactly what they need. It delivers on the government's budget commitments announced in October 2020 and May 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I noted that the member for Gorton talked about the delayed budget and the favoured consultants, dripping with sarcasm. This isn't about having a crack at the government. This should be about doing what we need to do in a bipartisan way for our veterans. I'm pleased that Labor will not stand in the way of this bill passing the House of Representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements the recommendations of the review conducted by esteemed public servant David Tune into the adequacy of the TPI payments. This bill includes provisions to exempt disability pensioners' income under the Social Security Act. These alterations simplify the support system for more than 14,000 veterans and dependants and negate the need for the Defence Force income support supplement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are provisions to remove a means test imposed on rent assistance for certain veterans and dependants. About 6,900 veterans and dependants will now become eligible for rent assistance or an increased rate of rent assistance. This ensures assistance even under the provisions of acts that are passed and changes that are ultimately made as time goes on. Even if a veteran drops, say, $100 that they can't make up on, that, for many veterans, means the difference between having a reasonable life and being on the breadline. It truly does. That is why we know that the veterans' affairs legislation amendment is so critical and so time-sensitive as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes provisions to clarify the existing disability pension. It's a compensation payment but it should not be confused with other income support measures such as Centrelink's disability support pension. It also provides for the simplification of indexation arrangements for the disability pension, which is presently an overly complicated bureaucratic process. If there is one thing I know and that veterans certainly know it's that they don't want a complicated, intricate, bureaucratic process. They want to know that they are going to be supported without having to go through all sorts of rigmarole and hardship just to get the payments that they so desperately want, need, expect and, most importantly, deserve—because it's their money. They have been sent, by us, by the government, by the Commonwealth, to do a job. They have done that job proudly. They have done that job diligently. They have sacrificed so much. That's why it's so important that this pass the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also includes a measure to implement a two-year trial of non-liability rehabilitation. This will enable veterans participating in the trial to access DVA rehabilitation services in a more prompt manner, without the need to make a claim for compensation or to have to wait for the determination of liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has accepted all of the recommendations of the review undertaken by Mr Tune. If passed, this bill will give effect to changes to meet four of these recommendations. The Defence Force Income Support Allowance will be abolished; and the adjusted disability pension, including the TPI payment and permanent impairment payment, under the MRCA, will be defined as exempt income under the social security law. That is schedule 1. In schedule 2, in addition, the disability income rent test should be abolished. This would simplify payment arrangements and allow TPI veterans who are renting to receive Commonwealth rent assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also gives effect to changes that include the indexation of the TPI payment being changed to index the whole payment all at once rather than in two components. That's schedule 4. This could also apply to the intermediate and extreme disablement adjustment rates of disability pensions. The split indexation mechanism was brought in in 2004 as a result of the different indexation mechanisms in place for the general rate and above general rate components, but it is now redundant as the indexation mechanisms were all brought into line back in 2008.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also changes the terminology and language in legislation guidelines and policy documents. This will mean that the TPI pension will no longer be referred to as a pension but as a payment. Some stakeholders are concerned that the term 'pension' in schedule 3 implies welfare instead of compensation. It's not welfare; it is indeed compensation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The feedback received by the government when these measures were introduced and announced in the October 2020 budget was that the measures were supported. The proposed legislation before the House today is critical because veterans know how important this is. They know how important every dollar in their account is—it's deserved and needed. We've listened to that feedback, of course. We've brought the implementation forward to 1 January 2022 as part of this year's budget which was handed down in May.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans will not need to apply for rent assistance. DVA will contact those income support recipients who may be eligible, and we will seek up-to-date rent information from them. Once received, this information will be used to undertake the assessment process of rent assistance, with payments commencing on the first pay day following New Year's Day next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on the Senate inquiry recommendation that the government consider increasing the TPI payment, I appreciate what the member for Gorton says. We are constantly in a process of consultation with veterans. We will continue to be the side of politics that listens to veterans and acts on their concerns. We understand full well the service and sacrifice that they have made, both at home and abroad. We will continue to take on board those discussions and that feedback, and that is why we are bringing forward this particular legislation and those particular payments as part of this legislation. We know that it is needed, we know that it is expected and we know that it is deserved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To veterans: please know that help is always at hand, whether in mental health support or in financial support, because you deserve it and because you have sacrificed so much for and on behalf of our nation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  [by video link] I'm pleased to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Exempting Disability Payments from Income Testing and Other Measures) Bill 2021. I speak in support of the amendments moved by the member for Gorton. This government has ignored the concerns of 27,000 TPI veterans. The government has ignored the recommendations of a vital Senate committee, which recommended an increase in the TPI payment. This bill is better than nothing. As the member for Gordon has indicated in his speech, there are 6,900 veterans and independents who will benefit from this bill, so Labor won't stand in the way of them receiving some additional assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill removes the disability income rent test under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. It's one of three acts that apply in the area of veterans' affairs: MRCA, DRCA and VEA, and VEA applies to TPI recipients. This change will operate from 1 January 2022, so the government's left it very late to assist a small cohort of veterans who need help. These are veterans on low incomes in private rental accommodation who would be eligible for Commonwealth Rental Assistance, who'd receive a high rate of rent assistance, and they'll get a bit of help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also exempts their disability pension from social security income tests from 1 January 2022, which means that what is commonly called the DFISA, a top-up payment, will be abolished as it's simply not necessary. There's some renaming of the disability pension to the disability compensation payment to clarify that the disability pension is not an income support pension or welfare but a compensation payment. There's an adjustment in terms of combining some separate indexation components and also the establishment of that two-year non-liability rehabilitation pilot program in response to the Productivity Commission review recommendation in relation to cultural change and encouraging early voluntary participation in rehabilitation. I might add that the government's not responded to even half of the Productivity Commission's recommendations in the report that was released on 2 July 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government advises that the changes to the bill are beneficial and no veterans receiving disability compensation claims will be worse off. I note that the government first announced these changes in the October 2020 budget. Perhaps the government should consider backdating the measure to provide rent assistance to some TPI veterans to October 2020, when the government accepted the recommendations of the Tune review. After all, the government knew it was underpaying TPI veterans, but it's not prepared to compensate them for the long time it took for this legislation to be drafted and eventually passed. It must be said that Labor is supporting this bill because, frankly, it's better than nothing. It's better than anything the government's delivered for disabled veterans to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't let this legislation go through without mentioning the government's abysmal treatment of TPI veterans over the last eight years. This is what our second reading amendment is all about. The fact is that the TPI Federation has been raising the issue of a TPI payment for several years, and the government's ignored their concerns. They've been the victims of grossly bad acts of faith on behalf of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the 2019 federal election, Prime Minister Scott Morrison effectively promised to increase the payment by announcing a review of the TPI pension to be conducted by Mr David Tune, and that would report after the election. The TPI review was really a cynical marketing exercise by a prime minister desperate to win an election, to placate veterans and to ask for their votes before the election. It was a pretend move. In a letter to the TPI Federation in April 2019, on the eve of the 2019 election, the Prime Minister committed the government to the review. He stated in that letter: 'The TPI Federation makes a compelling case in relation to the relative value of the above general rate component of the special rate of disability pension. The fact that TPI veterans are not able to earn an income as a result of their service to our nation means their loss of income during what would have been their working life should be appropriately recognised and replaced.' The Prime Minister said TPI veterans have a 'compelling case'. If ever there was a case of raising expectations, this is it. In fact, in a Senate estimates hearing in October last year, the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Liz Cosson, conceded that the Prime Minister's letter had raised expectations that the government would increase the TPI payment and the TPI Federation had made a strong argument for an increase. Ms Cosson admitted that she thought the TPI Federation had made a strong argument for an increase in the TPI pension, but this is not what the government's doing and it's not what this legislation does today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the election, the TPI Federation revealed there was very limited consultation with TPI veterans as a result of the review undertaken by David Tune. Mr Tune met with the TPI Federation only once so they could put their case to him. However, shockingly, the review completely dismisses the group's submissions. They were not even given a copy of the report. The review was then completed in August 2019 but was buried under the cloak of cabinet in confidence until the delayed October 2020 budget. Then, after sitting on the report for more than a year, the government finally announced the response in the budget. Far from increasing the TPI payment, all the government offered was some modest rent assistance to about 10 per cent of TPI veterans. That's what they said at the time: about 2,700 people living in private rental accommodation, leaving most TPI veterans disgusted that they were missing out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After raising the TPI Federation's hopes before the election, the government went on to dash them after the election. This was a huge disappointment to TPI veterans and shows that veterans who are TPI and other veterans can't trust the Prime Minister or this government. To add insult to injury, in response to Labor's questions in Senate estimates last year it was revealed that these benefits were not due to start flowing until September 2022 while the government made changes to legislation and IT systems. In other words, it would have been many years before even these people, who are acknowledged by the Tune review as being in desperate need of support, would receive any assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When asked by Labor in the hearing what these people should do in the meantime, DVA secretary Liz Cosson said, 'Good question.' It was only after pressure from Labor and TPI veterans that the government brought forward the start date to January 2022. They left it until the very last sitting of this year, 2021, to pass the enabling legislation. They were in very real danger of running out of time to deliver the budget measure from October 2020. It goes to show this government's priorities and the lack of urgency concerning support for TPI veterans. Given TPI pensioners have had to wait for answers since April 2019, when the Prime Minister commissioned the review on the eve of the election, these delays only created more anxiety and frustration amongst TPI veteran communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why Labor listened to TPI veterans and referred the matter to an independent Senate inquiry earlier this year so that TPI veterans could have their say. The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry was established by Labor on 18 March 2021 to examine the adequacy of the TPI payment special rate of disability pension and the case for an increase in the payment. The committee included government and Labor senators as well as independent Senator Jacqui Lambie and allowed for an open and transparent examination of the issues and establishment of the facts. The report was adopted unanimously, though I must say the government members played little role in the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this deliberation, the inquiry noted that a number of reviews of TPI payments in recent years, including the Tune review, concluded an increase in TPI payment was not warranted and recommended more targeted assistance instead. However—and this is really critical—the inquiry recognised that these reviews wrongly factored in other benefits, such as service pension and other payments, when considering the adequacy of support provided to TPI pensioners. The committee found that submitters made a persuasive case for a fair and just structural adjustment of the above general rate component of the TPI payment to restore the relative value of the payment and recognise and replace TPI veterans' loss of income. Further, in evidence before the committee DVA officials did not even attempt to defend the government's position and response to the Tune review. DVA officials agreed that the level of compensation for TPI veterans was inadequate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Based on all these submissions and evidence provided at the public hearings, the committee recommended that the government consider an increase in the TPI payment and consider the next exact level of the increase, yet the government has failed to do so. Labor welcomes the report. We have called on the government to do better and more. The government has failed to respond to the unanimous recommendation in a way that satisfies TPI veterans. The government has given platitudes in relation to the issue. There's an election coming up. There's a budget in March next year. If the government wants to take action, as it should, it should listen to the voices of TPI pensioners and give them the increase they need and deserve. As this amendment sets out, Labor condemns the government for its failure to accept the recommendations of the Senate inquiry and to listen to the voices, the cries and the pleas of TPI veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Labor opposition, I call on the government to do the right thing. We'll support this legislation today, but—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Samsoor contacted my office in February this year seeking assistance with a partnership visa application for his wife, Lida, to travel from Afghanistan to Australia. Lida's application had been pending for three years and, with the situation in Afghanistan deteriorating, Samsoor and Lida were pleading for action. Yet with my urgent letters to the Morrison government having gone unanswered for months, Samsoor and I were confronted with the sad fact that this government did not care about him and his family. When Lida finally received a humanitarian visa, on 23 August, about a week after the Taliban took over Kabul, she was turned away at the airport due to a communication breakdown between the Australian agencies. The Morrison government's negligence in failing to process visa applications for three years almost cost Lida her life, with two suicide bombers and multiple gunmen attacking crowds at Kabul airport shortly after Australian authorities turned her away into the chaos, clutching her humanitarian visa and her documents.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a terrifying three months trapped in Kabul, and despite the Morrison government's disgraceful mismanagement of the Afghanistan crisis, Lida has since made it to Australia. Samsoor and Lida are thrilled to be reunited, and I welcome Lida to Australia with open arms. I look forward to meeting her when she arrives in her new home in WA. I thank the people who worked tirelessly to get Lida here—in particular, Mat, in my electorate office, who refused to give up hope that Samsoor and Lida would be reunited. This is just one good story that ended well. There are 3,000 others waiting for their humanitarian visas. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australia holds 33 per cent of the world's uranium deposits. It's the world's third-largest producer of uranium after Kazakhstan and Canada. After Glasgow, Alan Finkel, a former Chief Scientist of Australia, stated that Australia must consider nuclear energy as a part of our mix as it offers net zero emissions. Australia is perfectly placed to take advantage of this resource. There are large supplies of uranium, nuclear energy will reduce our energy costs, we will be able to supply energy to South-East Asia and we will be able to sell uranium and technology to the rest of the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear technology has advanced a lot in recent years. Modular reactors can fit on the back of a truck and be transported, molten salt reactors can't melt down, and built-in water cooling systems now exist. Modular reactors have many advantages. They are small, cheap, easy to establish and suitable for the Australian electrical market. Nuclear energy can use the existing poles and wires and is a great mix with coal, gas and renewables.</span>

Some people find their calling and know from a very young age what they are going to do with their life, and this is what happened to Bega Valley's Boyd Exell. Like many country kids, he's always had a deep love and fascination for horses, so when his teacher introduced him to carriage driving there was no going back. Boyd won his first Australian pairs championship when he was just 16 years old, and since then he has become practically unbeatable in the sport of carriage driving. In fact, he's been crowned world champion five times and has won the FEI Driving World Cup championship eight times, with his most recent win coming in Stockholm just this week.</span>

Boyd is out there on the world stage doing Bega and Australia proud. He has worked incredibly hard to get to the point where he dominates this sport, and he's a perfect example for country kids from all over Australia who may have big dreams.</span>

We have been on this pathway for six years. It is six years since I first raised in a public meeting in Kimba the possibility of putting our hand up for this place. I understand there is a group that is opposed to this going ahead, and we have listened to their voices, but, in the end, you can't listen to every voice, and the majority is going to have its way. </span>

So 45 jobs in that population will make an incredible difference. There is a $300 million facility to build, and it is my intention to draw that out as long as we can to make sure we maximise the benefit to the local community and build capacity in the community, which will then be able to generate services for the rest of Eyre Peninsula. We are going into the third round of a $2 million community grant funding program. There is $8 million for facilitating the capacity in the town and a $20 million trust fund that I think will sit in perpetuity. There is $3 million for the Barngarla. There is proposal to bring the school in, to bring in STEM funding and agriculture and to generate extra capacity off this great decision. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

From 89 finalists from around Australia, this Territory company were acknowledged for the growth in their business and the growth in their exports. They sustainably harvest fish and coral for aquariums around the world. In 2011 Monsoon Aquatics became the first company to sustainably export coral, and more recently they have been engaging in a world-first program of coral aquaculture, where they're spawning endemic Australian coral with a view to commercialising this particular practice and product. It's world-leading stuff and it's a very exciting development. </span>

This award is a direct reflection of all their hard work and effort they've put into the business since it was established in Darwin in 2008. They're now operating in three states. It's very impressive. Monsoon Aquatics was just one of seven Territory businesses which made it to the finals of the export awards, and I want to congratulate them all. We're very proud of our Territory businesses. We have ingenuity and innovation, and Monsoon Aquatics have done us proud. </span>

On Sunday that men's shed was officially opened. The Men's Sheds movement is a great Australian success story that has seen a staple of the Australian backyard evolve into a vital component of communities all around Australia and indeed the world. Men's sheds are at the centre of so many communities across Barker, and I'm so pleased that we can now add Berri to the growing list of sheds. In fact, I'm a member of all 25 men's sheds in Barker, and I enjoy dropping in when I can to have a cuppa and to catch up with the shedders. They have formed integral parts of their respective communities. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Good mental health is based on a number of factors, including feeling good about yourself, feeling productive and valued by your community, connecting with friends and maintaining an active body and an active mind. Becoming a member of a men's shed gives a man that safe and busy environment where he can find many of these things in an atmosphere of good old-fashioned mateship. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Millions of people across Australia are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and it's in no small part thanks to our pharmacists. There are close to 6,000 community pharmacies across Australia and, while they weren't included in our vaccine rollout from the beginning, ever since they've joined the race vaccination numbers have safely and steadily risen. In fact, according to the Australia Immunisation Register, pharmacists have administered over a million doses of AZ and over a million doses of Moderna and are now administering the universal booster Pfizer at a rate of 3,000 jabs a day. As a pharmacist of over 20 years, I would like to personally recognise the contribution of pharmacists to helping keep Australians safe, and I was pleased to join those efforts as a volunteer immuniser at Kanwal Village pharmacy in my electorate. It's a critical role and is becoming more vital as we face emerging variants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, unfortunately, pharmacists aren't always properly recognised for the work they do. Given the training, compliance requirements and time taken for pharmacists to support the vaccine rollout I don't know how the government can justify their remuneration. According to the government's own schedule of payments, pharmacists are paid as little as $16 for first doses, $26 for second doses and $16 for boosters. Healthcare workers doing the same job deserve to be paid the same. Pharmacists are some of the most trusted and most accessible healthcare professionals out in our communities, and there are around 70 towns in Australia that have no GP or other health service but do have a pharmacy. These communities and communities across Australia rely on pharmacists, and pharmacists deserve proper remuneration—same job, same pay.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  In 2009 I initiated the Casey Apprentice/Trainee of the Year Awards to recognise and reward excellence and achievement and to encourage careers in local trades and small business. A committee of four prominent local business leaders was formed to decide on the finalists and the winners for each year, a difficult task given the number of nominations. They volunteered their time, and they have done so since 2009. Mature-age apprentices over the age of 30 have been chosen as overall winners in a number of years. The winners have come from a range of industries: manufacturing, horticulture, landscaping, electrical, plumbing, glazing and automotive. This year will be the 13th year of the awards and my final year given I am not standing at the next election. Of course, I hope the next member for Casey continues the tradition.</span>

I think it's something special that a group of four people who donate their time to do this have stayed together for all those years in dedication to our local community.</span>

It's the leading cause of the climate crisis. We need to reduce emissions 75 per cent by 2030, but Liberal and Labor are taking us backwards. If you don't have a plan to phase out coal and gas, you don't have a plan to deal with the climate crisis. But, instead of phasing it out, Liberal and Labor want more coal and gas. They have plans for 116 new coal and gas mines. This burns our future, it burns our reputation, it endangers people with every extreme weather event, it affects our national security and it will wreck our economy. The Liberals' plan is a joke. The Nationals don't take it seriously, and neither will the voters of Kooyong, Higgins or Brisbane. But the Labor Party isn't taking the science seriously either, opening new coal and gas mines. But I know that the voters of Macnamara, Griffith and Richmond take our safe future seriously.</span>

It's time to draw a line in the sand: no more coal and gas. So, before too many people lose their homes, their livelihoods or their culture, let's kick this terrible government out and put the Greens in balance of power so we can push the next government to act before it's too late. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Yet something very dark is happening in the anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown protests. Extremists are exposing vaccine-hesitant audiences to anti-Semitic propaganda on a wide scale. Jewish news outlet Plus61J reported that over 100,000 users now follow Australian anti-vaccination pages that promote anti-Semitic bigotry. In Melbourne, recent anti-vax protests were attended by several prominent neo-Nazis and addressed by a speaker who once decried the influence of Australian Jews in media and business. The organising page of the Adelaide anti-vaccination rally claimed, 'Satanic Jews run the health industry.'</span>

Days before the anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom, a Nazi flag was flown directly opposite the Brisbane synagogue. As Plus61J's Oscar Kaspi-Crutchett notes, RDA and the UAP should acknowledge and denounce anti-Semitism in their movements.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  This government is lifting the veil of secrecy from cowards that are online trolls. I, along with many of my colleagues, have been advocating for reforms that would give Australians the same rights online as they have in the real world. The recent announcements made by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General do exactly this. They will further protect Australians from harm online and hold big tech accountable. It sends a strong message to those who wish to send violent toxic content and slurs online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear about what we are talking about tackling. It's not about the slings and arrows of public debate or censoring the Left and the Right, as those opposite want to do. It is about predators targeting and bullying a 14-year-old into suicide. It's about vile predators who harass a person about their looks to the point of them developing anorexia. This is what we are tackling, and Australians have every right to go online without being abused or trolled. Those across from me should support it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under these new powers social media companies will be declared as publishers, meaning they are liable for the defamatory remarks unless they actively assist in identifying anonymous trolls. This important reform will help those parents who feel helpless to protect their kids online or to unmask the bully or predator that is targeting their children. For too long social media companies have taken massive profits and turned a blind eye to the effects on the end users. Along with our other measures, we are going to continue to act to keep Australian families safe online.</span>

This is a huge number of Australians seeing through this government's lies, and they are joining our fight for fairness. Since launching the petition just a few months ago, this issue has resonated deeply right across the country for those already on the card and those worried they'll be forced onto it. Australians have seen the evidence, and they know the Liberal and Nationals are coming for them next. As the chair of Labor's Protecting Pensioners Taskforce, I have been inundated with heartbreaking stories from those already on the card, people who have been cruelly directed by this government about where and when they can spend their own money.</span>

Labor will keep fighting this all the way, every single day. Thank you to groups like No Cashless Debit Card Australia and the Say NO Seven for your tireless work, and thank you to the 45,000 people who have signed the petition. Let's keep it going. Let's keep sending this government a message, all the time. At the next election, make your vote count. Vote Labor, because only a vote for Labor will scrap these cruel cashless debit cards for good.</span>

I rise to welcome the progress and work from SA Power Networks along Lower North East Road in my electorate, where they are undergrounding a section of powerlines from Gorge Road down along Lower North East Road across the front of the Campbelltown shopping centre. This is an excellent project because one of the unfortunate things about my beautiful city is that, when they installed the electricity network, we didn't have good, reliable trees, so all of our powerlines are held up by these rather ugly cement slabs with two railway tracks along each side. That's how we strung the electricity network in Adelaide.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wherever we can, whenever we can, it's good to invest in burying the powerlines, putting them underground and creating an excellent outcome for the streetscape. This presents an opportunity for us to deliver the vision of the Campbelltown City Council: the Campbelltown Urban Village. After we underground the powerlines, there will be an opportunity to undertake further streetscaping and beautification of that area. It will be a great outcome for residents. I'm an enormous supporter of that project. There's more work to be done on it, but it's an excellent start as we see SA Power Networks undertake this project. Over the next 12 months we'll get rid of around 1,000 metres of overhead powerlines so we can get on with that project and deliver it locally.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  If there's one thing about politics that unites people across my community, it's a deeply held—almost desperate—wish for better standards: better standards of behaviour, of debate and of integrity. The despair and cynicism about politics, the loss of trust, and the distinct and depressing feeling that those who are currently in power just aren't held to the same standards as your average person but are in it for themselves and their mates and not for their community have only increased under this Morrison government, with the scandals, the pork-barrelling and the displays of, quite frankly, bullying, macho behaviour that this government—this Prime Minister—has been known for.</span>

But it also put forward reforms to make this place—parliament, politics and government—better. How is it that members of parliament don't have a code of conduct? It's just not good enough.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  More than 1,600 jobs were on offer at Townsville's jobs fair hosted in the electorate of Herbert earlier this month. That equated to around four jobs per person for the people who came through the doors. These jobs fairs are a fantastic government initiative which aims to bring together employers and employees, connecting them with job opportunities. Jobseekers not only had the opportunity to meet with potential employers but also took part in workshops and were able to receive individual support to help them brush up on interview skills and resumes. It was pretty encouraging to see a lot of younger jobseekers walking around in suits and ties, looking at the jobs board and going over and speaking to potential and future employers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this event, it was really good to speak with businesses that are looking for staff. It was good to see the people out there wanting a job, asking: 'What are you looking for? What do I need to do to be competitive to get this job?' </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's pretty encouraging to see jobseekers out there at the jobs fair asking what the employer wants. It was good to get employers to look at resumes and say: 'Have you thought about explaining this better? Have you thought about explaining that better?' I think that's what we need to be doing, especially in my electorate, to be able to get these 1,600 jobs filled. These were skilled and unskilled jobs, but there were jobs for everyone, and I encourage job fairs to be active around the country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This year the 2021 WA Premier's Secondary Teacher of the Year Award was won by Cowan's very own Charan Pabla from Girrawheen Senior High School. Charan believes education is a pathway to a better life and has a focus on making science and mathematics fun and interesting. Gosh, I wish she had been my maths teacher back in the day! Charan has inspired students to attend national and international youth science forums and pursue further studies in science and medicine. Well done, Charan. Congratulations. The 2021 WA Secondary School of the Year award was won by Ashdale Secondary College in Cowan. Go Ashdale! It's just down the road from my house, it's a great school community, and I've had the pleasure of getting to know them over the last five years. Congratulations, Ashdale. This is so well-deserved. </span>

Thanks to all the kids who entered. Your artwork was fabulous. Congratulations to all the winners this year from across the schools in Cowan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  [by video link] Last week I received an email from Rachel Crosswell, the Tasmanian coordinator of the charity Hope in a Suitcase. When kids are placed in emergency care, they often leave with simply the clothes that they're wearing on their backs. If they're able to grab a few things, they're lucky—throw it in a plastic bag, maybe. Hope in a Suitcase's mission is simple: to provide each child with their own suitcase filled with items like toiletries, clothing, something to cuddle, a blanket and a few things for fun. The suitcases are a vital reminder that they are loved and have worth at a time that they need it most. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hope in a Suitcase relies on donations from the public in order to undertake its important work. It's no surprise that on the north-west coast of Tasmania donations are pouring in. Burnie's Carmen Guard, an active foster carer, has been instrumental in that. Carmen has helped Hope in a Suitcase get up and running along the coast, and she is currently the sole drop-off point for donations. For Hope in a Suitcase to continue to do their important work, they're looking for more businesses to be used as drop-off points for donations. My office has put up its hand, and I'm encouraging other businesses right across our region to consider supporting this great local charity. Please get in contact with my office if you feel you can help give these kids hope.</span>

He might also explain why he stuffed up the national vaccine rollout; why he failed to establish a national quarantine system; why he encouraged the New South Wales government not to lock down east Sydney when he had a chance, leading to the virus escaping to my region; and why his incompetence led to the New South Wales government stealing our vaccines. All of these things the Prime Minister must explain. He must be honest. He must explain to my constituents why he is attacking the health outcomes of my constituents, because the truth is that the Prime Minister is happy to come up to Williamtown, have the red carpet rolled out and have <span style="font-style:italic;">Top Gun</span> played on a soundtrack, but, when he flies out, all that is left behind is cuts to our health outcomes, cuts to our services and attacks on my families.

In this place, we are not just members; we are also employers individually. Each and every one of is an employer and we as employers have responsibilities to make this workplace as safe as it possibly can be.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today Commissioner Jenkins has provided the report to all of us, and the government are happy to table that report. This report, I think, goes to the root causes here that we have had to address in our workplaces. This is a challenge that those of us who have been in this place a long time have known and have experienced over that course. It deals with the issue of power imbalance. It deals with the issue of gender imbalance. It deals with the issues of accountability and an independent complaints mechanism, which I'm pleased we have already taken action on, as we have with counselling support and other services. We didn't have to wait for this report before taking that action. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend again Commissioner Jenkins, as indeed I have already commended Brittany Higgins. It was her speaking up that led to this chain of events that has brought parties together in the multi-party process that has been working together to produce this set of recommendations. I now look forward to us continuing to work together in a multi-party process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations cover the full terrain, I think, of the issues that need to be addressed. We need to come together now and work to those together to ensure that this place becomes a safer place and sets standards for all who work in this building. The surveys that are in this report don't just relate to the staff of members of parliament and senators; they in fact relate to all people who work in this building, whether it's in the press gallery or elsewhere amongst members and senators. So it is important we read this, reflect on it carefully and understand what Commissioner Jenkins has rightly set out as the drivers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier today, we have the great privilege to work in this place, and all of those who are here also have that privilege. The significant matters of state and the importance of our work and the stressors that we work under are no excuse whatsoever for inappropriate behaviour, bullying, harassment or any of these things. There is no place for that in this workplace or any other. So I join with all members of this House, including, I'm sure, the Leader of the Opposition, in condemning that behaviour and doing all we can to make this a safer workplace for everyone in this building, and that this is also the truth for those who work outside this building as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We know that, as a result of this pandemic, the immediate impacts have certainly been there, both physical and economic. But there will be a tale of impacts on Australians' mental health as a result of this pandemic that Australia has stood out in addressing amongst the nations of the world. And I thank the member for her contribution to that in her professional capacity and as a member of this House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the pandemic our government has always taken an evidence based and expert informed and led response to save lives and livelihoods. We've always understood that we need to get the balance between those, and that is what we have achieved. We have kept our heads. We've taken sensible, balanced, effective and cooperative action in our response to this pandemic, and the results, with the great support, endurance and strength of the Australian people, have been world leading. We have one of the lowest fatality rates in the world from COVID, saving more than 30,000 lives in this country as a result of our combined efforts. We have one of the strongest advanced economies in the world to push through this pandemic, retaining our AAA credit rating. In the last five weeks, the Treasurer advised, 350,000 jobs have come back after the lockdowns have ended, and we'll see that flow through into our economic figures in the months ahead.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world now, at 87 per cent of people with a double dose. Western Australia and Queensland are fast approaching that all-important 80 per cent mark. We have confronted many challenges and overcome them. The national plan we brought together, and brought the states and territories together, is seeing Australia open safely so we can remain safely open. And the work that Australians have done has put us in the position now, as we confront these new variants—there have been 13, and we'll deal with this one. The work that has been done by Australians means that now is not the time for turning back in terms of moving forward in our response to this virus.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have taken the sensible precaution for a two-week pause on the next steps that we had, and we will examine the evidence and the advice that comes through. We welcome that advice and we've acted on that advice. Our response to omicron is sensible and balanced and informed and calm. We seek to maintain the momentum into Christmas so we can continue to open up, as Australians have worked hard to have those freedoms. The government can, over time, continue to step back so Australians and the businesses they run can step forward. Premiers are meeting this afternoon. The flights have been suspended for this period of time, and we've reinforced the strength of the PCR testing regime, giving that enforcement capability. We're enabling Australians to continue to move forward. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. One of the most urgent actions taken in the course of our response to the pandemic as we looked into the abyss back in the early part of 2020 was to move quickly to ensure that we could put in place a system where those coming into Australia would quarantine. Together with the states and territories, who are meeting together with me again this afternoon, we put that scheme in place and supported them to do that. We followed that up with the establishment of the national resilience facility in the Northern Territory, which has a capacity of 2,000.</span>

                  </a>  I note that those opposite make reference to the hotel quarantine system. I can tell you that in that system, while certainly not perfect, in the context of the hundreds of thousands of people who came through, on less than 10 occasions—not as the member put it in the question—there were breaches in that scheme that led to the outcomes that the member referred to. In the context of hundreds of thousands of Australians who were coming back over that period of time, I thank the states and territories who we worked with closely to put this into place.</span>

                  </a>  I thank them for the work they did. Those opposite may wish to condemn them, but then that would be the same thing they have done throughout this pandemic. They're happy to say they support so long as, on the other hand, they can undermine. That's why it hasn't been our experience that we've had the confidence to rely on those opposite. We have forged the way of this government on these benches and with other governments around the country because those opposite simply couldn't be relied upon.</span>

I might bring some attention to some of the derisive sneers that have happened across the chamber at a person who has been a very accomplished businessperson, who has stood behind the great city of Gladstone. There's a derisive sneer towards the member for Flynn. There is a derisive sneer towards the people of the great city of Gladstone and the people of Central Queensland. It follows their usual line of thinking that regional people are somehow below contempt. But the minerals industry is so vitally important for our nation. Look at exactly what Australia produces: iron ores and concentrates of nearly $153 billion in exports in 2021; coal of over $39 billion in exports—and I'll say a little bit more about that later on; natural gas in excess of $30 billion; education related travel services at $26.6 billion; gold—another mineral—at over $26 billion; beef at $8.3 billion; aluminium and ores at over $8.1 million. That's followed by copper ores, crude petroleum and then wheat. In those top 10, one is from the service industry. Everything else is from primary production.</span>

We indeed have, and they were there to support the broader quarantine arrangements that were put in place necessarily with all the states and territories because of the sheer volume of arrivals that would come back to Australia and need to be accommodated in that way. The Labor Party seems to think that we would have somehow established facilities to accommodate 100,000 people around the country. That's simply absurd. So we came up with a practical, innovative solution, a solution that was actually followed by the New Zealand government. I don't hear those opposite criticising the Labour government in New Zealand about having hotel quarantine, but they're happy to criticise their own government for doing it. They're happy to criticise the Australian government for taking exactly the same response to the New Zealand government, which tells you everything about this Labor opposition when it comes to the handling of the pandemic. </span>

I will resist responding to the sneering interjections of the Leader of the Opposition, because what Australians know is, as a result of the response to this pandemic, more than 30,000 lives have been saved by the very arrangements we have put in place with the states and territories. Those opposite might want to sneer at that and not support it, but this country has come through this pandemic and continues to move through this pandemic, particularly in response to new variants, and we are dealing with omicron now in a calm, sensible and balanced way. We'll deal with other governments on these issues, because we know that, when it comes to the pandemic, the Labor Party always plays politics before putting forward the national interest. </span>

Official data released today shows emissions have just gone up by two per cent under your government, but the independent Climate Targets Panel has determined that, for Australia to meet the Glasgow Climate Pact requirement to keep global warming below 1½ degrees, emissions must be cut by at least 74 per cent by 2030. Given Australia will be required to update our targets in Egypt next year, will you take a 75 per cent by 2030 target to the next election, or is the only way we are going to get science based climate targets to kick your terrible government out and put the Greens in balance of power? </span>

That's what they hope for. They're calling themselves shadow ministers down there in the Greens. I tell you what: they'll never be in an alignment with this government. There never will be and there never has been a Liberal-Nationals-Green government, but I do know that the Labor Party in government did a deal with the Greens to bring in the carbon tax. I know they formed an alliance with the Greens the last time they were in government. I remember the photo. It was almost as shameless as the photo we saw with the former Leader of the Opposition, with all the hubris, measuring up the curtains before the last election. There they are, getting ready and thinking the Greens and Labor are going to walk onto the Treasury bench of this country.</span>

They actually did it when they were last in government. I remember many years ago—I think it was before the 2004 election—when Lindsay Tanner, a former member for Melbourne, said: 'If it's a close election, we might have to do some of the crazy things the Greens want us to do.' That's what the former member for Melbourne said, and now a Greens member sits in that former Labor seat just as a Greens leader would seek to sit in a Labor government.</span>

I can tell you that we have a target for 2030 which we took to the Australian people at the last election and which we will meet and beat, and we will see emissions fall by 35 per cent by 2030. The Labor-Greens target is not set yet. They still haven't told you what they want to do in 2030. There is no plan by 2030. There is no plan by 2050. We've been very clear that we will do this through technology, not taxes, but Labor, forced by the Greens, will tax you on that issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last March, consumer and business confidence fell to their lowest levels on record and we saw thousands of our fellow Australians, having lost their jobs, lining up outside Centrelink. Treasury were forecasting that unemployment could reach as high as 15 per cent. We responded with programs like JobKeeper, the cash flow boost, support for veterans and carers and pensioners and others on income support, and Australia, ahead of any other advanced economy in the world, saw its GDP higher than it had been going into the pandemic and its employment rate higher than it had been going into the pandemic.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we were hit by delta and our two largest states went into lockdown. We responded with around $20 billion of economic support. Now restrictions are easing and our economy is on the road to recovery. There are new variants like omicron, and we know that we are in a strong position to respond, with one of the highest vaccination rates in the world and one of the strongest economies in the world. This is our track record. After the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression, unemployment today is lower than when Labor left office.</span>

You've allowed both alternative policies and alternative approaches. What the Treasurer's doing now is neither. He's not referring to an alternative policy. He's just giving a character assessment sledge. He's not referring to an alternative approach. He's just giving a character assessment sledge. If we go down this path, question time continues to go downhill. In terms of the standards of the place, this is beyond what the question invites on direct relevance.</span>

That is a report I commissioned and that led, in the process to developing that report, to the decisions that were taken for the additional facilities that are being completed in Victoria, in Queensland and in Western Australia. Those facilities are important not just for what we may have to face next year for the more severe cases that may have to be taken—and we've discussed those with state governments—but for pandemics that may present in the future. That's why we have invested in those facilities. So I would only encourage those opposite, as Australians continue to push through this pandemic and as we continue to face these new variants of concern—and it is a variant of concern, but we've dealt with many before. What I know from, certainly, the Premier of New South Wales—and I appreciate the measures that they've taken in relation to this most recent variant—and I believe the view is also held by the Victorian Premier, is that we don't want to return to the arrangements that were put in place for those in quarantine facilities—that is, in hotels. They are moving now to home quarantine and isolation, and that is how we live with the virus and we live together with the virus.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have been playing politics with this pandemic for 18 months. Australians know that our government has worked closely with others to ensure that we have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. They know that, coming through this pandemic, we have one of the strongest economies of the advanced economies in the world and that we have one of the lowest rates of fatality from COVID of any country in the world. What part of those three results, that many other countries—in fact most around the world—would happily exchange places with Australia to have achieved, do they find so offensive? Why is it that this opposition, constantly, throughout this pandemic, has not sought to support but has only sought to undermine for their petty political purposes?</span>

Indeed, just in the last 24 hours there were another 650,000 cases worldwide and over 7,300 lives lost officially. So the pandemic, which some would almost pretend is not a pandemic but uniquely an Australian event, is in fact a global pandemic which has wreaked profound impact around the world. Thankfully, Australia has had one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, one of the lowest losses of life in the world—with over 30,000 lives saved by comparison with the OECD average, and 45,000 lives saved by comparison with those agonies we've seen in the great nations of the United States and the United Kingdom—and one of the strongest economic recoveries. All these things have come together.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The programs we put in place to protect Australians—borders, testing, tracing, distancing and the vaccination program—have worked together through these rings of containment to give Australians some of the strongest outcomes of any nation in the world. Let us never forget, as a parliament, that of all the nations in the world Australia is one of the few with a loss of life that is so limited. Each life lost is to be deeply regretted but no nation is immune. But few nations have done better than Australia. That's what is fundamentally important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we face the latest news about the omicron variant, we know that the very systems that were established on our watch, in our time, have been put in place immediately. On Saturday, off the back of the briefing with the Chief Medical Officer and the health secretary, the Prime Minister instructed: that we take steps to cease flights from the southern African nations; that we, sadly, put in place a pause on non-Australian arrivals from the southern African nations; that we ensure there is quarantine for those who have been in the southern African nations; and that we ensure that all those who had already arrived in Australia were put in quarantine. These elements have come together. They are saving lives and protecting lives now. Additional measures have been taken by the National Security Committee overnight with regard to new arrivals and pausing those for 14 days. Together these actions are protecting Australia and continuing to protect Australia.</span>

We are doing exactly that, as recommended. I reinforce what I've already said to this House. Over the course of this pandemic the arrangements we put in place, unlike other countries—the Minister for Health has just made the reference to OECD countries. Had we gone down the same path and not taken the steps we did take, more than 30,000 Australians would be dead today. Thirty thousand Australians would have perished in this pandemic were it not for the timely and effective measures this government put in place, working with the states and territories to ensure that result. And not only that but, with the economic strength this country has shown through the course of this pandemic, some 350,000 people are coming back into work. We ensured that the structure and strength of our economy was maintained through the pandemic so it can be springing back now, after the lockdowns are over, and we are seeing Australians going back into work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was talking to the Confederation of Australian Industry this morning. Throughout the pandemic Australian businesses were taking advantage of the investment allowances we put in place in the budget to set up for the economic recovery. Their vote of confidence in the Australian economy in the midst of a pandemic shows great character, great resilience and fortitude, and that is what is setting up the opportunity in the years ahead. But we cannot take that economic recovery for granted. Australia must secure this economic recovery, and that requires the continued economic policy settings which our government has put in place for a business led recovery, for an enterprise led recovery, for an entrepreneur led recovery—not having government crowd that out, as those opposite would do in not understanding when it's time for governments to step back so Australians and Australian businesses can step forward. The higher-taxing DNA of the Labor Party will only risk that recovery, and that's why we must secure that recovery with the policies of our government.</span>

Late last week we became aware of the omicron variant, which presents a range of new challenges for us here in Australia and also globally. It's very early days. The world is yet to have a complete understanding of it. Here in Australia we need to learn more about that particular variant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this government took the very sensible step last night to place a two-week pause on stage 2 of our planned border reopening from 1 December. It will be a 14-day pause from 1 December for a number of cohorts that we had previously indicated we were going to be able to open to. Those cohorts include economic workers, skilled workers, international students and humanitarian and refugee temporary visa holders. Also we have had to pause our reopening to citizens of Japan and South Korea. That pause will be in place for a period of 14 days to make sure that there is time in Australia particularly for our health professionals to understand more about this new variant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a decision that the government took lightly. We know that many plans had been made. We know that businesses are desperately wanting skilled workers and they need those skilled workers here. We know that visa holders in Australia want to be able to see loved ones, many of whom are overseas and they have been separated from for a very long period of time and many of those people want to come to Australia to visit us here. So we are very mindful of the impact that those border changes have on many individuals, on many families and on many businesses here in Australia. We certainly feel for all of those who have been affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we took this very sensible and this very prudent decision based on health advice. That advice was that we needed to put in place a pause on the next stage of reopening our international borders. The Morrison government are absolutely committed to doing all that we can to reopen those borders as soon as we possibly can, but we need to do that in a very safe and considered manner. That's why the decision was taken last night that we would pause the international arrivals that we had planned to allow into this country as of 1 December.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be very conscious as we move forward that we need to bring in those skilled workers. Again, the Morrison government will do all that it can to make sure that we open our international borders as safely and as quickly as we can. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Leader of the Opposition may not be aware that, in order to prepare a budget next year, the normal practice is to ensure there are a set number of weeks for the preparation of that budget before the budget is delivered. As the Leader of the Opposition may not be aware, in order to prepare a budget next year the normal practice is to ensure there are a set number of weeks before the preparation of that budget and before the budget is delivered. I have personally delivered three budgets as Treasurer and three budgets as Prime Minister, and I have served seven years on the Expenditure Review Committee. I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition would be unfamiliar with the time taken to prepare a budget, because he's never delivered one. There are people who have been serving refreshments in the Expenditure Review Committee longer than this person, the Leader of the Opposition, spent in that chamber. </span>

This is why the Australian government has entered into the AUKUS arrangement with both the United States and the United Kingdom, to make sure that we can take steps to keep our country safe and secure now and into the future. And, as part of the deal on AUKUS, we have of course announced that we are going to acquire, to build, at least eight nuclear propelled submarines. That gives them the stealth and the ability to operate in the Indo-Pacific to protect our country and our interests and the interests of our friends. Part of that process means that there needs to be a consultation through the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to sign off on the deal. </span>

In here, they say they're in support of AUKUS, and when they get outside they tell a very different story. I noticed yesterday that the member for Fremantle, in relation to this IAEA process, in relation to our country, Australia, said that 'we will have broken new ground in weakening the existing non-proliferation regime'. Now, those words sounded familiar, because when you look at those that have contributed through the process at the energy agency, there are only two other countries that are making a claim that Australia is not doing the right thing here. That is the Chinese government and the Russian government—those two. So, Comrade Wilson, you're on message, and 'weak leader' here would be very proud of you. </span>

                  </a>  is to get the best brains at our universities to work with our business leaders to convert their great research into products, into new companies and, ultimately, into jobs and wealth creation. This close collaboration between academics and businesses occurs so well in places like Silicon Valley and the innovation country of Israel, but in Australia we know that we can do better. To be fair, we have brilliant research. We punch above our weight in primary research, but on nearly every metric of research commercialisation, we don't do as well as we should be doing. We want to change this. We want to be more like the United States. We want to be more like Israel in this regard, where universities do work with business to create new products, to create new companies, to drive the economy to create wealth for the nation.</span>

                  </a>  Last week we announced a first step towards seeing this happen. We are investing $243 million in what we are calling 'trailblazer universities'. These are going to be universities that are hungry to aggressively go down the research commercialisation path and that can showcase to others how it can be done. They are going to be trailblazers. They'll be focused on this task. They'll receive $50 million each in order to do the job to recruit the best and to purchase kit. In exchange, they'll be focused very much on research commercialisation, have industrial relations frameworks to underpin it and absolutely showcase what can be done in this area.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been warmly welcomed by the business community and university leaders alike. The Business Council of Australia, for example, said that this will 'help give us an edge in the global battle to turn our ideas into new industries, new jobs and new opportunities'. Universities Australia said that this investment 'will ensure that the best and brightest can play their role in our nation's recovery from the pandemic'. This is what this particular program is going to do. It is the first instalment of our research commercialisation agenda. There will be more to come. We want to see our universities work with industry to create the jobs of the future.</span>

They don't want an integrity commission; they just want to engage in the slurs. Criminal and corrupt conduct is the sort of conduct that sent former minister Ian Macdonald to prison, which the Leader of the Opposition was a keen supporter of.</span>

Whilst it's not technically a breach of the standing orders, it is sailing close to the wind. I would just ask the Prime Minister and all members to be very, very mindful that, whilst an accusation may not allude to criminal conduct, there is a form of guilt by association type arrangement. I would ask the Prime Minister to be careful with his wording, please.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Northern Australia and Deputy Leader of the National Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:08</span>):  I thank the member for Nicholls for his question. I acknowledge the rich and very proud history that the Nicholls region has in producing some of the finest food and fibre in the world. It will play a significant part in Australian agriculture reaching $100 billion and, in fact, will play a significant part in us this year, for the first time in our nation's history, reaching $70 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He knows better than anyone that innovation plays a very important part in providing our farmers with the tools to be able to provide the best food and fibre in the world. That's why we're investing in and modernising our innovation systems, making sure that we put the environment in the framework. We are currently ranked No. 23 in the world, but we have set ourselves the target of becoming No. 1 in the world. We have the same number of researchers and scientists as the United States and Netherlands, who are fourth and sixth in the world. All we have to do is put the environment around the best and brightest in the world that are here to achieve that goal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are doing that by firstly creating Agricultural Innovation Australia, which will get back to the first principles of utilising the $1.1 billion of R&amp;D levy dollars that go into making sure our farmers have that research money. That comes from the taxpayer and the levypayer. We're getting back to the first principles of value to the levypayer and taxpayer, no duplication and commercialisation of what we are doing. AIA has started that journey of making sure that we're removing the duplication of research across the 15 commodity RDCs that are there at the moment, saving millions of levypayers' and taxpayers' dollars, getting real value for dollar for us and making it go further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also giving AIA the tools to be able to do this properly. For the first time, we've created a digital platform, growAG. What that does is put all the research and development that our 15 research and development corporations have undertaken and are undertaking on a digital platform that the world can see and that, in fact, other commercial entities can see so that they can invest. So far, since April this year, when we launched this, there have been over 40 commercialisation opportunities that have come from that, not just from Australia but from around the world. Over 15,500 customers have looked at it, from over 130 countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also backing this with physical platforms where people can come and see and feel and touch the research that we are doing, because that's where you get the adoption. We're putting one out near Shepparton at Dookie college, where we're partnering with universities to make sure that cutting-edge research can be developed and farmers can actually see and adopt it. This is making sure that we have a closed loop in terms of the environment we're creating to ensure that the investment dollar that we are putting up and that the farmers are putting up is partnering with new commercial capital. This is having real results not just in driving innovation but in protecting the over 330,000 jobs in agriculture while also creating the new jobs of agriculture into the 2030s and beyond.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E3L" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORRISON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  As discussed with the Leader of the Opposition prior to question time, on indulgence and very briefly I wish to pay tribute to a formidable force in Australian cinema and Australian cultural life, and that is David Dalaithngu AM. He was a gift from our country, a gift to our country, who, through dance, song, art and the stage, allowed our country to see a better self. He was a mirror to the soul of Australia. On stage, television and the big screen, David shone and reflected something massive back to us: the 60,000-year history of Indigenous people in this country. We all knew him. Many in this House would have seen him for the first time, I suspect, when they were young children, as Fingerbone Bill in <span style="font-style:italic;">Storm Boy</span>, Moodoo in <span style="font-style:italic;">Rabbit Proof Fence</span>, Neville Bell in <span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rocodile Dundee</span>—showing another side to his great talents—King George in <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span> or the tracker in Rolf de Heer's film of the same name.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">David was of the Mandhalpuyngu clan of the Yolngu people. He was grounded in the rich traditions of those people. Schooled in multiple languages and living in a community that kept performance cultures alive, he understood story and meaning. He carried himself with elegance, grace, dignity and beauty. According to historian Dr Amanda Harris, who has written extensively about the history of Aboriginal music and dance, he had a strong desire to tell his own story, the story of his culture, the story of Australia. She said: 'He saw the arts—dance, music, opera, acting—as acts of diplomacy and dialogue, acts that could bridge divides and let us see each other as we truly are.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was always something bigger about his work, and that was reflected on stage and screen. It is often said that David lived in two worlds. It wasn't easy for him to bridge this gap between his two worlds. But one thing brought those ties together, and that is that he was a storyteller. He allowed Australians to see something richer. In lauding him, we should not rob him of his joy, his cheekiness and the ease with which he carried himself. On occasion he'd begin an acceptance speech with the words 'I deserve this'—and he did. The director Peter Weir recalled when they first met. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As I was leaving and got in my old car, you leaned in through the window and said to me, 'I've told you very special things, Peter, just for you … And just remember, as you drive away, my shadow will be beside you in the car.' And I remember driving off and looking at the passenger seat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this day, we say to David that he deserves the accolades and we know his shadow is beside us. This country, its history, its joys and its travails were the essence of his being. To his family, his friends and his people we extend our deep sympathies for their loss and Australia's loss. May he rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  David Dalaithngu faced the end with the same grace with which he carried himself through so much of his life. Contemplating the final stretch, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's like, I'm walking across the desert of country, until the time comes, for me.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now the time has come. Australia has lost a great actor, dancer, painter and writer, a proud Yolngu man, a great Australian, a rare human being, a titan. From the moment the 15-year-old David first graced the screen in <span style="font-style:italic;">Walk</span><span style="font-style:italic;">about</span>, it was clear that Australia was witnessing the emergence of more than just another fresh face. At a time when non-Indigenous actors were still being cast in Indigenous roles, here he was, bringing his own culture so vividly and mesmerisingly alive on the screen. More than just a film role, it was a turning point. As the great Jack Thompson put it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think it was the first time I'd seen the Aboriginal culture presented on-screen as not only interesting, but dynamically attractive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The script was slender, just 14 pages in total, but director Nicolas Roeg was a visionary. And, above all, he had David. In the words of Shane Danielsen in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Monthly</span> earlier this year, he was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the kind of secret weapon a filmmaker dreams of: a figure of coiled energy and casual, effortless grace. Someone who commands the screen simply by the act of allowing themselves to be photographed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That his performance was no fluke of beginner's luck was made clear just a few years later when he became Fingerbone Bill in that great movie, <span style="font-style:italic;">Storm Boy</span>. As his filmography grew, so he grew as a remarkable and powerful presence in our cultural life. David himself was succinct about his own talents, telling an interviewer: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I don't pretend. I don't have to go and act, I just jump in and stand there and the camera sees me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He knew the bright lights of Hollywood, but he never stopped holding onto the glow of his own country. Arnhem Land was always waiting for him, and it rarely waited in vain. He held onto his roots because, ultimately, they are what nourished him. As for his role as a Yolgnu ambassador out in the world, he put it this way: 'Everything right, for my culture. I made it true.' The road wasn't always smooth for David—that was something he never shied away from—but he walked tall in two worlds with grace, truth and humour. Now he walks in another place. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROWLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  Going into the 2007 election, Labor took a policy to the Australian people that spoke to a smart future in which the transformational power of ICT would be harnessed for the betterment of all Australians, irrespective of where they lived or worked. But it also spoke to a decade of policy failures under this conservative government when it came to broadband, including when Telstra was privatised as a vertically integrated monopoly, entrenching the disincentives to invest and to engage in the best consumer welfare. They sold out the needs of rural and regional Australia. We had a litany of half-baked proposals that left Australia languishing as a broadband backwater in a region that was investing in fibre as the best form of communications infrastructure. Their hearts just weren't in it. If you needed any proof that absolutely nothing has changed since that time, we only have to look at eight long years of technological incompetence, cost blowouts and policy backflips to prove that their heads aren't in it either. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing encapsulates proof of this more eloquently than the incoherent, rage-induced response by the minister opposite to the positive and well-received policy announcement by myself and the Labor leader recently to invest $2.4 billion, expanding fibre access to up to 1½ million additional premises currently relegated to a copper service under those opposite. It's noteworthy that up to 660,000 of these premises are in the regions. I think this media release is a timely reminder of why the minister opposite shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a keyboard when he's in a bad mood. There was so much tension in this media release you could've cut it with a butter knife, and even the shareholder minister, the Minister for Finance, wouldn't put his name on it. It was too much for even Senator Birmingham. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's be clear. It's difficult to know where to start with this rant of a statement by the minister on 17 November, but I'll give it a go. I'm going to start at the end. I want to remind members this minister, along with those geniuses Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott, abandoned fibre. They said their NBN would be a multitechnology mix incorporating copper and HFC. They said they'd deliver it quicker and cheaper. They said it would cost $29 billion and be finished by 2016. The price tag today is $57 billion and counting, and around Australia we've still got about 200,000 premises on copper that can't get the minimum broadband speeds required by law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September last year, in the most humiliating, wasteful, expensive policy backflip in the history of the federation, this minister announced—wait for it—that they would go back and they would build the fibre. After all that, what's the punchline? What's the punchline from this minister? What's his knockout blow in his last line? 'Only the Coalition can be trusted to deliver an upgraded NBN.' You can't make this up. Let that anti-logic sink in for a moment. It's the stuff of satire. It truly takes a unique lack of self-awareness to issue a statement like that. If we follow this statement to its illogical conclusion, the minister is arguing that only the Liberals can undertake a technology repair job that would not have even been needed if they weren't so incompetent to begin with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just be clear about what that is. I mentioned 660,000 premises in the region benefiting under Labor's policy. We've got this other pearler in the minister's media release: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's clear that what Labor proposes here is more wasteful government spending of taxpayers money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear. In Labor's original proposal, 93 per cent of the fixed-line footprint would have fibre, not copper. Millions of additional premises in regional Australia have been relegated to copper under this minister, and this minister's view is that to upgrade those people to fibre is wasteful. I look forward to every rural and regional member opposite coming in to back in their minister. I look forward to the Liberal candidates for Eden-Monaro, Macquarie, Gilmore and Corangamite all coming out to back in the minister. I think I'll be waiting a while.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what else in our announcement speaks to the Labor mission. It's a modest one, but it makes a real change to the lives of children and their families. We know from ABS data that prior to COVID there were around 55,000 households in Australia that didn't have any access to the internet. For whatever reason, they had no access to the internet at home. The first time we actually obtained this data was during lockdown when we had remote learning going on, which became the norm for many of us. Schools, various state education departments, carriers and NBN Co intervened with mostly temporary solutions to help these students, and that's a good thing. I've heard firsthand about the difference that assistance made. But I tell you what: it's still estimated that there are around 30,000 households around Australia where there is still no internet at home, for whatever reason.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have announced that Labor, working with NBN Co and the retailers, will give free internet access to those households for a year. We'll do that while we work on a long-term model. In some cases it might be quite bespoke, depending on the needs of those houses. Central to the Labor mission is equality of opportunity for everyone in Australia, regardless of your income, regardless of your postcode and regardless of what country you or your parents were born in. That is the Labor mission. We know Australians are looking to the future. We want to be better prepared in the new normals we have going forward—how we work, how we study. It speaks to Australians needing to have the best—not the substandard, but the best. We have got the substandard under this government. We are ranked 59th in the world for average broadband speeds. We are ranked 32nd out of 37 nations in the OECD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would put money on the minister's script, on what he is going to come and say in response to this. It's a document called 'same old talking points'. Consider this: the minister's response every time, just like he did only a couple of weeks ago, is to talk about 2013. Let's consider this: these tired old arguments have been systematically proven wrong over the past eight years on every single count. And consider this: we have Labor talking about the future and making it better, and all this government can do is talk about the past but neglect to mention all its failures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about a future narrative here—how to make this national piece of utility infrastructure better for our needs in the post COVID world. It's very clear that COVID has demonstrated that reliable, quality, accessible high-speed internet is not a luxury or a nice-to-have. We said this all along: it is essential, 21st century, economic infrastructure. A future made in Australia requires the best-quality communications infrastructure. Optical fibre is the right technology to shape our future. We said this all along: do it once, do it right and do it with fibre. It's always been the right technology. It's not just about speeds; it's about our national story and asserting the kind of country we aspire to be. I tell you what: if Labor want to be a leader in the digital industrial century, not just a participant, we have to do better. That is our aspiration—a future made in Australia, a future shaped by the best-quality ICT.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've known all along that the NBN is a critical piece of national infrastructure. But this tired, decade-old Liberal-National government can't be trusted when it comes to technology. They always get the big calls wrong on technology, just as they get them wrong in other portfolio areas—including energy. They always get it wrong. For them, it's always about short-term politics and never about the long-term progress of this country. That's why only Labor can deliver a better NBN and be trusted to shape our future the way it should be. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  I want to start with an area where there is agreement between the government and the opposition, and that agreement concerns the fact that the pandemic demonstrated that, more than ever, people really value having reliable, high-quality broadband. Overnight, millions of us moved to working and studying from home, and we really needed a good broadband connection to get through that period. Indeed, when the pandemic hit 98 per cent of Australian households were able to connect to the NBN. That meant they could have access to a reliable, high-speed service, one offering good upload speeds as well as good download speeds. Compare that to the previous generation of broadband DSL, which offered lower broadband speeds down but, particularly, offered very low speeds up. If you're videoconferencing you need good speeds in both directions. When Australians turned to the NBN in their hour of need, they found it was there and it was reliable. In a very real sense, the NBN, a ubiquitously available, good-quality broadband—with 98 per cent of households around the country able to connect to the NBN—was critical in getting Australia through the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that there is agreement between Labor and the government on this, the first question, in terms of the language of the motion before the House this afternoon, is: does the fact that there was 98 per cent availability of the NBN demonstrate mismanagement of the NBN?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Or, does it, on the contrary, demonstrate that our government, the Liberal-National government, has managed the NBN in a way which allows that to happen and we did so, notwithstanding the fact that in 2013 we inherited a train wreck of a project from those opposite? When we came to government, Labor had spent $6 billion and they'd had six years in government, and, at the end of all of that, there were barely 51,000 premises connected to the fixed line NBN around Australia. By contrast today, there are 8.3 million premises connected around Australia with 77 per cent of those on a speed of 50 megabits per second or higher and there are 12 million premises that are ready to connect. So you will see that it is chalk and cheese between the train wreck that we inherited and the methodical, systematic process that we have gone through to deliver a rollout such that, by 2020, 98 per cent of all premises were able to connect. If we had stuck to Labor's ill-conceived original plan, then, in 2020, when the pandemic hit, there would have been several million fewer households able to connect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been a matter of good fortune for the nation that our government has been in charge of the rollout of the NBN, in contrast to the chaotic and demonstrated incompetence of the NBN implementation in the years that Labor was last in government. The NBN under the Labor government missed every target they set themselves in their business case. In their corporate plan, issued in December 2010, they promised that by 30 June 2011 there would be 223,000 premises passed or covered. The actual number: 10,500. By 30 June 2013, they said there'd be 1.221 million premises passed or covered. The actual number: 235,000. It's a remarkable display of incompetence, because Labor cannot deliver. They have no competence at execution. They have no competence at delivery.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mess that we inherited was not easily turned around. It took a lot of detailed, sustained work. We had to put in place a competent, capable board and management, because the previous government hadn't bothered to do that basic thing. We had to come up with a workable, deliverable strategy so that we could get the network rolled out as quickly as possible. Labor had a fetishistic insistence on connecting fibre to the home of every premise around Australia within the fixed-line footprint, regardless of whether the customer wanted it—Canberra knows best! You may say you don't want to order a speed that needs fibre, but Canberra knows best, and we are determined to roll a fibre to your home whether you want it or not!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key consequences of moving to the multitechnology mix was that it was more capital efficient. The latest numbers from the NBN corporate plan: fibre to the node, $2,330 per premise; fibre premises in brownfields, $4,395—$2,000 per premises more. Now, if you want fibre to your home and you're prepared to order a service which needs fibre, then there's a logic for providing that. But, if you don't want fibre, why does it make sense to spend more than $2,000 extra per premises? This is a basic piece of logic which Labor has struggled with for a very long time. By contrast, not only have we delivered to a point where now over 99 per cent of all premises can connect but what we also did last year was lay out a way forward for the NBN. We did what we said we would do back in 2013—that we'd get the network rolled out and we would continue to upgrade it to drive fibre deeper into the network in response to customer demand. So what we committed to last year was a plan to spend $4.5 billion under which, by 2023, eight million premises around Australia will be able to order a speed of up to one gigabit per second. That is blazing fast broadband. Implicit within that is a footprint of two million fibre-to-the-node premises where we will roll fibre down the middle of the street and, as soon as the customer chooses to order a speed which needs fibre all the way, we will then build the fibre lead-in. That is the business-like way to do it. That is the logical way to do it. That is the capital-efficient way to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's extremely interesting is that, despite all the fiery rhetoric from the shadow minister, Labor have adopted our policy and they have said they are going to have exactly the same approach. They are going to only connect fibre to the home when the customer chooses to order it. It's perhaps not surprising that the shadow minister hasn't chosen to emphasise that particular complete backflip in Labor's approach. But the fact is that, when you look at Labor's track record of execution, the question in front of the people of Australia today is: who can be relied upon to do what they say they are going to do in rolling out the National Broadband Network? The fact is that, when you look at what we said we were going to do in 2013, we have done exactly what we said we would do. A consequence of us having been in government for the last eight years is that, when the pandemic hit, 98 per cent of premises around the country were able to connect. If Labor had still been in government and had stuck to their original plan, if they had maintained their dismal track record, when 2020 came along and the pandemic hit millions of premises would have been unable to use videoconferencing or other technologies which require the current generation of broadband.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say this to the House: it would have been very little consolation to those Australians unable to access good-quality broadband that Labor had bold aspirations, that Labor had a bold vision for the future. Visions are very easy to articulate. They had lots of visions when they were in government between 2007 and 2013, but across portfolio after portfolio, including communications and including the NBN, they could not deliver. That's because they are hopeless. They are beyond hopeless when it comes to delivering. They have no business experience. They have no capability in this area. When we came to government in 2013 we got under the hood of this project and looked at their track record when it came to the NBN, and what a complete train wreck we inherited. What a dismal mess it was. We have methodically turned it around. Thanks to that, when the pandemic hit, 98 per cent of premises were able to connect to the NBN. We continue to upgrade it. I say to the Australian people: look at the track records of the two major parties; only one of them can be trusted to deliver the NBN.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  After eight long years of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, Australians are entitled to look back and ask, 'What has been the point of that?' As it heads into its ninth year and as it prepares to ask the Australian public to start a second decade in office, what has been the legacy of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government? You really have to feel for the historians of future generations. When they set about trying to tell the story of the achievements of this government, they are going to confront a very difficult challenge indeed. The first thing they are going to have to do is dig through a mountain of marketing guff, because those opposite—across Abbott, across Turnbull and across the Morrison government—certainly know how to produce a pamphlet. One cynic has gone so far as to call this model of government a 'pamphletocracy'. But, for all of its glossy graphic design and marketing slogans, this government has never had anything at the heart of it. It's never had a vision for the kind of country it was setting out to create or a policy agenda for how to deliver it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even worse, they haven't just taken up space and they haven't just wasted time; the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government have actively taken us backwards. The only thing that they have set about doing with any zeal has been trashing the policy achievements that had been put in place by the previous Labor government. There's no better example of this than the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this MPI, I have delved into the back catalogue of this government's pamphlets for a deep cut. Tony Abbott's 'real solutions' election pamphlet—do you remember that one?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a classic; it's a real classic. I was looking at it this morning, but I couldn't see the current Prime Minister on it. He didn't make the cut back in 2013. That's how many prime ministers and leaders this government has churned through. Prime Minister Morrison didn't even make the top six in the Abbott government in 2013. But this one is full of their greatest hits—and I know the members opposite are really looking forward to this one—like 'we will get the budget back under control, cut waste, start reducing debt and start delivering real budget surpluses'. Do you remember that one? It's a good tune, isn't it! Take a breath. Remember to breathe. It is breathtaking, I know! Because since then those opposite have delivered eight consecutive budget deficits, with a ninth in March in the new parliamentary sitting calendar that we saw recently. They doubled the deficit before COVID hit, and now we are left with $1 trillion of Liberal debt as a legacy for the nation going forward. And what do we have to show for it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm distracted by this. It's the NBN commitments I'm most interested in here. The first Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government pamphlet promised that this government would 'deliver broadband faster, sooner and at less expense to taxpayers and consumers than Labor's National Broadband Network.' It's almost as embarrassing as the deficit quote, because, despite this pamphlet-thin commitment, Tony Abbott also explicitly asked Malcolm Turnbull to demolish Labor's fibre-to-the-home NBN, and he did that and then some. When he axed Labor's fibre NBN, Malcolm Turnbull announced that he'd deliver a multitechnology mix NBN for a total cost of $29.5 billion. What they've delivered is a copper and HFC NBN that cost nearly three times as much—$57 billion. It's a $28 billion budget blowout. That's even bigger than the $20 billion blowout that they wasted on JobKeeper payments to companies that increased their revenues in the pandemic. So it's a big one in policy failures under that government. It's billions of dollars more than it would have cost to deliver Labor's full fibre-to-the-home vision for the NBN. It's a special achievement to bungle a policy so badly that you deliver half as much for twice the price, but that's what happens when all you have is a political strategy rather than a policy vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has led the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government to sacrifice this nation's future in pursuit of short-term political interests. Here we are, eight years later, and what do we have to show for it? Australia is ranked 59th in the world for average broadband speeds and 32 out of 37 OECD countries. An Anthony Albanese Labor government has a vision for the future of our country and the courage to pursue it and the plans to deliver it, a vision for Australia to be a leader in the new digital economy, not just an international follower. We'll restore the original vision of the NBN as well we can, given the mess this government has made of it. We'll extend the access of a full-fibre NBN to 1.5 million homes and businesses. An Albanese Labor government will make sure that NBN Co invests an additional $2.4 billion to boost fibre to the country making sure that 10 million premises in Australia have access to a gigabit connection by 2025. That's 90 per cent of Australian businesses, and we'll keep NBN Co in public hands while we do it.</span>

What do you really say to that? We used to hear a lot about the vision at the dispatch box, the vision about what Labor would do if they are elected, but some of us were actually there and remember the vision that Labor had when they were last in government about communications. I remember their vision for the NBN Co. It was on the back of a napkin, I think, and conceived on a flight.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HAWKE:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, on the back of a napkin. See, that's the problem when you have a vision but you don't have the know-how to implement something as important and technical and practical as a national broadband network. I remember also Labor's original rollout of the NBN didn't go to important places like hospitals and business parks. In my own electorate, the largest business park west of Parramatta in north-west Sydney wasn't on the rollout plan. Why wasn't it on the rollout plan? The member for Greenway had a lot of streets and suburbs on her rollout plan in the original rollout of the NBN. It wouldn't be because it was a marginal seat, would it? Some whole suburbs and streets had rollout plans, yet hospitals were not being connected to the NBN nor were critical manufacturing and other facilities that needed NBN access. These are the wrong priorities that Labor had with their initial rollout of the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We remember their record on communications, and the public shouldn't forget it. I remember very clearly the wonderful phrase 'mandatory internet filter'. What a wonderful idea that was of the Labor Party's in office—to filter the internet. For five years they promised a mandatory internet filter, talking up their record on communications. They're the tech heads, to quote a former Prime Minister, the ones that understand communications. They tried to filter the internet for five years. It was five years before they had to kill this egregious waste of money that attempted to filter the internet. Thank goodness that went to bed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also good that the coalition got elected in 2013. I highly recommend our <span style="font-style:italic;">Real Solutions</span> brochure—good reading. And the Australian public saw that as well. They saw it and they voted for the coalition again in record numbers, another one of those election victories. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Real Solutions</span> pamphlet was an election-winning set of policies. By the time those opposite had left office, 51,000 users had been connected to the NBN. At the time, if you remember back to that period, you couldn't get a subbie anywhere in Western Sydney to do anything, because all of them were chasing the NBN contracts from Labor. You might say: 'Great—that's fantastic. They were trying to build the NBN.' The reality was that, under Labor, under the mismanagement of the people they put in place, under the egregious amounts of money that they were offering, every subbie knew that, if you worked for the NBN, you'd be paid two to three times what you would be paid in any other job for less work. Subbies were literally not doing any work for anybody else, because they were being paid three times for the same work. Now, what company, corporation or anyone could afford to pay three times the price for the delivery of a service? Of course, a Labor-run facility. So, when the member for Gellibrand says, 'We want it in public ownership,' what he means is completely and utterly incompetent administration run by the Labor Party. And people shouldn't forget the cost of that, the cost versus the service. There were just 51,000 users after all of that waste. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the coalition do? We came to office. And, of course, that's why people elect coalition governments, because they get real solutions. And what did we do with the NBN? Well, we actually fixed it. We made it work. We got it ready for the pandemic. And thank goodness the coalition had been elected to office before the pandemic, so that, when people needed it, the NBN was there. It was there for people at home and in their businesses. We connected business parks, we connected hospitals, we connected people to the services they needed—the productivity driving force that this was supposed to be all about. The coalition's plan wasn't on the back of an envelope. Yes, it was in detailed policy brochures. We don't apologise for that. It wasn't a mandatory internet filter that we focused on for five years and then scrapped because it was a complete waste of time and energy. This was the chaos that Labor represented in all areas of policy, and communications were no different. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor wasted $6 billion on the NBN, for just three per cent of Australian premises. We came to office and we got it fixed. The NBN is working, it is viable and it is delivering for Australians. Again, that just shows that this coalition government, the Morrison government, has delivered real solutions for people. It is continuing to do the job—not just the vision but the 'how' you are going to get the job done. Only a coalition government can be trusted. </span>

Let me tell you the story of Ron. When it rains, his fibre-to-the-node connection stops. There's nothing. And what his customers get is a message telling them that his number doesn't exist. So, there's Ron, running a sound and light production company, and yet, with a drop of rain, his customers get told that he just doesn't exist. Now, how's that for the party who reckons they stand for small business? </span>

But the main problem he has now is that he cannot run his business in the Blue Mountains. He cannot get the upload speeds that he needs, because fibre to the node is a substandard technology. He has to commute down to Sydney, to Gore Hill, where his production company sits. This is what this government has done to people who'd hoped to be able to base their business in the mountains. </span>

The one thing that lets him down is his NBN connection. We've tried everything we can to help Aaron because he doesn't want to have to wait for Labor to come in. He knows that when we win government he will have fibre to the premises, which his customers and visitors will absolutely love. They'll be able to stay there not just for a weekend but for some of their working week as well. But they can't right now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Aaron's been told is that he is more than a kilometre from a node. He can only get 21 megabits per second download and four megabits per second upload. How do you upload your photos to Facebook or Instagram with that? You can't do that, let alone do your work. He is being let down by this government. It is ironic that it's a government that pretends it cares about small business, when they are exactly the people the government pushed aside and said, 'You don't count,' when fibre to the node was rolled out to the upper Blue Mountains. That was a failed experiment. These people knew it was a failure, because they didn't roll it out to the lower mountains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will fix the upper mountains. We will make sure that anyone who wants it will be able to get it. Aaron did ask the question, 'How much would it be for me to get fibre to the premises under the Morrison government's plan?' He was given a neat figure: $12,500 was the quote he got for fibre to the premises. That is beyond his means. It's beyond the means of mums who need their kids to be able to access the internet for school. It's beyond the means of families where there's a student at university and that assignment is due and the fibre to the node is so slow that they can't connect. That's what those opposite have done to people living in the upper Blue Mountains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also applies to great swathes of the Hawkesbury. You've got 4,000 square kilometres in Macquarie and you've given them five different types of technology: satellite, wireless, some fibre to the premises—that would be when Labor was in government—fibre to the node and fibre to the curb. What happens to the satellite people? They're switching off. They are going to Elon Musk's Starlink satellites because they get such good speeds at the moment from that. But they have to pay, and it's only those who can afford to pay, which is the antithesis of what this program which was all about. This program was about equity, giving every Australian a fair go, a fair chance to make their way in the world, to build a small business no matter where they lived. Those on the other side have taken that away from people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People who have wireless are left with this ridiculous technology that also doesn't meet their needs. I have one constituent who works for the NBN who refuses to connect to wireless. One hundred metres up the road people are on fibre to the curb but he can only get wireless. These are the sorts of stupid decisions that have been made by this government and the NBN, guided by nothing other than small mindedness without any vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to finish with the problems with fibre to the curb in the Blue Mountains in particular. When the storms hit and lightning strikes, it goes off. It disappears, little bits of ash come out of your box and your box is blown. We're told the new boxes are better. We're not seeing that. This government has let down everybody in the Blue Mountains.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  I thank the member for Macquarie for her contribution. Let me start by saying that in that contribution we have exactly the reason why Labor's NBN failed so badly. It wasn't about providing telephony and data services to Australians; it was about making sure that their mates in the telecommunications industry got as much money as they possibly could. That's why they talk about equity and all the sorts of things they love to talk about. But they never talk about the opportunity for small businesses. They never talk about the opportunity for households. They never talk about the things that really matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first got elected to this place, in 2016, I met a gentleman by the name of Ben Christie, who runs a global company from Warriewood Valley in my electorate. I say to the member for Macquarie: Ben Christie had been waiting under Labor's NBN for nearly seven years for there to be a connection. He literally had to drive to Parramatta to be able to run his business. The dislocation, the amount of business he lost and the number of people he could not employ due to Labor's incompetence was just extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So when the shadow minister for telecommunications puts up an MPI topic like this, I am torn between thinking that it's some sort of black humour and thinking that she just wants us to have a great laugh at their expense. What could go wrong with a program that was designed off the back of a beer coaster at the front of the Prime Minister's plane as he returned from Townsville in less than three hours? Of course, who of us in this place has not designed a $4 billion infrastructure spend on the back of a beer coaster in less than three hours? None of us, of course, because we are all geniuses and know it all! None of us had experience in rolling out a telecommunications company or data, but that didn't bother Prime Minister Rudd or Minister Stephen Conroy. They knew that they could do it. I thank God that they could not find a second beer coaster. God knows what the two of them would have come up with if they'd had an extra hour on the plane with a second beer coaster! They could have saved this country from who knows what? Let's think of a disaster they could have solved. Given a couple more hours they could have probably spent $170 billion. That's what we have from those opposite. They come up with all this vision. It is preposterous in its statement. It is preposterous in its thinking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the member for Macquarie accusing this government of not caring about people in the upper Blue Mountains when those opposite were more interested in an equitable telephony system than they were in actually delivering services, and why? Because they don't actually care about the practicalities of life. They only care about the ideological outcomes. So now we have people in the upper Blue Mountains who can't get access to data services because of their poorly designed NBN which, once again, those on this side had to fix, just like with the NDIS and just like with the apology to the disabled and people who were sexually abused in institutions. It is always left to this side of the House to actually come up with practical outcomes that make a difference to real people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You won't hear us talking at length about equity. You will hear us talking about equality of opportunity. You will hear us talking about freedom. You will hear us talk about personal choice, like whether you want fibre to the node or fibre to the premises. We don't believe that all wisdom in this nation resides only in this chamber. We believe that your ordinary, average Australian has the capacity to make decisions for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know those opposite don't trust Australians. We know those opposite believe that they are not up to making even the choice as to whether they want fibre to the node or fibre to their premises. We know those opposite believe that these are decisions that should be made in a prime ministerial VIP jet on the way back from Townsville on the back of a beer coaster, because, after all, your ordinary, average Australian does not have the capacity to use a beer coaster! Only Senator Conroy and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd can do that! So we have a project that massively overran and massively undelivered. Once again, it was left to those on this side of the House to fix that problem.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  An Albanese Labor government will fix the sadly botched NBN rollout that the Morrison government has given Australians. We all know that good-quality, fast internet is crucial in today's society. If we didn't know that prior to COVID, we certainly know it now. Working from home, studying from home and simply keeping in touch with family and friends relies on fast and reliable broadband.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many families in my electorate of Corangamite are totally dissatisfied, frustrated and, quite honestly, angry at this government's woeful copper-to-the-node scheme. Some in my electorate don't even have NBN yet, despite the Morrison-Joyce government telling us that the rollout is complete. That's why Labor's recent announcement that we will connect 1.5 million households across the nation to fast fibre was enthusiastically applauded in my electorate. An investment of 2.4 billion to boost fibre access nationally makes absolute sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What doesn't make good sense is why this wasn't done by the coalition government. Instead, the coalition introduced an inferior system, relying to a great degree on copper wire to the home. By international standards, this was never going to cut the mustard. It was short-sighted, and it's limited our nation's productivity. Australia is now ranked 58th in the world for average broadband speeds. It's just embarrassing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I was recently thrilled to announce to my electorate that, under Labor, many areas now struggling with copper wire based NBN will have access to full-fibre high-speed internet in my electorate. That means that places like Bannockburn, Clifton Springs, Portarlington, St Leonards, Marshall, Moolap, Queenscliff and Point Lonsdale will all have access, under Labor, to fibre to the home. None of these areas were earmarked for upgrades under this half-baked proposal by the Morrison government to retrofit fibre to the home under its discredited NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, my office has been flooded with complaints about the coalition's NBN. A local project manager and software developer who works in Waurn Ponds, an urban area in my electorate, tells me NBN is his biggest concern in turning a profit. He says: 'It's so embarrassing. It's frustrating.' Another, David in Barwon Heads, tells me he's battling serious communication challenges with the NBN, at a time when his wife is pregnant and needs to keep in touch with medical specialists. In Torquay, the NBN can be so pathetic, a trickle of between five and eight megabits per second. That's not usable in this day and age for even the most basic of data communications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can this government hold its head up when talking about the woeful NBN that it's delivered to Australians? The truth is that the NBN has been a giant, expensive headache for so many in my electorate and across the nation since the coalition began rolling it out in 2013, and everyone knows it. It's riddled with problems. More than 27,000 Australians made complaints about NBN in 2020, including complaints about slow speeds and poor connectivity. The coalition's failed fibre-to-the-node infrastructure is now going to have to be rebuilt by a Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The irony is that under former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd we were going to deliver a fast fibre based NBN, but it was bagged by the coalition at the time. We had the future Prime Minister Abbott saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… do we really want to invest $50 billion worth of hard-earned taxpayers' money in what is essentially a video entertainment system?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Turnbull in the same press conference said, laughably even by the standards of 10 years ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Should the taxpayer be paying $50 billion to subsidise people staying at home watching movies?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts are now obvious. The coalition have wasted eight years on an inadequate system when they could have rolled out Labor's fibre-to-the-home model right from the start.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does the coalition's failed NBN model matter? Well, it matters to Australians. It matters to them because they want a fast system for their home businesses or for their students to study. It is absolutely imperative that we have a better system instead of this incompetent system that we have under the coalition. So it's going to be up to an Albanese Labor government to fix the coalition's NBN mess, and I look forward to that taking place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance. I would like to start by putting on record congratulations to everyone at the NBN for what they have been able to do in the last 20 months, in particular, since the coronavirus pandemic commenced, with the enormous amount of pressure that that put on internet connections throughout their network across the country. Of course, we all know and understand what happened early on in the pandemic and how people in many cases suddenly had to work from home. This put an enormous amount of pressure on the network. We made some very important decisions as a government to support capacity in the network, and I commend Minister Fletcher for what he did then and also for more recent announcements that he's made regarding the National Broadband Network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to everyone at the NBN, because that system could never have been put under more pressure in such an unpredictable way. As much as we make sure in our critical infrastructure that we're preparing for absolutely anything, the way in which the system stood up to those pressures goes to show not only that they were indeed prepared for a once-in-100-year event like that pandemic but that the system is very agile and nimble and can make changes rapidly. There are nearly, I think, 12 million customers with access to the NBN now. Of course, representing one of 151 electorates like other members here, I've got tens of thousands in my own electorate. It's a thrill to visit businesses, in particular, that are using the NBN in ways that put them in a globally competitive space. Creative industries is a good example. I've got the South Australian Film Corporation in my electorate but lots of other businesses that work in film, in post-production, visual effects et cetera, whose internet connection is very important. A city like Adelaide has a great competitive advantage because it sits nicely on a time zone against the western United States—so, Hollywood—and Europe, and that puts businesses in my electorate in a position to work on projects with other businesses in Los Angeles, London, Paris and Vancouver. They can effectively be doing projects where they're collaborating, where at 9 am, Adelaide time, the team in Adelaide are working on a particular part of a post-production visual effects project and at five o'clock they upload their work of the last eight hours. The team in London pick that up, keep working on the same scene for the next eight hours and then hand that over to someone in Vancouver or Los Angeles, and the cycle continues. That's all facilitated by having a broadband internet system that allows them to collaborate and deal with enormous packets of data in the efficient way this system provides to us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, of course, had to do an enormous clean-up job from what we were left with from Labor after six years. I think they got around 51,000 customers onto the NBN in six years. I suppose it's not, in hindsight, a surprise that Labor could be so slow in rolling it out—an idea that the member for Mackellar has just outlined very eloquently. It probably didn't have as much thought and wasn't robust a concept as it should have been when you're talking about what is now tens of billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. What's even worse is not the mess that was left to us after they had six years to get 51,000 homes on the NBN but the fact that, if they'd kept going and we hadn't been elected and taken over responsibility for deploying the NBN, it still wouldn't be finished by now. The KordaMentha process showed that the NBN under Labor would probably have completed rollout by 30 June 2024. Where would we have been in the pandemic with an incomplete national broadband network? Where would all those businesses have been—those that rely on that network, that infrastructure, that technology, which we fixed, we enhanced and we finished? We got the job done. I shudder to think how businesses would have survived over the last 20 months if they'd had the half-finished system that Labor continued to slowly roll out and deploy. So we're very lucky that the people of Australia made the right decision, threw Labor out in 2013 and voted in support of our approach to the NBN, which delivered a finished system that we continue to invest in and enhance into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  Having fast, reliable, good-quality internet should not be a luxury in 21st century Australia. It should not be something that only people who live in the cities can access, and it shouldn't be the case that two families that live in the exact same suburb should have vastly different internet access. But under this Liberal-National government that is exactly what has happened in Jerrabomberra, a suburb that is only 15 minutes from where we are right now. The fact is that some people who live in Jerrabomberra have had great NBN access and have for many years experienced fast, reliable internet connectivity. But there are also a lot of people in Jerrabomberra who were dudded when this government trashed the NBN model to move to a mix of fibre and copper. In one suburb it all came down to the luck of the draw as to why some people have access to 21st century technology while too many households do not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the Jerrabomberra community was frustrated and angry. The residents and families have been paying the same amount for a vastly different experience. Thankfully, the Jerrabomberra community didn't sit by and accept this ridiculous situation. They have stood up and made noise for over a decade now. They have called out this government for the rollout and demanded that they receive the same access as their neighbours and the wider Queanbeyan community. Now, after years, the NBN is finally being rolled out to Jerrabomberra. The government is having to go back and fix what it got wrong in the first place. This tired, decade-old Liberal-National government cannot be trusted when it comes to technology or broadband. They have deployed a network that cost twice as much but does half of what it's supposed to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor had a vision and a plan to ensure Australia was a leader in the digital industry, not just a participant. But then this government came in and butchered the NBN rollout. For them it's always about short-term politics and never about the long-term progress of the Australian people. Big announcements, no follow-through and botched rollouts have become a legacy of the Morrison government. The government promised to save taxpayers money by cutting corners. They said they could deliver something just as good at half the cost. This is just another untruth. This government has delivered a masterclass in technological and economic incompetence. Australia is now ranked 59th in the world for average broadband speeds and is 32nd out of 37 OECD countries. It's almost unfathomable that the government has spent nearly nine years and $50 billion on a second-rate network. Rather than realising their mistake early on, they doubled down, launching tirade after tirade about fibre. Then, just like that, around the corner in Jerrabomberra they are crawling back to the very thing they argued against. This not only vindicates Labor's policy but proves something many Australians have long suspected to be the case: the Liberals get the big calls wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I decided to run for the seat of Eden-Monaro I was determined to make a difference to the lives of the people I now represent. I vowed to advocate for my communities to get the education, the infrastructure and the services they deserve. I represent a broad and varying electorate, but there's one thing that everyone agrees on, from Eden to Tumut, from Yass to Cooma, and just down the road in Queanbeyan: for our kids to get ahead, for them to learn and succeed into the future, they need access to reliable internet. This is no longer a want. This is no longer a luxury. This is a vital part of our lives, whether you are in the city or in regional Australia, and this has become even more apparent during lockdowns when our children were learning from home and parents were working from home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our communities need an NBN that works. This is why I'm proud to talk about Labor's plan for the NBN, because Labor has a plan that will benefit people in regional Australia. A Labor government will ensure 90 per cent of Australians in the fixed-line footprint—over 10 million premises—will have access to world-class gigabit speeds by 2025. Labor will keep the NBN in public hands, keeping internet costs for families affordable while ensuring improvements to the network take place. This is key. We cannot privatise something that is fast becoming a basic need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, Labor's expansion will benefit regional Australia, which you can see has been left behind by the Morrison-Joyce government. This is, quite frankly, on stark display following the COVID pandemic. Labor will provide up to 660,000 additional homes and businesses in our regions with access to optical fibre. This investment has the potential to transform the digital capability of our regions, grow our local businesses and industries, and attract more. This is something that will benefit and serve our regional communities for decades to come. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  Under the management of this government, more than 8.3 million premises have connected to the National Broadband Network, and there are currently 12 million premises ready to connect. What that means is that today almost every home and business in Australia can order a service of at least 25 megabits per second—much faster than was available when the rollout began. In fact, today 77 per cent of homes and businesses are on 50 megabits per second or higher plans. This compares to 70 per cent in October 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government's management, NBN Co continues to deliver strong financial and operating performance. Earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation, including subscriber costs, amounted to $714 million in the first quarter, up from $102 million in the corresponding period last financial year. Total revenue achieved was $1.25 billion, up 17 per cent over the corresponding period last financial year. Over the period 30 June 2021 to 31 October 2021, NBN Co repaid an additional $5.3 billion on the Commonwealth loan facility, reducing the outstanding balance from $13.2 billion to $7.9 billion. This included successfully raising $2.8 billion from the US bond markets in early October.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NBN Co's monthly progress report for October 2021 showed that the network was up and running 99.96 per cent of the time. Average network bandwidth congestion being experienced by NBN consumers was around 21 minutes per week, well below the four hours and 52 minutes of July 2017. Also, 98 per cent of homes and businesses were connected within the target time frames agreed with phone and internet providers, recovering from 89 per cent in March 2021, when issues with a new workforce scheduling system adversely affected some connection and appointment metrics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us contrast this record of achievement with that under Labor. The NBN was a complete mess. After six years of Labor, just 51,000 users were connected to the NBN. Labor paid $6 billion for the NBN to pass just three per cent of Australian premises—a rollout that was so badly managed that contractors downed tools and stopped construction work in four states. Under Labor, the NBN missed every rollout target it set for itself. Labor's approach would have cost billions more, taken years longer to complete and left millions of Australians behind during COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month, NBN Co announced a sixth tranche of suburbs and towns across Australia that will become eligible to upgrade to NBN's fibre to the premises, with a number of suburbs in my electorate of Moore set to benefit from access to ultrafast broadband. The announcement brings the total to 1.6 million premises of the two million target. This next stage will see another 200,000 premises eligible, many of which are in the Moore electorate, which will drive significant benefits to the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NBN Co is working with its construction and delivery partners to get premises across Australia ready to upgrade to ultrafast speeds when they choose to do so. This represents a key part of NBN Co's $3.5 billion investment that will see 75 per cent of Australia's fixed line network able to access ultrafast broadband by 2023. Towns and communities across Australia will benefit from being able to access ultrafast broadband. This will create jobs in the community, ensure local businesses can access the speeds they need to thrive, and improve connectivity for families in the entire region. The city of Joondalup has the potential to evolve into a digital hub supporting software development, cybersecurity, advanced information technology— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  I would like to first acknowledge the Ngunawal and Ngambri people, who are the traditional custodians of the Canberra area, and the Dharawal people, who are the traditional custodians of the lands of my area. I pay my deep respects to their past elders as well as my respect and great appreciation to current and emerging leaders in my community with whom I have had the great privilege of working.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to deliver my valedictory with mixed emotions. I am very conscious of the fact that, in deciding to not contest the next election, like other colleagues who have done this, we get the opportunity to deliver a valedictory. This makes me very aware that there are also members who don't get this opportunity. So I do feel some ambivalence about delivering this speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware that the challenges that face those who are returned or elected for the first time at the next election are extraordinarily significant for the future of their community and the nation. The challenges all our communities have experienced since early 2020 have profoundly revealed aspects of our society and economy that have not been operating in the most effective way for all Australians. The challenges of disconnection from community, from health services, from dignified and reliable work and from educational opportunities have been highlighted during this time. The more vulnerable in our communities were the hardest hit by the necessary shifts made to how we operate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw this impact directly in my community too. People in casual and contract work and people in sectors not provided support from government were laid off. Frontline workers in often-underpaid sectors were stretched to their limits in stepping up to do their jobs to protect their community. Families were juggling work from home and homeschooling in partnership with our schools, often without good broadband connection. The challenges that were faced and met showed the great resilience of our community but also showed where we need to improve for the future. We must learn lessons from this period and deliver better policy legislation and programs to strengthen and improve, not just slip back into the same flawed structures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of challenges for reform and growth of our economy and society have always been part of the great Australian Labor Party project and part of the purpose of the broader Labor movement. I wish all strength to our Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, to our talented and dedicated frontbench and to our whole Labor team. It's clear from already-announced policies across climate and environment, across infrastructure, industry and manufacturing, across workplace relations and job security, and across social supports and an inclusive society that they are already well advanced in offering to Australians at the next election the solutions we need to emerge stronger and more inclusive after this challenging time. I anticipate, with great joy, celebrating election night with our local team, cheering on an Albanese Labor government being elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been an enormous honour and a great joy to represent my local community in this parliament. I am acutely conscious that public debate has become more fractured and uncivil over recent years. But I have to say that local people have almost always approached me, on the multitude of traditional and new platforms available to them, with civility and respect. Even when they profoundly disagree with my view or position on an issue, they express that to me passionately but civilly. It's my sincere hope that we can all continue to debate the great and the small issues with passion and conviction in a robust debate that challenges our thinking but never sinks to aggressive or, indeed, violent expression. Thank you to each and every person across my community who has supported me, challenged me and disagreed with me but also trusted me to be their voice in this place. I will continue to do this job for you with all my heart and energy up until the election.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I begin my extensive thankyous; I promised the whip I'd keep to time! After nearly 18 years in this job this is an extensive list, because to be effective in this job requires working with so many others to achieve results. I actually first came to work in this place in 1995 as a staffer for former member for Throsby Colin Hollis. Can I just give a shout-out to all staffers, whose commitment and dedication to public service is such an important part of our work. It's not my view that this isn't a legitimate pathway, among many others, for someone who decides to put themselves forward to represent their community in public office.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I returned to work in this place as the member for Cunningham after the 2004 election, it was with a profound sense of honour and responsibility. The nature of the job has certainly changed significantly over the following years. When I was first elected I had a MySpace account and a mobile phone that was not internet connected. I am ambivalent about the rapid pace of technological changes, as to whether they have helped or hindered in doing my job.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over those years, I have experienced nearly all the variety of opportunities for participation. I've been in opposition and government—yes, government is better! I've been a backbench MP, a parliamentary secretary and then a minister, a shadow minister, a committee chair, a deputy chair, a committee member and a member of the Speaker's panel. I've been present at some of the most moving and powerful expressions of humanity and celebration in this chamber: Prime Minister Rudd's delivery of the apology to the stolen generations, the achievement of marriage equality, the delivery of legislation for a national disability insurance scheme and the first day of the first female Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, just to name a few that come to mind. There have been so many moments of humanity, humour and challenge, big and small, in speeches and special occasions. I will never forget being introduced to President Barack Obama by Prime Minister Julia Gillard or my brief moment speaking to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't always cover ourselves in glory in this place, but the outpouring of support and appreciation by the Australian community when we reflect hope and optimism does show us how much they crave this from us all. Participating effectively and fully in all that goes on in this place relies on some wonderful professional people who support this work. I would like to acknowledge the impressive professional staff in this place who support the work of committees, those in the Parliamentary Library, all of the Clerk's team, the dedicated, quiet people around us every day, such as our attendants and cleaners, and the myriad of other staff who keep our show on the road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other aspects of the Canberra part of this job that I enjoy is catching up with colleagues from around the country, hearing how things are going in their local area, giving and receiving friendship and support and working together on important issues. Over nearly 18 years, of course, some of these have come from the other side, but I won't name them. I do appreciate the friendship in competition that has been extended by quite a few over the years. In my own party I've been blessed with a richness of friends and colleagues who have inspired me, supported me and challenged me to be better. Many are not here anymore, and I can't possibly name them all, but I do want to single out Prime Ministers Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, who both expressed confidence in me by appointing me to ministerial roles and who it was a great honour to work with. I've been proud of the leadership of Bill Shorten and Anthony Albanese. It has been an enormous honour to work with you as part of your teams over these years in opposition, which I am certain will end with a move to the other side of this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It won't surprise anyone that I would in my valedictory refer to my long-time policy passion for the education sector—our schools, our TAFEs and apprenticeship system and our university sector. I've been privileged to work with many colleagues on this policy area, and I certainly look forward to a stronger future for it under my inspiring colleagues future minister Tanya Plibersek and minister and Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to give a special thank you to my class of 2004 colleagues, whose friendship and support has been wonderful—you'll be glad we were a fairly small class—particularly to my best mate, Justine Elliot, who is hiding behind me here, who has listened to all my problems over the years and celebrated the good times with me. Justine did a Facebook post when I announced my decision. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Sharon and I were elected together in 2004, and we've famously voted opposite ways in EVERY single Labor leadership ballot since then. Despite that, we've always remained great friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Absolutely, Justine, and we will remain great friends too!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our class included other great friends: Kate Ellis and Peter Garrett, who are already out in the post-parliamentary world; my good friends Chris Hayes and Julie Owens, who are heading out with me; and the rest of the amigos who stay on to fight the good fight—Chris Bowen, Tony Burke and Steve Georganas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been privileged to work with so many of you wonderful Labor people, including those who were here when I arrived like Anthony, Tanya, Joel, Cathy, Brendan, Anthony, Warren and Maria. Each of you, at different times and in different ways, has offered me support and friendship, and I thank you. So many amazing people have joined our team since I was first elected. I am inspired after each election at the quality, passion and dedication that new members bring to our caucus. I see all of you now contributing as shadow ministers, as policy thinkers, as community advocates and as colleagues, and you fill me with great confidence in the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the last 18 years have most importantly involved working in partnership with so many wonderful local people—peak organisations and community groups across the Cunningham electorate. Every aspect of my job has been strengthened by the advice, feedback and support they have provided in advancing the interests of our wonderful community. Thank you to each and every one of you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is Arthur Rorris and the South Coast Labour Council and all the affiliates. Arthur is one of the only local leaders to be in his role for longer than me, and I have valued his advice and support. And I give a shout out to my own unions over my working life who are affiliates, the NSW Teachers Federation and the Transport Workers Union.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is Adam Zarth and the previous leaders of the Illawarra Business Chamber as well as smaller chambers such as Port Kembla and Northern Illawarra, and I give a special shout out to Paul Boultwood of Corrimal Chamber.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are all of our amazing local multicultural organisations and support groups, with a special thanks to some who have worked with me since I was elected: Ken Habak and Chris Lacey and the team at MCCI and SCARF Refugee Support, and Giovanna Cardamone and the team at lTSOWEL.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are our tremendous disability support employers and support organisations: Chris Cristodolou and the whole team at Greenacres, Roy Rogers and the team at Flagstaff, and Margaret Bowen and the team at The Disability Trust. These leaders have also been serving their community for nearly all of my time, but there are so many more with other groups and organisations that I have been privileged to work and campaign with for a fairer future for people with a disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many other church and charity groups doing really important work in our community, and they have really been called on during bushfires and COVID even more. The fact that there are too many to name individually shows how strong our communities are and how compassionate they are towards the needy and vulnerable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a truly impressive group of surf clubs—Matt Thistlethwaite knows them well—with a long history of community service, and it's been a great privilege for me to help out you and your volunteers whenever I can. I know none of you would resent my singling out of the most amazing man, who we recently and unexpectedly lost, Keith 'Cocky' Caldwell. He never ceased informing, engaging and, of course, lobbying me on all surf club issues, not only for his beloved Bulli club but for the whole movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our community is also extremely well supported by our local RSL clubs, not only through their holding of important services throughout the year but also through the welfare and support services they provide to our veterans. It's been an honour to work with all of you and, again, I'm sure you will be okay with me singling out today the extraordinary service of our beloved Peter Poulton, who we sadly lost recently. I missed your presence on Remembrance Day, Peter.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former teacher, I have loved working with all our local childcare and education providers, our local schools, our local TAFE and our world-famous university. There are so many impressive educational leaders adding greatly to our community. I would like to specifically acknowledge the leaders of our uni over my time, who have partnered with me in achieving significant investments in expanding the research and teaching facilities that have helped the economic diversification of our region—mainly achieved under federal Labor government investments, I will say. I offer thanks to Gerard Sutton, Paul Wellings and our new VC, Patricia Davidson. It is so wonderful to see the first woman, and a former nurse, heading our university.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not sure if I am thanking the following organisations as 'partners' other than in the important work that we both do on Australian democracy, so thanks for that to ABC Illawarra, i98FM, WAVE FM, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Il</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lawarra Mercury</span> and WIN TV. As is fitting, our relationship has been robust, but I've valued the service to our community that you all seek to provide and your civil and professional engagement with me. All strength to local trusted news providers!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now for another very special group of people who share the work of advocating and fighting for our local area with me. When I was first elected my neighbouring federal colleague was Jenny George. Jenny is a great advocate for Labor women, and she became a great friend and mentor to me. When she retired, she was succeeded by my very good friend and colleague Stephen Jones. Stephen, it has been an honour and a pleasure to work with you and your team over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been blessed also with a wonderful team of state Labor colleagues: my longtime friend and supporter who's become a strong and well-regarded local leader in his own right, Paul Scully, the member for Wollongong; the energetic and well-respected Ryan Park, the member for Keira; and, whilst her seat doesn't overlap with mine, she's been a strong voice for us in regional campaigns, Anna Watson, the member for Shellharbour. There have also been many terrific Labor councillors I have worked with over the years, and I hope to see more of you elected at the soon to be held—of course, this Saturday; don't forget to vote everyone!—local government elections. I've not had the great joy of working with a Labor mayor, but I certainly hope to close my time in this job, for however many months that may be, working with the first female Lord Mayor of Wollongong, Labor's fabulous Tania Brown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many of you would know, both here in Canberra and in our electorates, every aspect of our work is sustained by the day in, day out work of our dedicated electorate staff. I've been truly blessed with the people who have worked with me over my time. I often boast that one of my most important successes in this role is being able to identify, recruit and keep incredible individuals who love our community as much as I do and who go above and beyond to help those who came to us in need. Thank you to my dearest friend and long-time colleague Alison Byrnes; my amazing current team, Dionne Garcia, Nathan Brown, Idalina Guerreiro, Donna Tetley and Frances Kerkham; and to my past staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Labor team in Wollongong across all levels relies on the strength and wisdom of the wonderful people who are our rank-and-file members. Their compassion and commitment to the cause of Labor, to the people we seek to speak up for and deliver better policies to, and their tireless efforts in policy discussions and campaigning are the work on which we all perform our roles. These party members selected me to represent them as their candidate to win back Cunningham in 2004, and they have supported me ever since. Thank you to each and every one of you. My efforts were strengthened and improved by your assistance to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, my thank you to the group of people who've encouraged me, supported me, hugged me in hard times, fed me in busy times, pushed me to greater efforts if I get discouraged, loved me and given to me endlessly over the nearly eighteen years—the people I want to prioritise in my life now, as they have prioritised me for so long—my family. They mean the world to me, and I know they already know how much I thank them for all that they do for me, but I want to say thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to Mum and Dad, Kev and Bev Reed. I hope Mum got the feed working okay on her iPad today! What you've given me over my lifetime and how you've taken pride and provided support to my public life cannot be contained in words.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to my amazing sons, whose values and character make me so proud and who have loved and supported me every step of this journey—Michael and Chris, and our much loved addition to our family, Chris's partner Youngchae.</span>

Thank you all. Thank you, Kev and Sharon, Rod and Dana, Anthony and Brett and Radmilla.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Gino—my partner and greatest supporter and rock of stability. Never during all the time I have walked this public life journey have you ever expressed frustration or shown doubt. You have unstintingly backed me 100 per cent. I love you deeply and am endlessly grateful to have you in my life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other blessing Gino brought to me was a beautiful step-daughter, Ellie, and my in-laws, Alex, who we don't have with us any longer, and my lovely mother-in-law, Enza. Now in my life I also have Ellie, her partner Nick and the absolute joy of my life, my grandchildren—Anton, who is nine and who is very upset at not being able to boast about who his nana is for much longer, and Sienna, who is four. Now, my little loves, you won't have to video call me and ask, 'When do you get back from Canberra, Nana?'</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I would like to start by acknowledging all the men and women around the nation who have worn the uniform or continue to wear the uniform in service to this nation, and I want to acknowledge their families, who are the backbone of the defence community. Our soldiers know their mission remains fixed: determined, unbreakable, it is to win our wars. Almost everything outside of our military career will not hold such gravity as this vital dedication and service to this nation. Our soldiers are the ones we look to to train, to fight. Their skill set is in the profession of arms; their will to win, the sure knowledge that there is no substitute for victory. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more than 31,000 defence personnel, veterans and their families living in Townsville. Townsville is a proud garrison city with a long military heritage. We have served the Australian people for many years, in many wars, through many natural disasters. We have had soldiers killed in action, wounded in combat, injured in training, and those that have died by suicide. Improving the wellbeing of veterans and their families should not just be words; it should be enshrined in all of us here, every day, to better support the people that have fought for our freedoms, our democracy, our way of life—the people that we put in harm's way to ensure that we can sleep safely and soundly in our beds at night. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I deployed to East Timor and Afghanistan. I witnessed firsthand the commitment and dedication of the men and women of our armed forces—commitment and dedication on the battlefield, which is difficult for the community who are left behind to see and fully understand. We built schools for girls, wells for community; we fought the enemy. Just recently we had our soldiers from Townsville—from the First Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, my former unit—in Afghanistan on an extremely dangerous rescue mission. Our brave men and women answered the nation's call to go into harm's way, where the rule of law has failed, and to rescue people that helped us in Afghanistan. This mission was like no other. We haven't seen an operation of this magnitude for a very long time. They did a fantastic job and an honourable job. We as a grateful nation owe a great debt to our soldiers. We have also seen just recently soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, based in Townsville deployed to the Solomon Islands to help the people of the Solomon Islands during civil unrest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the best times of my life were in the Defence Force, and also some of the hardest challenges I've faced were when I was transitioned out. Our defence family, whether we served together or just share that experience, are people that I call family—people I represent here in this place and people who look to me to ensure their voices are heard. For those who have been injured from their service, we must do better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Exempting Disability Payments from Income Testing and Other Measures) Bill 2021 does a small bit in doing better. This bill implements the recommendations of the review by Mr David Tune. This bill will allow veterans on this compensation to access housing assistance, which they hadn't been able to do before. These provisions are to remove the means test imposed on rent assistance for certain veterans and dependants. Many will now be eligible for rent assistance or an increased rate of rent assistance. It is to our nation's shame that veterans would be homeless, sleeping rough or not able to get rent assistance. So this bill goes an extra step in the right direction to ensure that the people we in this place call on to do our bidding can get the supports that they deserve. Rent assistance is a supplementary payment to the service pension, income support supplement and veteran payment recipients who pay private rent that exceeds a certain threshold. Disability pension and permanent impairment payment recipients have these compensation payments taken into account in the calculation of any rent assistance paid with the service pension, income support pension or veteran payment. These disability compensation payments can reduce the rent assistance payable if an individual's compensation payment rate exceeds a certain threshold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill simplifies the absolute complexity of what people have to go through. This is to really streamline things and make it easier for our service personnel and our veterans to get the help they need. It is clunky. The opposition agree. We on this side agree. This has been clunky for a long time, and it has been complex. This bill is to help streamline the processes for our soldiers and our veterans, the ones who could be overseas right now, who one day may fall on hard times and need assistance through rent assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also includes a measure to implement a two-year trial of non-liability rehabilitation. This will enable veterans participating in the trial to access DVA rehabilitation services earlier, without the need to make a claim for compensation or await a determination of liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes relating to disability compensation payments will cost $33.3 million. Who cares, to be honest? There is no figure or number that needs to be thrown around when we are talking about supporting our veterans and our soldiers. When it comes to supporting those who support us through wars, from wars before my time, before I was born, to ones I have been involved in to ones that could potentially happen in the future, there is no number.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this bill is to exempt certain disability pensions paid under the VEA, the Veterans' Entitlement Act, and the MRCA, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, from the social security income test. Removing an income test that applies to rent assistance paid to some veterans' disability pension receipts will allow those receiving higher rates of disability compensation to receive higher rent assistance. There are changes to references to 'disability pension' in the VEA to the term 'pensions by the way of compensation to veterans and their dependants'. You can already see where we're going here. This is clunky, right? So streamlining this will make it a lot easier for veterans who are looking at this bill to understand it and to understand what they're entitled to. It will also help the department and the states that we'll be working with to really understand it. Not everyone's a veteran, not everyone has served, and not everyone fully understands the difference between when we're talking about compensation and when we're talking about pensions. This makes it a little bit easier. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think establishing the pilot program, or the trial, is a good step in the right direction, but I'd like to see that trial become fixed. Once again, I don't want to see a trial happen and then us try and wind anything back. I think we should be opening the gamut of services to our bravest. The people that put on the uniform, our brave men and women, do it every day. And you hear stories—not just overseas but inside Australia—like when the floods happened in Townsville and soldiers' houses were flooded. They didn't even go to their houses to remove their stuff, because they were too busy helping someone else down the road. It's a selfless sacrifice to your community and to your nation, to always put someone else first and the community first. This bill is about putting our people first, the ones we ask to go into harm's way—the ones we ask to go to where the cyclone is and clean up, the ones we ask to go and help out with COVID-19 Assist, the ones we ask to go and help out with floods and natural disasters. This is about supporting our soldiers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that I'll leave on, and I'll depart on here, is that it's okay not to be okay. It's okay to have a bad day, it's okay to have a mental illness, but it's not okay to suffer in silence. We must change how we view and how we speak and how we act when it comes to mental wellbeing, when it comes to mental illness, when it comes to suicide prevention and stigma. We must, in this place, be leaders in that. Debating, and going back and forward, is not what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is having the courage to stand up and support each other when the bad times happen. We all have them here. We all miss our families; we've all had lockdowns, like our communities have. But we, in this place, need to be the change agents and be leaders in our community, and say, 'It's okay if you're not travelling okay, but you must speak to someone. You must.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an ever-changing world and we have high rates of suicide in the veterans community, but I want to see leaders in this place work together to ensure that the stigma is gone. Stand up, put your hand up, if you're not tracking well. That's cool; there are places where you can get help. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to support our Australian veterans. From the outset I will say that Labor will not oppose this legislation, as it will improve assistance currently available to many disabled veterans. The parliament owes a duty to the men and women who serve our country in uniform. These Australians place themselves in the path of danger so the rest of us don't need to. They make immense sacrifices so that we can all live a safer life. Owing to the significance of the sacrifices they have made, we must ensure that our care for service men and women extends beyond their time in uniform. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill aims to simplify and better target support for the most severely impaired veterans. This bill is in response to a review of the TPI payment conducted by Mr David Tune. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, Mr Tune was commissioned by the Prime Minister on the eve of the 2019 election to review the TPI payment. In his investigation, Mr Tune highlighted the disadvantage faced by many TPI veterans in private rental arrangements. The bill implements the recommendations from the Tune review and will simplify the payments and related administrative arrangements for veterans. It will do a number of things to increase the support provided to severely impaired veterans. It will remove the disability income rent test under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and allow some TPI veterans on low incomes in private rental accommodation to become eligible for Commonwealth rent assistance or receive a higher rate of CRA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also exempts the disability pension from the Social Security Act. This means that the existing Defence Force Income Support Allowance top-up payment can be abolished, as it's no longer deemed to be necessary. The bill will also combine separate indexation components for the extreme disablement pension adjustment and the intermediate rate of special rate pensions, the TPI payment, into one from September 2022 and establish a two-year non-liability rehabilitation pilot program in response to a PC review recommendation. Importantly, this bill will also rename the disability pension to the disability compensation payment. That clarifies that the pension is not an income support pension or welfare, a term the government likes to use, but a compensation payment—an acknowledgement, if you like, of the service that these men and women have provided that led to their impairment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst these changes are undoubtably important and will provide some benefit to the severely impaired veterans who they affect, we cannot pretend that this bill is enough. The government has been dragged kicking and screaming to many of the reforms presented in this bill. The Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex Servicemen and Women was dismayed by the government's response to the Tune review. In particular, the measures to extend rent assistance were criticised by stakeholders, as they were estimated to only benefit around 10 per cent of TPI veterans. The TPI Federation has advocated for an increase in the TPI payment of around $10,000 a year for all TPI veterans in order to provide adequate assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the rent assistance measure was originally scheduled to commence on September 2022. However, following pressure from Labor and the TPI Federation, the government backflipped and brought this forward to January 2022. It's important that they've done that. In response to the TPI Federation's concerns about the Tune review, this year Labor initiated a Senate inquiry into the adequacy of the TPI payment. That recommended an increase in the payment. However, in its response tabled on 7 October this year, the government ignored the recommendation and instead opted to do nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the government is not fully committed to providing the necessary support to severely impaired veterans. Whilst the changes in this bill are based on common sense, it's disappointing that the government has taken this long to implement them. The bill that has been proposed by the government reeks of tokenism. Labor will not oppose the bill. It's supported by Labor and stakeholders, as some change is better than none. We are not going to be the ones who put average aside because we seek perfection. We can't stop here. What we need to do is actually get the government to stop playing tokenism with veterans. Do the right thing; they deserve it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Labor government will seek to implement real and meaningful changes to the way in which we as a country support severely impaired veterans. An Albanese Labor government will offer more than the half-baked tokenism that's been put forward in this bill. As I said, we're not going to oppose this legislation, as it will improve and streamline assistance to veterans and improve their wellbeing. However, we know it is not what TPI veterans want. We know that what they want is a proper increase in the payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do, however, condemn the Morrison government for their failure to accept the recommendation of the Senate inquiry that the TPI payment be increased. Such an increase would ensure our most disabled veterans are not left behind, something you'd think would be so important to every member of this chamber and the other place. For years, stakeholders have been arguing for an increase to the TPI payment. The government's response to a bipartisan inquiry was a slap in the face for Australia's 27,000 TPI veterans. It just goes to show that this is a government that's all about announcement; when it comes to delivery, they run and hide. This has a big impact for Australian veterans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is most disappointing is that before the 2019 election, the Prime Minister effectively promised to increase the payment, but since then he has deliberately and wilfully ignored the pleas of TPI veterans—and his own colleagues' advice—and failed to deliver on that. It is a pattern that Australians have become used to—all announcement, no delivery—except this time it's really impacting the people that this government say they care so much about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After sitting on this review of the TPI payment for more than a year, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced in last year's budget that he would only provide rent assistance to a small proportion of TPI veterans. That means most veterans will miss out. We're not going to stand in the way of this legislation, but, along with many TPI veterans, we believe these tokenistic measures are not good enough, and our veterans and their families deserve much better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at this bill it's clear that only Labor is truly on the side of Australian ex-service men and women. It's clear that the Morrison government is only interested in its own image. The modest reforms put forth in this bill do not provide the necessary assistance to veterans and their families. All Australians deserve more than the Morrison government, especially our veterans. These men and women have made and continue to make immense sacrifices for our country, and they deserve full and unconditional support—not only those who have been in wars past but those who are going to be in the chapters of war that we face into the future. It's time we got things right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Something I'm very, very passionate about is supporting our veterans. I think back to many times when we've had absolutely horrid discussions with DVA, and now we can't even get a response from the laziest minister that God ever put wind into. We need to have veterans looked after properly, efficiently and correctly. This bill that we see today before the House will simplify and streamline assistance to veterans and improve their wellbeing. It is better than nothing. I'm sorry that it is only a little bit, but we will continue to push and to support our veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make it very clear: the Morrison government should not construe the support of this side of the House as validation of the pitiful efforts they have provided veterans. Veterans and their families have not been a priority of this government. Only Labor is on the side of Australian veterans and their families. We know what they've been through, and we know what they deserve. They deserve not to be cast aside by this government. As I said, we will not oppose this bill, but the government should be on notice that we are not going to continue to allow them to make tokenistic gestures to our veterans in their time of most need and that we will continue to support them to get everything that they truly have earned and deserve.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="MT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  Thank you for this opportunity to address the parliament on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Exempting Disability Payments from Income Testing and Other Measures) Bill 2021. Every now and again there is a moment in the parliament that should not be missed, where history is made, where a change comes, and we as parliamentarians need to note it. With the retirement of the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, our last connection to Old Parliament House will be severed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Warren Snowdon was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs from 2010 to September 2013. He achieved two things I would like to acknowledge, amongst many other achievements. He moved the veterans' affairs equivalent of Five Eyes from officer level up to ministerial level, so the issues were acknowledged as far more important than the parliaments of the day were recognising. Subsequently, the second ministerial meeting was held here in Canberra, and that was Warren's work. From 2010 to 2012, Warren focused on the eminent persons group to start planning the Gallipoli event of 2015. He knew that they had to look ahead and they had to be three years out to make this event the very important event that it was. To his credit, the member for Lingiari understood the value of relationships. To underpin such important work he twice visited Turkey and France. His foresight in dealing with the mayor of the province of Villers-Bretonneux was seen when he happened to have a signed Wallabies jumper at hand to give as a gift to the mayor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to home, according to Warren's return speech, Warren wondered if having a child at the height of his 2013 campaign would grab the granny vote and some of the women's vote. I have heard since, though, that the women of his area rallied and put out the cry 'Support Elizabeth; vote Warren go back to Canberra'! He did return, and his list of parliamentary achievements is two A4 pages of tiny writing, so I won't even try to go through all the work that he's done in the parliament, but I would like to highlight some things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August 2013 he launched the online suicide prevention and mental health resource Operation Life online. In June 2013 he improved military compensation arrangements in response to the 2011 review of military compensation changes to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, including increased permanent impairment compensation and DVA white cards for former ADF members with long-term health conditions accepted under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. He increased the compensation for dependent children of deceased ADF members. In May of 2013, the DVA Veteran Mental Health Strategy was launched, with proposed extended arrangements allowing access to mental health supports—here we go again—and supports prior to compensation claims post discharge and GP assessments. It also extended the veterans and veterans families counselling service to those with certain peacetime service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In May 2012, funding was announced for the Anzac centenary commemorative program to run from 2014 all the way through to 2018. In May and June of 2012, the government provided assistance to Bomber Command veterans travelling to London for the dedication of the new Bomber Command Memorial on 28 June 2012. In February of 2012, the first national observance of the bombing of Darwin was held on the 70th anniversary. In December 2011, Australian personnel involved in maintenance, transport or decontamination of aircraft used in the British nuclear testing program became eligible for cancer testing and treatment. In September 2011, the prisoner of war recognition supplement was introduced. It was paid to veterans who were prisoners of war and to civilian detainees. It was paid at the rate of $500 per fortnight and indexed in line with the CPI. It was not income for income tax purposes or for the purposes of social security or veterans entitlements income checks. In May of 2011, the Coordinated Veterans' Care Program was introduced to provide ongoing planned and coordinated primary and community care for gold card holders who have chronic conditions and complex care needs and are at risk of unplanned hospitalisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sharon Bird just gave her valedictory speech, and I've heard the member for Lingiari speak to the parliament. In March 2011, he released a military compensation review, a review of the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2004; and, in 2010, members of the Australian Protective Service who patrolled the Maralinga site up to June 1998 became eligible for cancer testing and treatment. He has the serious dedication around mental health and condition of the community that veterans' affairs ministers become a part of—part of their family. For all his hard work, Warren is to be congratulated. The parliament is better for it. Having said that, I will refer to his first speech in just a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The era that Warren first joined the parliament in—the Old Parliament House—was totally different to the expanses of this Parliament House. Everybody was connected together in a very small group of people—it's only what I've been told—and so the interaction between members, staff, ministers and backbenchers was fierce and unrelenting for the whole of the time they were there. COVID has had us so disconnected in this House with the social distancing and all the measures that we have had to deal with, whereas the old House was a very small unit, and the interaction of parliamentarians then was quite different to what it is today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have someone coming from that era still here in 2021 and having suffered a loss. I identify with the member for Lingiari, because I have been a 'oncer' in this place twice, and I know how hard it is to come back. I know how hard it is to stay here in a marginal seat, like the member for Lingiari. There are many people—I'm sure the member for Lingiari won't talk about them—who would be very happy if he weren't in this place or if he had been booted out long ago. You've got to fight for your position, you've got to fight to stay here, it's hard to come in, it's difficult when you are in here and it's very easy to be thrown out. So you've got to be a dedicated parliamentarian and have a commitment to the people that you serve, the people of this nation, the party you represent, the caucus you are a part of and this House of Representatives—this place where the decisions for the nation are taken. It's a privilege for all of us to be a part of that decision-making process for the nation in good times and bad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lingiari said in his first speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This nation cannot pretend to wear the mantle of maturity until the indigenous rights of Aboriginal Australians are given formal recognition and the demands by Aboriginal and Islander people for compensation for lands stolen and for social and cultural disruption are addressed. In my view, this should involve appropriate amendments to the Constitution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the member for Lingiari: we stand here today, you and I, in unison on that need to change the Constitution and recognise the importance of the Indigenous people in this nation. Further, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Until we give back to the black man just a bit of the land that was his, without strings to snatch it back, without anything but complete generosity of spirit in concession for the evil we have done him—until we do that, we will remain what we have always been so far, a people without integrity; not a nation by a community of thieves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pretty strong words for a first speech in this place! But those words were written and spoken by someone who had a clear sense of responsibility of representation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish the member for Lingiari and all who travel with him, his family and friends, the very best in his retirement. May you go well and may the sunsets of the Northern Territory be a part of your days.</span>

I'm highly embarrassed by those wonderful words, and I thank the member for Monash for that wonderful contribution. I had prepared a speech about veterans affairs, which I probably won't use, but I just want to say to the member for Monash and other members in this place that I'm not on my own here. Right across this parliament, on both sides, from all quarters, we have people of commitment and people of character, some of whom we agree with some of the time and some of whom we disagree with all of the time, but what we can be assured of is that, by and large, their motivation is for public service and to represent their communities in the best possible way. I'm not sure whether I'll give a valedictory. I may, but I'm not quite sure how I would address the words of the member for Monash in a way that could do him justice. There was no need for you to make that contribution in the way you did, and I'm very, very grateful. Thank you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will reflect for a moment on what it was to be Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. I was given what was, I think, a great responsibility but a wonderful opportunity, an opportunity to meet and be part of a broad defence and veterans family. My father had been a serviceman and was TPI. His father and his father's brothers, five of them, went to the First World War. My father's brother went to the Second World War. My uncles went to the war. So we had a tradition of service. I was in the Citizen Military Forces, a cut-lunch soldier, for a few years. So to be given the awesome responsibility of being Minister for Veterans' Affairs was a huge privilege and a dreadfully great honour. What I found was that, by and large, when we worked across the chamber on issues which related to veterans there was very little difference in approach. Michael Ronaldson, as you'll recall, was the shadow minister for a period. It was a privilege to be part of that family and to understand the needs and wants of veterans, understand their service, understand the difficulties they and their families confronted as a result of their service, and understand our nation's obligation to accept responsibility for those people as veterans from the day that walked into Kapooka. The day that they sign on is the date that we sign up to look after their interests for the rest of their life. That doesn't mean we have to be sitting on their shoulders, but clearly, as we've seen, particularly after a very intense period of war in the Middle East and Afghanistan, we've hurt people. We as a nation have a responsibility to make sure that those people are given every opportunity to heal. I commend the government for the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. I think it's very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I talked briefly about the privilege of being a minister. I mentioned Villers-Bretonneux; the privilege of giving the Anzac morning address at Gallipoli or V-B; and being involved in the identification of a mass grave at Fromelles. Working with the French and British governments for the exhumation and then the identification of those First World War heroes and then having them buried in a dedicated war service gravesite at Fromelles was really very important. It could not have been done without the tireless work of the Department of Defence's Army History Unit and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Similarly, I accompanied some old special forces soldiers, who had served in Vietnam, to Hanoi. The purpose of this trip was to receive the remains of the last Australian soldier missing in action, Private Fisher, and we were able to accompany him home. That was an enormous privilege and a great honour, and I think it helps me, at least, come to terms with the reality of war: sacrifice, comradeship, struggle, hardship, and the need for us to forever recognise that the hardship, the struggle and the sacrifice are borne not only by those soldiers themselves but by their families.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when we look at this legislation, we use just one marker: how does it make life better for someone? To me, it appears that this type of legislation that we are talking about today will make life easier. We will have our differences about the issues of the TPI Federation and their requests for more resources, and we can have those discussions, but what we have to do is agree that across the parliament we have but one responsibility: to look after them and to make sure they get the best opportunity and the best service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think my comrade next to me may know the figure, but I think we've had in excess of 40,000 soldiers, sailors and air men and women serve in our longest war. When I finished as a minister in 2013, we were only halfway through. We have the issues which have emerged now and which are the subject of the royal commission, and we have an enormous responsibility to address those issues. But I have to say that the motivation of those people who are servants of the community in the Department of Veterans' Affairs should really be understood. They do their utmost, given the restrictions we place upon them, to do the best they possibly can for veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I have spent very little time talking about the legislation, but, having felt quite embarrassed, I thought I should respond in some way. I again thank the member for Monash. Member for Monash, as I said in a contribution earlier today about you, I hope you will reconsider your thoughts about walking away from the chair of the Privileges Committee. It's very important that you stay there, and I know that's a feeling which is shared across the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker, I won't take up any more of your time. Thank you very much.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Exempting Disability Payments from Income Testing and Other Measures) Bill 2021. I want to join the member for Monash in reminding all honourable members of this House that we are indeed, as this parliament draws to a close, at a special and particular time in the history of this parliament, with the member for Lingiari leaving. I was reminded of his father yesterday, who served in the independent companies in World War II, with the passing of Jim Ellwood. Jim was the last veteran from the island of Timor, during World War II. He served with the 4th Independent Company. From this, we remember a couple of things. One is that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is providing services not only to veterans of the Second World War but, through the generations to the current day, to a young Australian soldier, sailor or aviator who is injured, who would need some support, who is in service as we speak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank my friend the member for Lingiari for all those veterans' lives he made better during his service as the veterans affairs minister. Whether it was here in Australia or overseas, he represented us with distinction. I know so many people whose lives he made better because of his work with the department and because of the ex-service organisations getting good results. I will mention one person from my electorate. He is someone who is a big character in the Northern Territory who served with the Department of Defence, in Maralinga. He was left to cover all his own medical bills as he fought cancer and had different procedures. To receive that acknowledgement, and that gold card, made all the difference to him. Thanks, Woz, for all you did for the veterans community and all those families. I support that sentiment 100 per cent—that making life better for our veterans and their families is the focus, and that that should never be lost in the back and forth of this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say upfront that I support the intent of this bill, and Labor is supporting it. Later I will make some comments about a veteran that I want to bring to the attention of the minister and the House. I am glad the government has responded to the calls of veterans and their families, and of federal Labor, to implement the measures that were first announced in the 2020-21 budget and were due to commence in September this year. That time frame, as I understand it, has been brought forward. In particular, around rent assistance, key elements of the measure contained in this bill will commence on 1 January next year. This is positive news. Labor is of course supporting them, particularly as there is some urgency to get this legislation passed so that they can start on 1 January. I won't take my whole 15 minutes, so that we're able to crack on with the work that needs to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Lingiari mentioned, there are those who have been speaking out loudly. Of course TPI veterans would prefer an increase in the TPI payment, and the TPI Federation has been campaigning for that. The Prime Minister did commission the Tune review just before the last election, and I hope that he hasn't raised the TPI Federation's expectations about an increase in that payment by telling them they had a compelling case, without being willing to follow through with that. I guess we'll see in the coming months. Some TPIs have obviously seen it as a breach of trust, seeing that their wishes have been ignored, but it is why Labor—in its desire to make sure that our veterans do have the government held accountable—set up an independent Senate inquiry. That inquiry found that the TPI Federation did make a compelling case and recommended an increase in the TPI payment. I would point those opposite to the comments of even some of their own members such as former General Jim Molan, who's also supporting the TPI case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, we heard in Senate estimates recently that the department is struggling to deal with a huge backlog of veterans' claims, with 68 per cent of disability pension claims yet to be finalised as of April this year. I can tell you that a wife of a currently serving member has contacted me—and I'll be writing to the minister—to say that, after in excess of 530 days, he still hasn't had someone allocated to his case and he is, obviously, still waiting for a determination as he transitions. That period of transition is really important. I think we're going to hear out of the royal commission story after story about how some of our veterans have declined in terms of their mental health through the long periods of waiting. Let me make it clear, though, when I say this I'm not taking anything away from the passion and hard work of the employees of the Department of Veterans' Affairs—not at all. But governments make decisions about resource allocation, and, obviously, what needs to happen is that resources are allocated so that we're dealing with these cases of our veterans much more quickly than we currently are and there's more support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chair of the royal commission has also called out the government for pre-empting and duplicating the work and recommendations of the royal commission with this latest review that's been talked about recently, with McKinsey, so I just encourage the minister to ensure that we're not duplicating effort and we're not retraumatising. And, as I did in the other chamber just a little while ago, I call on the minister and the government to make sure that there are 24-hour human resources, mental health resources and counsellors for those families and veterans involved in the royal commission to access. Often we find that after hours is when the black dog can visit, so I think it's important during these hearings that there is 24-hour care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, Labor supports this legislation. We do believe that our veterans and their families deserve the best support. I want to, again, thank all of those who are working on this very important royal commission, because it will, I'm sure, identify trends where those patriotic men and women of the Defence Force fall through the cracks and identify how that has happened so that we can, in a systematic way, make those changes that mean that we will give them what the member for Lingiari said during his speech, which is: through what we do, make life better for our veterans and their families.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to be able to rise to speak to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Exempting Disability Payments from Income Testing and Other Measures) Bill 2021 this evening, although I do seek indulgence just to reflect on some of the contributions made by previous speakers and, particularly, my friends the member for Monash, the member for Lingiari and the member for Solomon. I want to particularly, this being perhaps the last time I'll get to speak on a bill with my dear friend and colleague the member for Lingiari, acknowledge his exceptional service and work for the veteran community. I really appreciated the speeches beforehand. I have often worked with the member for Lingiari on a lot of First Nations issues, learning from him. When I have travelled with him throughout Australia when we have been doing committee work, his knowledge of defence and the area of veterans affairs in particular has been second to none. People everywhere have acknowledged that. He is so exceptionally well known. I think that those three years from 2010 to 2013 when he was Minister for Veterans' Affairs really cemented his legacy in this area. It is a legacy that is immense, and I for one really appreciate that—and I know many other colleagues in this parliament do too. I have been in denial for some time that he is in fact retiring. I find it hard to believe. But I did not want this evening to pass without acknowledging his extraordinary work, to thank him for that and to acknowledge that legacy. It's one that he should be immensely proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is very much on the side of Australian veterans and their families, and that's why we will be supporting this legislation this evening. This simplifies and streamlines assistance to veterans and will improve their wellbeing, and nobody in this place would be opposed to that. The bill addresses recommendations made by Mr David Tune AO PSM in his 2019 review of the totally and permanently incapacitated payment, the TPI payment. The government's had the Tune review's recommendations and the Productivity Commission's 2019 report on a better way to support veterans. I am a little disappointed that it is 2021. Both those reviews are a couple of years old now. Sometimes the wheels in government move slowly, and this is very much one of those examples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government first announced these measures that we are seeing in the bill tonight back in the 2020-21 budget, and its intention to bring forward these important changes from 20 September to 1 January 2022 was flagged in last year's budget. That was following immense pressure from TPI veterans, with the support of the Australian Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms will simplify the administration of some payments for veterans and their dependants. This will be done by exempting disability payments from income testing under the Social Security Act 1991. It will simplify arrangements for some 14,000 veterans and their dependants. That's a good thing. The government will also increase access to rent assistance for our most disabled veterans. This will benefit some 6,900 veterans and their dependants. Specifically, the first schedule will implement the government's commitment to exempt the adjusted disability pension, defined in the Veterans' Entitlements Act, from the income test under the Social Security Act. These are important changes. This will remove the need for the Defence Force Income Support Allowance, or DFISA. Introduced in 2004, that allowance was paid as a top-up to ensure that veterans who received an age pension under the Social Security Act were not financially disadvantaged. Changes in this schedule will ensure veterans will receive the same payment as before but administrative processes will be much simpler. While it's an administrative change, this will make the allowance redundant, and this bill will remove all relevant references to that from the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second schedule will remove the disability income rent test from under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. That will mean disabled veterans will now have access to the same rent assistance as those who receive it via Centrelink. It'll increase rent assistance payable to veterans or enable some disabled veterans to receive rent assistance for the first time, and that is important. The disability income rent test results in severely disabled veterans receiving less rent assistance than those with a lower-level disability. In particular, this measure will benefit totally and permanently incapacitated veterans, who presently do not receive any rent assistance due to the amount of compensation they receive. That's been a gross inequity for some time. Schedule 4 will remove references to the term 'disability pension' in the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this legislation. As I said, it'll improve and streamline the assistance that we can deliver to veterans and ultimately improve their wellbeing. However, we know it's not what most TPI veterans wanted. The reality is that most actually want an increase in the actual TPI payment. The Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex Servicemen and Women, the TPI Federation, has been raising this issue about the inadequacies of the TPI payment for many years now. But the government has continued to ignore those concerns. Labor referred the issue of the adequacy of the TPI payment to a Senate inquiry earlier this year so that TPI veterans could have their say, have a direct line to lawmakers of this country, to tell them of their lived experience of this payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the TPI payment reported on 1 July this year and recommended that the government consider an increase in the payment. At the time, Labor called on the government to respond to the committee's unanimous recommendation. So this wasn't just Labor's call here; this was a recommendation backed by government members on the committee. We asked that the government respond to that unanimous recommendation, which would ensure that most disabled veterans would not be left behind. Surely, that is a good thing. Surely, that is something this government would want to support. However, in its response to the inquiry, which the government tabled on 7 October, all that the Morrison-Joyce government could say was that it noted that recommendation and would take it into account when considering future policy options for the support for TPI veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That turned out to be a very huge slap in the face of the 879 TPI veterans in the Newcastle and Hunter Region, and it just goes to show that this is a government that is still all about the announcement but not actually coming through on delivery. This makes Australian veterans very nervous. It was another blow for those long-suffering ex-service men and women who have long advocated for this important change to be made to remedy the existing inadequacy of the TPI payment. Before the 2019 election the Prime Minister totally raised the hopes of everybody at the TPI Federation when he said that he wanted to increase the payment and he was going to do that by commissioning this Tune review. But then he dashes all of their hopes post-election with this very flawed response to the review that we now have before us. After sitting on the report for more than a year—again, another pattern very common in this government now—the Prime Minister announced in last year's budget that he would only provide rent assistance to a very small portion of those TPI veterans, perhaps around 25 per cent, leaving most disgusted because they were going to miss out. In response to Labor's questions in Senate estimates last year it was revealed that these benefits would not start to flow until September 2022—September next year—while the government made changes to the legislation and various IT systems that needed changing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, following pressure from Labor and those TPI veterans who turned up again to try and be strong advocates for the people they're representing, the government brought forward those measures in this bill now to January 2022. But they're cutting it very fine to get them passed. We are just knocking on the door of December now and the government wants these in place in January. So Labor is not going to stand in the way of these measures because we want to see at least some assistance being delivered, however modest or indeed tokenistic it might seem to some TPI veterans, and who can blame them for that assessment? We don't want to get in the way of this very modest form of assistance for those most deserving former Defence personnel. But we do condemn the Morrison Liberal government for its failure to accept the recommendation of a Senate inquiry and its appalling treatment of TPI veterans over the past eight years. I would acknowledge that there are some government members who are trying to advocate for this matter, and I say all power to you, but we've not seen any actual response from the government that is going to really cut it for the TPI veterans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a Department of Veterans' Affairs that's struggling with a huge backlog of TPI pension claims. It's really just not good enough that our veterans and their families are having to, first, be disappointed with inaction, and, second, be confronted with a department that is probably not resourced enough, I don't think, to be able to actually get through some of the claims that it has in its system. I note on that matter that ex-service men and women in my community are still very concerned about the VAN office in Newcastle. I want to thank my local veteran community for their very strong advocacy. The last few months have been very tough on veterans, with the cancellation of local Anzac services; the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which was really triggering for many, many Defence ex-service men and women; and of course the release of the Brereton report. I think that's why it is critical that this Morrison government reopens the VAN office in Newcastle, which still remains closed, as a matter of priority. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs should be reassuring local veterans in my community that this government will not be making any moves to close that VAN office permanently because that is what is worrying veterans right now. I won't stop fighting for this issue. It is the very least we can do to honour those who serve us, to ensure that they have a place to come and be treated with dignity and have their concerns addressed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of our ex-service organisations in Newcastle generally. As I said, it's been another really tough year for veterans. I want to give my personal thanks to the TPI Association at Wallsend; the Newcastle and Hunter Region Vietnam Veterans; the RSL sub-Branches of the City of Newcastle, Merewether-Hamilton-Adamstown, Lambton-New Lambton, Wallsend and District, Shortland, Waratah-Mayfield-Islington and Stockton. I know the work you do each and every day to honour those who you have lost and to care for those who remain, and I do want to put on record my thanks. I also want to acknowledge the Hunter Anzac Memorial Ltd; the RSL Coffee Pot Day Club in Merewether; the WRANS Naval Women's Association, Hunter Region; the Gallipoli Legion Club Preservation Group; the Newcastle War Widows Guild Club; the Wallsend Diggers; the RAAF Association; the City of Newcastle Anzac Day Committee; Newcastle Legacy; the Newcastle branch of the National Service and Combined Forces Association of Australia Inc; the Naval Association of Australia; Newcastle N16; Open Arms Veterans and Families Counselling; and the many other service organisations which do their utmost every day to honour those who have served. It's been an especially challenging year for everyone. I certainly hope that 2022 is much kinder to you all. Take care, and best wishes. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  Labor is on the side of Australian veterans and their families. That is why I and Labor will support this legislation that will simplify and streamline assistance to veterans. This will improve their wellbeing. Life has been made far too difficult for veterans and their families—individuals who have put their lives and wellbeing on the line in the interests of our nation. It is up to us to support them following their service. That's not something that has been adequate to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Exempting Disability Payments from Income Testing and Other Measures) Bill 2021 addresses recommendations made by David Tune AO in his 2019 review of the totally and permanently incapacitated payment, or the Tune review, as well as the Productivity Commission's 2019 report <span style="font-style:italic;">A better way to support veterans</span>. These reforms will simplify the administration of some payments for veterans and their dependants. This will be done by exempting disability payments from income testing under the Social Security Act, simplifying payment arrangements for 14,000 veterans and their dependants. This will remove the need for the defence force income support allowance, simplifying the administrative processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will also see increased access to rent assistance for our most disabled veterans—rent assistance that they have not been able to access at all before. This will benefit approximately 6,900 veterans and their dependants. This will mean that disabled veterans will now have access to the same rent assistance as those who receive Centrelink benefits. This will increase rent assistance payable to veterans and enable some disabled veterans to receive rent assistance for the first time. In particular, this measurement will benefit totally and permanently incapacitated veterans who presently do not receive any rent assistance due to the amount of compensation that they receive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third schedule in this bill will remove references to the term 'disability pension' in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. In future, this payment will be referred to as the disability compensation payment. This change will clarify that these payments are compensation and will reduce the potential for the payment to be confused with Services Australia's disability support pensions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill's fourth schedule will streamline indexation for disability pension compensation. Currently, the extreme disablement adjustment intermediate rate and special rate pensions, colloquially known as the TPI payment, are split into two components for indexation purposes. This legislation will remove this anomaly so that the whole amount is indexed as one. As an aside, this is but one of many anomalies that currently exist between the Veterans' Entitlements Act, the MRCA and the DRCA, but it is good to at least get this one resolved. Overall, this will simplify DVA legislation, policy and procedures. It will help avoid confusion for veterans about the purpose and structure of the extreme disablement adjustment intermediate and special rates of disability pensions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth schedule in the bill introduces a pilot program for earlier access to rehabilitation. This non-liability rehabilitation pilot will enable individuals to commence DVA funded rehabilitation before a liability decision has been made under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act or the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act. Under these amendments, a two-year pilot will be established to bridge the gap and enable veterans to start their rehabilitation program sooner. This will improve and streamline the assistance that is provided to veterans whilst they are awaiting a liability decision, which can take some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the reality is, most veterans are looking for a TPI payment increase. The government has completely ignored concerns made by the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex Service Men and Women, as well as those of the Disabled Veterans of Australia Network, both of which have been raising the issue of the TPI payment level for many, many years—indeed, quite directly to me over my entire time in this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This led to the establishment of a Senate inquiry earlier this year. The Senate committee included both government and Labor senators as well as Independent Senator Jacqui Lambie, and its report was adopted unanimously. The committee found that submitters made a persuasive case for a fair and just structural increase in the above general rate component of the TPI payment to help restore the relative value of the payment and recognise and replace TPI veterans' loss of income. In fact, the committee noted correspondence from the Prime Minister, sent to the TPI Federation, where he said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The TPI Federation makes a compelling case in relation to the relative value of the Above the General Rate (AGR) component of the SRDP [Special Rate of Disability Pension]. The fact that TPI veterans are not able to earn an income as a result of their service to our nation means that their loss of income during what would have been their working life should be appropriately recognised and replaced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, in a Senate estimates hearing on 26 October last year, the secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs conceded the Prime Minister's letter had raised expectations that the government would increase the TPI payment and the TPI Federation made a strong argument for an increase. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommended the government consider an increase to the TPI payment, with the government to consider the exact level of that increase. However, in response to this inquiry, the Morrison-Joyce government have merely 'noted' that recommendation. This is an absolute slap in the face to our 27,000 TPI veterans, veterans who are receiving less per annum than the minimum wage, veterans who quite rightly wonder why their service pension is reduced based on their partner's income, when, as recognised by a number of reviews, it is supposed to be an income replacement benefit for TPI veterans that is compensation consistent with insurance principles, not welfare. The means testing of this component of the payment against a spouse's income can be seen as a partial transfer of responsibility for paying such compensation from the Commonwealth to that veteran's partner or spouse. Before the 2019 election, the Prime Minister raised the hopes of veterans by commissioning a review into the TPI payment. It turns out that this was yet another announcement with no real delivery for our veterans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not stand in the way of these measures, as we want to see some assistance, however modest, for these most deserving former Defence personnel. We know that the Department of Veterans' Affairs, though, is struggling to deal with a huge backlog of TPI pension claims, with 68 per cent of claims yet to be finalised as of April this year. This has now prompted a fresh review of the claims processing system. It's just not good enough. Our veterans have given so much for us. They deserve to be treated better than this. Veterans in my community are very fortunate to have the support of the RSL in Gosnells, the Kelmscott RSL and the Armadale RSL, and I thank them and other service providers in my community for their service to our veterans. But the department and this government should and must do better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the House. </span>

This bill will implement the recommendations made by Mr David Tune in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview into th</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e TPI </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ayment</span> and the Productivity Commission's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">A better way to support veterans</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Tune's review particularly highlighted the disadvantage faced by TPI veterans in private rental arrangements. Presently, the disability income rent test results in severely disabled veterans receiving less rent assistance than those with a lower level of disability. To address this, the Australian government is abolishing the disability income rent test from the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Disabled veterans will now have access to the same rent assistance as those who receive it from Centrelink. This will increase rent assistance payable to veterans or enable some disabled veterans to receive rent assistance for the first time, benefiting approximately 6,900 veterans and their dependants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By exempting disability payments from being considered as income under the Social Security Act 1991, this bill simplifies the payment arrangements of 14,000 veterans and dependants. As part of the Australian government's response to the Productivity Commission's report, this bill will also implement a two-year trial to encourage and enable access to non-liability rehabilitation for 100 veterans for each year of the pilot. This will provide veterans earlier access to treatment without the need to make a claim for compensation or await a determination of liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving support for veterans remains an important piece of national work. This bill will make tangible improvements to the lives of our most incapacitated veterans, who served our country with distinction and gave their all. The Australian government remains committed to helping ensure that they get the support they deserve. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I begin this contribution on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 by saying that I know that many people on all sides of the House will have deep convictions and strongly held views about the specifics of this bill. This is my personal view that I express, and I obviously respect others who have a different view. In this bill I will be voting to support this legislation and this important reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial disease is a disease that is devastating for young children, devastating for parents and devastating for everyone who it touches. One in 200 people, or 120,000 Australians, carry the genetic change or specific genetic nature that potentially puts them at risk of developing mitochondrial disease or passing it on to their children. What this bill does is enable a regulatory arrangement so that IVF or an IVF-style treatment can be used to take the nuclear DNA from a patient's egg which contains the mitochondrial genetic aspect and then place it into a healthy donor egg. Every aspect of the DNA that makes us who we are, passed on by our mother, remains. This is a very, very specific change and very, very advanced technology that gives parents with this small genetic nuance a chance to have a healthy child. That's it. That's all it does. It gives them a chance to have a healthy child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of working as an adviser in the Victorian government during the voluntary assisted dying debate in Victoria, when the Victorian government and the Victorian parliament legislated voluntary assisted dying. What that bill did was set up a very specific arduous process for someone to go through that awful choice. It was complex legislation. It was very narrow, and it set up a precedent for a difficult yet important framework to facilitate a momentous societal change, and I think that this bill is no different. This bill is specific. It is complex. It is also done in a way that doesn't limit this parliament but reaches for a high standard of legislation to make specific changes to improve the lives of Australians. In this place, if we are not reaching for difficult legislation and if we are not reaching to solve complex issues for Australians, then we are lowering ourselves. This is not an easy issue, but it is my view that bills like this are actually what make this place incredibly important. When we reach to solve problems such as mitochondrial disease, it shines and serves us all well as parliamentarians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I'll say is that we, in this place, are truly blessed. We are blessed as people, as parents, as parliamentarians. Our lot in life, each of the 151 members of this place, is pretty darn good. We all have the full function available to us. We all can come into this place and stand up not only for ourselves but for the more than 100,000 people who elected us here. We've all been given a lot in life. That is something that I am extremely appreciative of and extremely grateful for. But the person whom this bill was named after, Maeve, wasn't. The families and the parents of people who carry the mitochondrial genetic nuance are given a much more difficult set of cards. To stand in this place and to give to those parents and to give to those families and, most importantly, to give to those future children that small improvement is a wonderfully generous gift that we could all give. I couldn't be prouder to stand in this place and say that I think we should all give it. I support this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maeve is five. She has a difficult journey ahead of her. She struggles to walk. She struggles to talk. This disease is taking away the very things that we all take for granted. She has older sisters, and her parents have shown immense courage in using her story in order to ensure that others don't have to go through the incredibly difficult and challenging journey that Maeve has to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say that I am proud to support this bill, that I am appreciative of all the things that I have been given, that I have a beautiful, healthy daughter who is able to live her life, and I hope she lives a long and prosperous and healthy and happy life. I hope that other Australian kids have the same opportunities that we all have and that we give this very, very small change to give them that chance.</span>

And I know that, most likely, I am on the losing side of the debate, but nonetheless the purpose of this chamber is for an examination and to announce a position and to give some cogent reason as to why you hold it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial disease and the effects of it—no-one is suggesting for one second what dire circumstances they are, and no-one is suggesting for one second that, obviously, a life better lived, with a better quality of life, is something we search for. But things must be seen through the prism of consequences and balance, and, for my part, I won't be supporting the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021. I say that at the start, and I do it for a number of reasons. One is that mitochondrial donation has been legal in the United Kingdom for nearly five years, but there have been no reported live births in the UK, so it's not clear if this procedure is safe and practical. Also, with the changing of the human genome, it has consequences that we really don't understand, and we don't understand it to the extent that the legislation emphasises this danger by giving immunity from civil liability for the adverse effects, and this removal of liability from both the minister and senior public servants states, in its very nature, that there is an uncertainty about exactly where this leads. If, as I and others have said, it is too dangerous for the decision-makers then it's probably something that requires absolute caution as to whether you proceed down that path. I suppose one of the core issues, of course, is that mitochondrial donation involves the creation and then the destruction of human embryos. And that's a philosophical divide—I respect other people's opinions, but it's something that is quite strongly held. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, to give reason to that, my explanation is: where, in a person's life, does another person have a greater right over it than themselves? And I cannot resolve myself to what that point is. If people pose the question, 'Is it the day before you were born?' then I think the vast majority of people say: 'No, that is not right. You can't terminate a life the day before it is born.' So we go on a journey and say, 'Maybe it's two days before,' and people say likewise. You say, 'Well, a week before.' Or is it at a point where it would be viable? Children, of course, can be born as early as 22 weeks and survive. How do you define the legal rights of one against the legal rights of the other? How do you get to a point where you say that, by reason of where the person is in their life, they have no rights, and then, at a certain point, a certain juncture, they do? I find trying to rationalise that point so often philosophically implausible, for my own part. I know other people have different views. Then there is the point of: Where do you go back to? How do you find that spot? What is the issue? Of course, people have varying views as to where the rights of the individual start and where they don't. If it's your capacity to look after yourself, then no child after they're born can look after themselves. No-one argues that they don't have rights. In fact, they probably aren't able to look after themselves until possibly as an early teenager, but there's not a parabola of rights where at certain ages through your life you have absolute rights and then they dwindle towards the end and they dwindle towards the start. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a view that it is a lineal position of rights and it's constant all the way through, and your capacity to comprehend your rights is merely that. If a person is asleep, they have no comprehension of their rights, but their rights nonetheless exist. If a person is knocked unconscious in an accident, they don't by doing so lose their rights. Have their rights in any way diminished? In fact, exceptional actions are taken to conserve the life and conserve their rights. So our actions in other parts of our life show, or other actions of any government show, that there is an absolute desire for the maintenance of life and the maintenance of the rights that exist for that life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the idea of liberty, of things that are attached to it, of liberalism, is a sense of attachment of a person's rights and protection of a person's rights and that a person has got to be allowed the capacity at some point to be master of their own ship, if so doing, and that what we should be doing is making sure that there are no impediments placed in the way of that person living the life that they wish to live. But, if a person's life is taken away from them, then of course they don't have any life at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do we find the point where we believe that someone's rights come into existence? I can't find that. So you go back and back and back. I arrive at the point that when there is conception, when there is the capacity for the human egg—go right back: add ovum to the egg—that after that point, once there is fertilisation, there is a process in train where what you are talking about is the development of the human person, but I believe that at that point is the establishment of rights and they must be respected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My main issue with this is the creation of that life for the known outcome, the deliberate outcome of knowing that there will be the destruction of that life. It wasn't an accident. It wasn't something that was not incurred; you actually create a life to destroy it, and I have a philosophical problem with that that goes beyond just a philosophical position, that actually divines how I am with this free vote—we're talking about our positions—how I can't discern a later stage where a person establishes a greater right, and neither has anybody ever been able to say to me they could clearly display or explain a later stage where a person becomes a part of those rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the complexion of this, of course, as always, is the issue of trying to deal with mitochondrial disease, with the mitochondrial defects, and, if that is not the solution, what is? We have an incredible capacity to develop the techniques into the future that are able to deal with this. We've had issues in the past, such as stem cell technology where it was implied that the only way was with embryonic stem cells, and it became apparent later that a vastly more apt process is stem cells that can be found in a person's own body, and this vastly reduces the capacity of rejection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With our intrusion into the process of the human genome, we must acknowledge that down the track there will be genetic inheritance of the changes that we have made. They may be of no consequence. They may be completely free of any detriment to generations that come after us. But we just don't know. We haven't been able to work that issue out. We haven't gone far enough into this. We are talking not only about the rights of the embryo that was destroyed but also about the rights of people down the track, in future generations, as to what will affect them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there's also another issue that is incredibly pertinent now, and we see that. A person has a right to understand what their genetics are and who their biological parents are. You can see it creates incredible hurt and frustration when people can't understand who they are. Everybody has an absolute desire to say, 'I know who supports me, who I was brought up with and who I call my mother and father,' whether they're biologically their mother or father or not, and they absolutely respect that. But the torment for many people is that they say, 'I don't know who my father is,' or, 'I don't know who my biological mother is; I don't know who that person is.' They live a life of searching for exactly what is the substance that makes them up and the essence of who they are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see that portrayed in so many things, where so many people go to certain sites to find out what their heritage is, to search through it, to see what makes them up and to see what their genetics actually go back to, what is the source and what is the point. With this, we are creating a genomic line that will make that impossible. There will be a point where even genetic testing will be inconclusive, because you've got a combination of genetic material that comes from three people, not from two. So, for subsequent generations of these people, what makes them will be of a vastly different complexion and a vastly greater complexity than for people who are making the decision today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So more needs to be done. I've tried to make sure that I didn't hide my philosophical view. It's clearly stated. I think that, on a lot of the issues which people worry about in this place, they say, 'I know you've got a view; you just don't say it.' Well, for the purpose of this, I have clearly stated my view. I note that there's been an agreement by the minister that sex selection is something that will not be supported, and I think that is a good thing, because inherently, once we do that, we start saying that one human being is of more value than another human being by reason of their gender. That, I think, is abhorrent to both sides of the chamber and is not accepted. That, in essence, also creates questions. People are thinking about this. It is not as simple and straightforward as it might first appear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the House for the opportunity to lay down a brief iteration of some of the concerns that I have and some form of reasoning as to why I hold them. For those reasons, I shan't be supporting this.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  'Mitochondrial disease' refers to a complex group of inherited conditions that can significantly lower an individual's health and life expectancy and that may be fatal. Mitochondrial disease is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA of an individual, which can impact the ability of that individual's mitochondria to function properly. The disease varies in presentation and severity, but common symptoms include developmental delays, seizures, weakness and fatigue, muscle pain, vision and hearing loss, multiple organ failure and heart problems, leading to morbidity and, in severe cases, premature death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 aims to enable procedures intended to prevent the inheritance of mutated mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited exclusively through the mother. Mitochondrial disease is an umbrella term including a wide range of illnesses, with the severity of the disease dependent on how much of the DNA contains the mutation. The risk of developing serious illness due to mitochondrial disease is considered to be between one in 5,000 and one in 10,000. However, it is estimated that around one in 200 Australians is predisposed to mitochondrial disease, and approximately 56 children are born each year with a severe form of the disease. There are no typical symptoms, and, historically, diagnosing mitochondrial diseases has been challenging. Critically, a mother can carry mitochondrial disease unknowingly. There is no cure for mitochondrial disease, just the treatment of symptoms. In its most severe form, the disease can be debilitating, and children can die early in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill contains provisions that only women with a high level of mutations would be eligible to use mitochondrial donation, which this bill proposes to enable, in an effort to stop the mother from passing on the mutated genes to her offspring. This technique will not remove mitochondrial disease from the community. Children with mitochondrial disease would still be born. Mitochondrial donation will not impact asymptomatic female carriers, because they wouldn't realise they're at risk. Nuclear DNA mutations, which make up approximately 50 per cent of mitochondrial disease, are caused by this. This is not impacted by this legislation, nor would it impact on new mutations in the child born.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research for treatments needs to remain the focus. In the view of many, the bill before us today is ill advised and certainly premature. It would allow deliberate heritable human germline gene manipulation and transfer. The risks for children born using these techniques are not yet fully understood, and the available scientific evidence to support this procedure is limited. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child exhorts signatories, including Australia, to act on the principle that a child, by reason of its physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection before as well as after birth. While, of course, no child ever consents to being born, and all the joy and agony that that can come with, the implementation of this bill would burden future generations with unpredictable impacts on human gene pool integrity and pass without Australians being informed or giving consent to these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It ignores experts who say clinical use of mitochondrial DNA transfer is too risky to yet be allowed in humans. While it would enable mitochondrial DNA disease afflicted parents to have children genetically related to them, the children would also be related to a third party. There would be three genetic parents for such a child. This procedure is a high-risk experiment instead of safer methods for such parents to have mitochondrial DNA disease-free children, though admittedly not ones related to both parents. Moving down this path would also create a climate of acceptance for other uses of the techniques—potentially, gender selection, genetic enhancement or to renovate older human eggs that are unfit for purpose. Such procedures should also remain not permitted. I encourage all members of parliament and those interested in these areas to watch the 1997 movie <span style="font-style:italic;">Gattaca</span>. It is an accessible and thought-provoking way to understand and consider some of these issues. It will certainly make one pause. This bill will also enable a process that requires the creation of an embryo solely for the intended purpose of destroying it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019-20, the National Health and Medical Research Council undertook a series of community consultative activities on this matter. There was also a Senate inquiry. Through those consultative processes, there was significant community support for legalising mitochondrial donation for use in Australia. However, these consultations also identified that the majority also recommended that a cautious and nationally regulated approach with appropriate safeguards and ongoing monitoring would be essential. A number of ethical issues associated with mitochondrial donation have also been identified, with some members of the community concerned that the technology would result in three-parent children or a form of genetic modification. Concerns regarding the rights of the child, privacy of parents and children and ensuring informed consent and donor rights and responsibilities were also identified. Ultimately, there were many unknowns, given the relative newness of the science, including in relation to the safety and efficacy of the techniques as well as the potential for unintended consequences in the longer term that would benefit from further research. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting the human rights of any child who may be born using the new experimental mitochondrial DNA techniques should be prioritised, especially to meet our responsibilities under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. As it stands, it appears a child born in the clinical experiments and any descendants would have no rights to redress or compensation for adverse health or other impacts resulting from the use of the high-risk, novel techniques and procedures that this bill proposes to license. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill greatly reduces the genetically engineered mitochondrial DNA child's rights when it grants immunity from civil liability or accountability to Commonwealth government officials, government appointees or other categories of protected person for a broad range of protected actions. So, should a child's right have priority over the aspirations of its parents with mitochondrial DNA disease to try for their own genetically related child through this clinical process? The child, created using its mother's nuclear DNA, would still have a high risk of suffering the same debilitating mitochondrial disease as she does. Such prospective parents already have several well-established, much safer, lower-risk options available to create a mitochondrial-DNA-disease-free family without it needlessly and unacceptably infringing the rights of the child or their descendants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The law already permits IVF, screening of donated sperm and egg, adoption and fostering, which more assuredly protect the rights of a child to good health and freedom from its parents' disease. In the United States, mitochondrial donation is banned due to the impact it may have on germline, and it needs more research. The view there is that it is currently too unsafe for use in humans. While in the UK such procedures have been permitted since 2017, there is no confirmed live birth using this method and it is not permitted in any other country. This is all with good reason. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that, as a father of two so far seemingly healthy children, this is all relatively easy for me to say. My heart swells for the parents who, knowing their biological children would also have this debilitating disease, are confronted with such very difficult choices. In no way do I dismiss their passionate, good-faith advocacy and I have nothing but compassion for their situation. It may still be that further research allows us to revisit this issue in the future with more very necessary information. There must be more conclusive research data on the safety, efficacy, equity and ethics of this gene manipulation before I am able to vote for this in good conscience. It's simply too risky. One should not be playing God. I cannot support the bill. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  I appreciate the sensitive and respectful way that members are approaching this issue and talking about this issue. I get that it is a conscience vote and these sorts of ethical debates are always very hard, because you have to grapple with your own conscience. You have to, of course, take the views of your electorate. Many people are influenced largely by their upbringing, their church, what their parents told them and what they have experienced in their own lives. I am no different to anybody in this place in that regard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very difficult topic. I've had correspondence from many people within my electorate. I've listened to their views. I've respected their opinions. I've talked with many constituents. I've had letters from religious leaders within the Riverina. I appreciate that my bishop, Mark Edwards—I'm a Catholic—who is new to the diocese and for whom I've got the highest regard, has quite correctly pointed out to me that he heads a very conservative diocese. He says his heart and, he assured me, the hearts of everyone go out to families who have children with mitochondrial disease and to those with the understandable desire that their future children not suffer these burdens. He pointed out to me—and no-one would have any countenance to this—that we all want to spare children illness and suffering. I understand that, and I respect that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I entered parliament in 2010, the erstwhile senator John Williams said to me once, as we were having a quiet discussion about life, that no-one should ever complain about getting old because, as he quite correctly pointed out, some don't get the chance. Some don't get the opportunity to grow old; they die young. Whilst it's far removed from this debate, a 20-month-old child was, sadly, taken today when they were crushed by a truck in Temora Shire. When I read the report, my stomach churned—and I can hear the member for Dawson grieving behind me, just from hearing me say that. It is heart-wrenching. The member for Dawson and I have had a few disagreements lately, but I respect his advocacy. I know he is the father of a very young daughter. My children aren't that young these days, I'm happy to say. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker said that he hopes his children grow up healthy and happy, and I think that's all parents can ever hope for. Nobody starts out as a parent wanting anything other than that. Sure, as life goes on they all want them to be astronauts or prime ministers or the best they can be. But at the outset they just want their kids to be happy and healthy, and, quite frankly, if they're happy and healthy then being astronauts or prime ministers or anything else doesn't really matter—as long as they be their best selves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To former Senator Williams's point that not everybody gets the chance to live to an old age: I have grappled with my conscience and I have tried to read as much as I can about this debate before us. These views have been expressed to me by people within my electorate. My office staff are very, very good when I'm out and about in my very large electorate. When I was the Deputy Prime Minister they took a number of constituents' interviews, and I thank them for that. They listened empathetically and with a heartfelt manner, as they always do. My staff are so exceptional.</span>

This afternoon I rang one of those constituents. She was on her way to delivering some goodies as a part of a fundraiser for a local high school. That's the sort of person she is. This is the sort of person that I know we've all got in our electorates. Her name is Nicole Baldry. She's a young mother. She's a farmer with her husband, Carl, near Bethungra. Nicole and Carl have four beautiful children, but one of them is not with them anymore. They have Angus, who is 12; George, who is eight; and Rupert, who is almost two. But they don't have Henry. Henry died on 7 April 2016. He was a beautiful child in every way. I shared with Nicole my own mother's grief that she had for a baby lost, stillborn. I am looking forward to meeting Senator Kristina Keneally on Thursday about her particular advocacy in that regard. My mother grieved for her whole life at losing a baby who she carried to full term and lost on the day he was born. Whilst we never got to know that little boy, my mother never stopped mourning him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Nicole and Carl will never stop mourning baby Henry, who died at nine days old—nine days young. She said he was perfect for the first 10 hours, but he never fed and never opened his eyes. She wrapped him up and laid him in a little crib, and he made a noise that she felt was odd. She had had two children, and mothers know instinctively when something is not right, much more so than, perhaps, fathers. I am a father, and I admit that mothers know; they just do. She said she called the nurse, and the nurse came straight away for a welfare check on her as a young mum having just had a newborn. The nurse ran down the corridor and got some other help to see what was wrong with little Henry, and Henry was not right. This was at Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. Henry was transferred to Sydney, and later on he died in Westmead Children's Hospital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It took, almost unbelievably, a full year—just think about that; 12 long months—for the biopsies to determine that little Henry died from mitochondrial disease. The grieving of Nicole and Carl didn't stop then; at least they knew what Henry had passed away from. Nicole is a very big advocate for this legislation to be passed because she doesn't want to see other families suffer the way she has, the way her family has. She says that whilst she doesn't actually have it, there is a fifty-fifty chance she would carry it on to any future babies; both she and her husband carry the genes to pass it on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When couples fall in love—most of us can probably remember when we fell in love with Miss Right or Mr Right—they might get engaged and get married, and they might just decide to have children together. We live in a modern world, and no-one holds anything against people. What people want is to provide a loving, caring, nurturing home. When they have kids, they just want them to be happy and healthy, but when you fall in love, you don't know the person with whom you fall in love, be it a male-female, female-female or male-male relationship. You don't know whether the genes that you both possess are going to cause hardship and heartache and debilitating illnesses and diseases for the children, the offspring, that you may produce in the future. This legislation can provide you with at least the ability to predetermine that your children will be happy and healthy. Going back to what former senator Williams said, that is all that you want for your kids—for them to grow up to an older age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it's difficult legislation. I appreciate that it's a conscience vote and there will be members who will vote no all in good conscience. There will be members who vote yes all in good conscience. No-one should think any less of anybody for whichever way they do decide to vote. Indeed, people out in our electorates should not think anything less of how anyone decides to vote, just like with the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill in the New South Wales parliament, which has been taking up so many headlines in so many newspapers in recent times. These are difficult debates, but having a vote on these is what I think makes our society better and makes our society stronger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Far be it from me to come into this place, having served 11 years here, and not vote the way that I think some families would like me to vote, because I don't want to have to look them in the eye down the track years from now and for them to have a child who is profoundly ill because of a mitochondrial condition that could have been avoided had perhaps I voted a different way. I don't want to, in one sense, play God in that respect. I appreciate religious leaders will say, 'You are playing God anyway.' I'd like to think I am faith driven. I do pray—I pray for a better society every day in many ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, having spoken to Nicole Baldry today, she said that she could see why people would say that mitochondrial intervention would provide blue-eyed, blond-haired, genetically perfect children. That's not what this is about. It's about making sure that, if people are predisposed to or carrying mitochondrial genes, they can avoid passing it on to children who would then potentially suffer a life of heartache, pain, disfigurement, and going to school and suffering all the torment and bullying that, sadly, children who are born different—if I can put it that way—endure, even today. Nicole said, and it was quite profound, 'I would do anything to stop my child living through that.' I know that what Nicole Baldry said would be the view of so many parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nicole told me she met a 74-year-old man who suffered from conditions of mitochondrial symptoms. He expressed to her how difficult his life had been, how hard his entire existence had been, because of what he had endured. I have to say that her conversation, her arguments and her advocacy were very compelling. For that reason—not just Nicole's viewpoint but the viewpoints of many others, whilst fully respecting the viewpoints of those opposed—I will be supporting this legislation. In good conscience and for the fact that I want kids to have their best start, their best lives, I will be supporting this legislation, as difficult as it is.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  It's not often in this place we are given an opportunity to vote according to our conscience. When these times do come around, it is a moment of great import for this parliament because, while we disagree much of the time in this place, what makes this type of vote different is that our debate will be not just along party policy lines but also based on each member's philosophy, values and conscience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 amends existing acts to make mitochondrial donation legal in Australia. We've heard that mitochondrial donation is a procedure that allows women to have a biological child in a way that minimises the risk of transmission of mitochondrial disease. We've heard that this is a disease for which there is no cure, that can leave young children with multiple organ failure or heart problems, can cause seizures and can be fatal. Mito disease is a genetic, often inherited, disorder that can be passed on from the mother and, in some cases, develop at conception. Each year, here in Australia, around 56 children are born with a severe form of the disease. That's one child a week. The tragic projection for these children is that many will die within the first five years of their lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these children, and the namesake of this bill, Maeve Hood, has a severe type of mitochondrial disease that was diagnosed at 18 months. Thankfully Maeve is one of the more fortunate children and is still here with us. She's five years old and has just finished her first year of kindergarten. But her family, of course, lives with the uncertainty that each day brings. As a father of two young children, and I know many of the members here would have the same feeling, I can only imagine the heartache and anguish of parents of children who suffer from such a devastating disease. There are significant mental health costs associated with watching a family member's child or friend die from mito.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, the financial costs associated with mitochondrial disease are high. The Mito Foundation estimates lifetime healthcare costs for a child born with a rare disease, such as mito, is around $2.5 million in the UK and about $5 million in the US. Aside from these sorts of costs which are incurred, there are social services, income disability support and reduction in economic participation from affected individuals, parents and other carers. In his submission to the Senate inquiry, Professor Thorburn, a co-Group Leader of Brain &amp; Mitochondrial Research at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, estimated that mitochondrial donation could provide between $33 and $66 million a year in healthcare savings based on a conservative estimate of five to 10 children per year born without mito.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of Maeve's Law is to legalise mitochondrial donation for particular research, training and reproductive purposes. Mitochondrial donation is an IVF based technique known as assisted reproductive technology, or ART. There are several mitochondrial donation techniques, including maternal spindle transfer, MST, and pronuclear transfer, PNT. Both of these techniques are currently legal in the United Kingdom. Basically, depending on these techniques, nuclear DNA is removed from the affected mother's egg at different stages. With MST it's pre fertilisation and with PNT it's after fertilisation of the egg. The nuclear DNA is removed from the affected mother's egg, which contains the mutated mitochondria, and the nuclear DNA is inserted into a healthy donor egg which has had its nuclear DNA removed but retains its mitochondrial DNA, which is the donation part. For the record, this is only 0.1 per cent of the entire human DNA. This is not a treatment for people who already suffer from mito, of course, but the procedure aims to allow a mother who carries mitochondrial DNA mutations to have a genetically related child who has a reduced risk of mitochondrial disease occurring. The Mito Foundation estimates that in Australia between 50 and 60 children each year could be born free from mito if mitochondrial donation was legalised. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are a number of medical and ethical concerns that have been raised with respect to the legalisation of this procedure in Australia. I recognise these concerns and have engaged and consulted with stakeholders over the past 12 months. In 2018 the Senate Community Affairs References Committee undertook an inquiry, which I've referred to, into the science of mitochondrial donation and examined the impacts of the disease and the legal and ethical considerations associated with a mitochondrial donation. One of the issues raised is the status of the embryo, and many stakeholders raised ethical concerns that the creation of an embryo for the purpose of destroying it violates the dignity that is owed to the embryo. I would note that this objection also applies broadly to the ethical use of embryos. It is not limited to mitochondrial donation but in fact applies to all forms of ART, including IVF, which, as we know, has helped families have children for some 37 years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that there are different religious views and interpretations about the moral status of the embryo. Not all faiths are the same. Even within the Christian faith, there are big differences between the Catholic faith and the Orthodox faith, for example, about at which point in time the embryo is considered to have that moral status. This is why some of these faiths have different views around contraception and IVF and other types of technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other big issue is the so-called third-parent issue, which we've heard some people raise. As part of the inquiry, a question was raised as to whether mitochondrial donation is different or distinct from germline genetic modification. 'Germ line' refers to the cells through which DNA is inherited by offspring. In humans this includes reproductive cells. In most jurisdictions, germ-line modification is illegal as it allows for the alteration of certain characteristics of a child. The inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee received a number of submissions on this issue. The committee's report concluded that mitochondrial donation should not be considered a form of germ-line genetic modification, even though it results in changes to mitochondrial DNA that can affect future generations—again, noting that this relates to only 0.1 per cent of the entire human DNA—because mitochondrial DNA has no effect on the traits or characteristics of a person such as personality, appearance, intelligence and so on. The committee accepts that there is a substantive difference between mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA. It's the latter that changes the characteristics of a person. The genetic contribution of the so-called third parent in this process is the donation through the process of MST or PNT, where the mitochondrial DNA is donated, and it is vastly smaller than the contribution of the intending parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the UK, where mitochondrial  donation has already been legalised, the donor is considered to be the equivalent of an organ donor. This is an important point because the UK took the view that MST and PNT resulted in some germ-line modification, because the effects are passed on. However, it was decided that mitochondrial donation techniques do not constitute genetic modification, since this was defined as requiring germ-line modification of the nuclear DNA—the majority part of what makes a person a human being. That is what can be passed on to future generations. There were similar fears raised about heart and bone marrow transplants when  those technologies were first proposed and utilised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are of course issues in relation to carryover mutated mito-DNA and haplogroup matching—very scientific and very technical—which I have spent a fair bit of time going through, as I think all members have, to try and better understand the science. We know that mitochondrial DNA is transferred maternally through the biological mother and that, therefore, the mitochondrial DNA changes can transfer through the female child. Hence there has been a call in some submissions and in other jurisdictions for only male embryos to be used so as to limit that transfer. There are also issues around haplogroup matching and whether that should be a voluntary matching by the parents with the donor and the mother's eggs. These are issues that I have raised, discussed and consulted on with stakeholders who are medical professionals, scientists, religious leaders and other stakeholders to satisfy myself as a lawmaker that these issues are substantively and ethically dealt with in this legislation, particularly through the very careful and staged approach to the implementation of this technology in our jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that has been raised is whether donors should be anonymous or whether the child has a right to know the identity of the donor. This question needs to be considered from the perspective of the donor and the perspective of a child who may be born of this technique. In the United Kingdom they allow a child to discover only non-identifying information about the donor from the age of 16, making the donation effectively anonymous. On the other side of the debate, under UK law a donor is entitled to know how many children have been born from their donated material, the sex of those children and the years in which they were born. The rationale in the UK for making the donation anonymous is that mitochondrial donation is more akin to organ or tissue donation than to reproductive donation, and the preference for anonymity reflects that fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side of the debate too, women who choose to donate their eggs for mito-donation may be making a small contribution to this process, but it is fundamental to the child born as a result. To understate this contribution overlooks the significance of the physical donation and the difference it will make to the child's life. There are many other significant factors to consider, including the child's right to know their biological heritage and the shift in Australian attitudes towards making known information about a person's biological heritage in both the adoption space and other forms of IVF. These factors led the committee to find that children who are born from mitochondrial techniques should be entitled to know the donor if they want to but that it should be conceptualised as being similar to an organ donation, because they are donating non-nuclear genetic material. As such, the bill sets out the Mitochondrial Donation Donor Register, which will be a safe and secure record for storing details about those born as a result of mito donation. It will also allow the child, once 18, to find out the identity of their donor. Other groups have identified concern for anticipated consent, which is the issue about whether the child would consent to the procedure, something that we can never know for sure, obviously, but it's important to note in this debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to note for the record that I support the amendments to this bill, which address some of those ethical and medical concerns raised through the committee inquiry process, particularly clarifying that donated mitochondria must be sourced from human eggs; expanding and clarifying the circumstances in which 'proper consent' is needed before mitochondrial donation techniques are used; clarifying the circumstances in which the Embryo Research Licensing Committee is able to seek expert advice when performing its statutory functions; enhancing mitochondrial donor privacy through provisions relating to the register; and further enhancing privacy by ensuring that the ERLC statutory reports to parliament cannot disclose identifiable personal information. These amendments reflect the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. No doubt, the science around this is immensely complex. The United Kingdom conducted four scientific reviews that concluded the benefits outweighed the potential risk, and these reviews are utilised as the basis for many conclusions that we have drawn here in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to note that mito donation will be introduced in a very staged and closely monitored way as part of this legislation, the first stage being donation legalised for certain research and training purposes, including for the purpose of undertaking a clinical trial of the use of mitochondrial donation techniques, whether it be MST or PNT or some of the other, more experimental techniques as part of the human ART. The second stage will commence when regulations are made prescribing mito donation techniques for use in clinical practice. These arrangements have been based on the approach the UK has taken in legalising mito donation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly support this staged introduction of mitochondrial donation and the very close monitoring that is part of it. This law is not about allowing <span style="font-style:italic;">Gattaca</span> style designer babies, free of all genetic alteration; it's not about that, as the previous speaker noted. It provides strict legislative oversight, allowing one or two medical facilities to start trials to find out which methods work best. The reality is it will likely be a decade or more before any treatment will become available outside a clinical trial setting. But it provides families with hope that this terrible disease will not be passed on through future generations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to recognise the work of Maeve's parents, Joel and Sarah Hood, the many tireless advocates, and the member for Macarthur and the member for Higgins for their advocacy on this law. The bill is in Maeve's honour, but, if passed, will ensure that other children and parents don't have to suffer the consequences of this horrible disease, like Maeve and so many other children and parents have had to deal with—children that otherwise would have lived a rich, full life past the age of five. I support this bill and the amendments.</span>

The Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 offers a chance to prevent an insidious genetic disease inflicting further pain and misery on future generations. I understand this bill is controversial, and I would like to outline why I am in favour of it. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondria are tiny structures within our cells which produce 90 per cent of our body's energy needs. They are passed from mother to child through the mother's egg cells. These tiny but vital structures within our cells can be afflicted by disease. These diseases are genetic, caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. The disease varies in presentation and severity, but common symptoms include developmental delays, seizures, weakness and fatigue, muscle pain, vision and hearing loss, multiple organ failure and heart problems, leading to morbidity and, in severe cases, premature death. Around one in 200 Australians are estimated to be predisposed to mitochondrial disease, and approximately 56 children are born each year with a severe form of the disease. The prognosis for these children is that most will die within their first five years. Currently, there is no known cure for mitochondrial disease, and treatment options are mostly limited to management of symptoms. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This terrible disease can be prevented. 'Mitochondrial donation' refers to an IVF process that allows a woman whose own mitochondria may predispose her children to genetic disease to have a biological child that does not inherit that predisposition. Mitochondrial donation allows the mother's mitochondria, which may pass on the genetic disease, to be replaced with a donor's in the IVF process. The egg with the donor's mitochondria and the mother's nucleus DNA can then be fertilised by the father's sperm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to address some of the criticism of this bill. This process does not create designer babies. It is a targeted process, only substituting a donor's healthy mitochondria for the mother's mitochondria. Mitochondrial DNA has no bearing on eye colour, appearance or any other factor to do with a person's personality. That is all in the nucleus DNA, which is unchanged in the process. For this reason, it does not create three-parent babies. The child will have only two biological parents—its father and mother—and will get its nuclear DNA and all its inherent characteristics from its biological parents. The mitochondrial DNA will have no bearing on this. Mitochondrial donation is not cloning. Children born through this process will inherit their nucleus DNA and their genetic diversity from their biological parents in the same way as any child naturally born.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My decision to be in favour of this bill was assisted by the experience in the United Kingdom. In 2015, the United Kingdom legalised mitochondrial donation after extensive public consultation and scientific reviews. They now have a licensed clinic which operates in a very stringent regulatory framework. The bill before us today is, in many ways, inspired by what is best practice determined through the UK experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to amend a number of Commonwealth laws to permit mitochondrial donation for research and human reproductive purposes. The bill does this in a highly regulated and controlled manner, which is appropriate for a new area of research in a delicate area. The bill will be implemented in stages. The first stage will see the legalisation of mitochondrial donation for certain research and training purposes. This will allow an assessment of feasibility and safety to be made before any broader rollout. This will also help build expertise within Australia and will allow clinical trials, which will have the added benefit of allowing some affected families to have access to the technology sooner in a regulated clinical setting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will allow for five different mitochondrial donation licences to be granted for areas including clinical trials, research and practice. The Embryo Research Licensing Committee, the ERLC, of the NHMRC will see its regulatory remit expanded to oversee these licences and their requirements, such as reporting and monitoring. Certain licences will have specific conditions relating to the approval processes for individuals seeking access to mitochondrial donation. These licences will also specify only certain mitochondrial donation techniques. Initially, the bill permits only the techniques known as maternal spindle transfer, or MST, and pronuclear transfer, or PNT, for use under a mitochondrial donation clinical trial research and training licence or clinical trial licence. This is also the case in the United Kingdom, and these two techniques have had extensive scientific research and review. It is important to highlight that some of these mitochondria donation processes involve fertilised eggs that are not used. However, these are dealt with very early in the process, before the number of cell divisions required to form an embryo.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second stage will only occur after years of demonstrated success in clinical trials. Depending on the results of the trials, further regulations and discussions of legalisation with states and territories could see accredited assisted reproductive technology centres across Australia offer mitochondrial donation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill largely aligns with current regulations on assisted reproductive treatment, or ART. Mitochondrial egg donors are not considered legal parents, and eggs can only be donated voluntarily by family, friends or others who agree to donate or have eggs in excess of their own needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the extensive public consultation that has occurred with this bill. In 2018, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee conducted an inquiry into the science of mitochondrial donation and related matters. The final report made four recommendations for further community consultation and scientific review to be undertaken, and for those findings to inform options for legislative change. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee considered the bill, with public submissions and hearings, in its August 2021 report summarising its submissions. The NHMRC also dealt with this topic at length in 2019, with public consultations, webinars and a citizens panel. This year in February 2021 the Department of Health released a public discussion paper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ethical questions people may have regarding the bill are well documented in these public consultations, and I thank everyone who raised their concerns to the various committees and panels. I think what we have now is a measured and targeted bill that addresses many of the concerns of adopting this new technology while providing an option for parents who, through no fault of their own, may have predisposition to this awful genetic disease: an option to have their own genetic children who have healthy mitochondria. It is easy to get caught up in the detailed regulations and medical and legal terminology with this bill, but the fact remains that this bill is about doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people. I have had many in my electorate talk to me about this issue. They do not want to see their children or any child suffer from a preventable disease, and neither do I.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  I rise to speak on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021. Genetic illness is an issue that's always been close to my heart. Throughout my parliamentary career I have constantly sought to advocate the wellbeing of families and individuals that suffer with such diseases. My work with Rare Voices Australia, the national peak body advocating for Australians living with rare diseases, and my own experience with my own family have informed my views on these very important issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's often thought that only those who have directly experienced it can understand the turmoil that accompanies the diagnosis of a rare disease or illness for both the individual diagnosed and their family. In addition to the physical degradation that is the hallmark of such diseases, many of which are terminal, the emotional distress which accompanies such diseases is immense. Genetic and mitochondrial diseases are often rare and, as such, often lack adequate research and support services, compounding the strain on those suffering from them. Mitochondrial and other genetic disease, and both its physical and emotional impacts, is something I do not wish upon anyone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This law will allow so many families who wish to have biological children the opportunity to do so. I think about Bethany Hodge and her husband, James, who live in my electorate. They hope to have children, but Beth's sister suffers from a mitochondrial disease known as MERRF syndrome, which significantly impacts her quality of life. Beth has discovered she is a carrier of this mitochondrial disease. Seeing the way her sister has struggled with the disease, Beth and her husband, James, do not want to expose their children and future generations to the possibility of experiencing it. The passing of this bill would allow Beth and James to have their own biological children without the fear of passing on such a severe disease. Beth told me that the passing of Maeve's Law will completely change the future for her family. She said she can't put into words how desperately her family want the chance to have their own healthy child. There are thousands of families like Beth's and James's across the country, and it's my belief that we owe them all our due consideration of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through my own family's history with Marfan syndrome, which resulted in the death of my younger brother and cousins, it's my belief that science offers us an opportunity to prevent suffering. I think that we should all seize that opportunity to have that developed. This world is defined by countless challenges which, every day, we struggle to resolve. For the domestic and global burdens of conflict, poverty and famine, and, indeed, the illnesses that are complex issues, solutions often remain outside our grasp. The suffering that accompanies mitochondrial disease is a hardship which we have the power to avert. Through careful research we have discovered a way to prevent suffering before it even begins, and I proudly rise in this chamber to advocate that we do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The risk of developing serious illness due to mitochondrial disease is small, but it is immensely significant for those who ultimately experience it. Around one in 200 Australians are estimated to be predisposed to mitochondrial disease, and approximately 56 children are born each year with a severe form of the disease. Most of these children are expected to have a life of around only five years. There is no known cure for mitochondrial disease and the treatment options are mostly limited to management of symptoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial donation is an assisted reproductive technology that, when combined with IVF, has the potential to allow women whose mitochondria would predispose their potential children to have a biological child that does not inherit that risk. The bill before the House introduces safeguards to ensure that the techniques are safe, effective and properly regulated. It also protects the privacy of the persons who make use of mitochondrial donation techniques.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the bill, mitochondrial donation will be introduced in a staged and closely monitored way. In the first stage, mitochondrial donation will be legalised for certain research and training purposes, including the purpose of undertaking a clinical trial of the use of mitochondrial donation techniques as part of human assisted reproductive technology. The aim of this approach is to build an Australian evidence base in relation to the safety and efficacy of mitochondrial donation techniques and associated issues such as feasibility, service delivery and costed impacts prior to a decision being made on introducing the use of techniques more broadly into the clinical practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that this staged approach to the use of mitochondrial donation is supported by rare illness advocacy groups such as Rare Voices Australia, with whom I have consulted. I know the work that they do for people who have absolute hardship in dealing with their own issues. It's so important that people like those at Rare Voices Australia are heard and supported, and I think the government should do all they can to make sure that there is proper funding and support available to families dealing with rare illnesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The use of specified mitochondrial donation techniques under this first stage would be subject to very strict licensing conditions. Once the clinical trial has demonstrated success over several years and the results have been evaluated by the experts, there will be an option to move to the second stage of this staged implementation, which would allow for accredited assisted reproduction technology centres across Australia to offer mitochondrial donation in a clinical practice as part of assisted reproductive therapy. Before such techniques could be used in a particular state or territory, the state or territory would need to enact its own laws authorising the use of the technique. The state or territory would, in doing so, be able to further regulate the use of the technique as part of its regulation of assisted reproductive technologies in its jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are some groups with concerns about this new technology, and I honestly believe that many of those concerns have been addressed in wide community consultation. I am very conscious, though, that the benefits of greatly reducing the impact of mitochondrial disease on children's families and future generations is fundamental to a small but significant number of families across the nation, and the benefits that we seek to see far outweigh the risks of introducing mitochondrial donation overall. I am proud to add my voice to support these families—families like my own and families that live in my electorate—and so that Bethany Hodge and her husband, James, can have their child and know that that child is going to have a wonderful life and an opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite there being people who have different views, let's just have a look at who this will impact. When we look at who it will impact, I think we as leaders of this nation have an obligation to support science, support the opportunity and particularly support those families who this directly impacts. With that, I wish this bill speedy passage.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:23</span>):  I rise to speak on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021. This bill will allow women whose children would otherwise be susceptible to life-threatening mitochondrial disease to avoid their children inheriting it. This is a disease that significantly reduces life expectancy and quality of life, and it's very difficult to diagnose. There are currently no known cures for mitochondrial disease, with treatment options generally aimed at managing symptoms. The risk of developing serious illness is around one in 5,000 to one in 10,000, but approximately one in 200 Australians may be predisposed to mitochondrial disease. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial donation is an assisted reproductive technology that, when combined with in-vitro fertilisation, or IVF, as it is so well known, has the potential to allow women whose mitochondria would predispose their potential children to this disease to have a healthy biological child. The process creates an embryo which includes nuclear DNA from the man and the woman seeking to have the child as well as mitochondrial DNA from a donor egg, minimising the risk of transmission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill establishes a national regulatory framework which allows different types of mitochondrial donation techniques for clinical use under a clinical trial licence for human reproduction. One of these is maternal spindle transfer. This involves removing the maternal spindle of both the prospective mother's egg and the mitochondrial donor's egg prior to fertilisation. The maternal spindle which has been removed from the mother's egg is then placed into the mitochondrial donor egg, which is then fertilised to form a zygote and then an embryo. The egg cell of the prospective mother, which no longer contains any nuclear DNA, is discarded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another technique outlined in this bill is pronuclear transfer. While I acknowledge that the science involved is very complex, I do have some personal concerns with this method, arising from my own personal faith. Pronuclear transfer requires fertilisation of both the prospective mother's egg and the mitochondrial donor's egg, using the father's sperm to produce two zygotes. It's at this stage that the pronuclear transfer occurs. The two pronuclei are removed from the zygote produced from the egg cell of the prospective mother and placed into the zygote which is produced from the egg cell of the mitochondrial donor. Following this, the zygote which is produced from the egg cell of the prospective mother, and which no longer contains any nuclear DNA, is discarded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My concerns with this technique relate specifically to the creation of a zygote with the specific intention that it will later be destroyed. Whilst I acknowledge that there are a range of views in this place, and indeed around the nation, as to when human life begins, I personally cannot support this method. While I acknowledge that there are different definitions of when human life begins—whether that be a medical definition, a religious definition of many different kinds, a legal definition or otherwise—for me and for others who hold religious beliefs, this view of when life begins is deeply rooted in our faith. I acknowledge that, although I hold a Christian faith, this is something that is very personal in terms of when one might believe that life begins.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's something that I had to wrestle with when, some 13 years ago, I underwent IVF myself in order to have our first-born son, Oscar, whom I absolutely adore and think the world of. But I remember the wrestle that I had to go through in this process, trying to hold both my faith and the very deep desire to have a healthy child, having experienced some very great challenges and complications prior to this. The only way that I could safely have my baby was to go through the IVF process, so that meant I had to weigh this whole decision up and think through carefully what this meant for me, given my own personal religious beliefs. Being able to arrive at a realisation that I personally could choose to perhaps restrict how my IVF procedure would go, such that I would just look at fertilising the number of eggs that we intended to use, was a very difficult decision, but it was one that I had to weigh up carefully and where I realised the deeply personal aspect of legislation and techniques like this. This is an area where there is no easy decision. You weigh up the consequences heavily and deeply, and they are very personal. Many—not all, of course—have a deeply held religious belief that life begins at conception. For me, it's because I believe that as humans we are made in the image of God and that is why human life is so sacred. As such, I foreshadow that I will support any appropriately worded amendments that may be moved in this House that would seek to remove the technique of pronuclear transfer from this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also raise some concerns regarding certain provisions in the bill that allow parents to request that only male embryos be implanted and that any female embryos be discarded for medical reasons. Under current Australian law, sex selection of embryos under assisted reproductive technologies is already permitted in cases of a serious genetic condition, and it is unclear why a licence holder could not simply rely on this existing provision and why this bill explicitly states that selection of male embryos over females is permitted. Should there be appropriately worded amendments made in this House that remove this sex selection provision from this bill, I would also support this in the House. This medical advancement allows that descendants of those born from mitochondrial donation will have two sets of genetic material. It's one of those issues which, again, I've had to weigh up very carefully. I acknowledge that I'm not a scientist. I acknowledge that these are matters that go way beyond what perhaps we as legislators—</span>

Their typical routine involves daily intensive physiotherapy to clear her lungs; enzyme replacement capsules to aid digestion; and nebulisers and antibiotics to treat lung infections. They can't afford Trikafta. Maureen is the great-grandmother of a six-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis and his two-year-old brother is a carrier of the CF gene. She would like them to live longer, and Trikafta could help. Lucy, who is 25 years old, grew up in the Blue Mountains. She has university qualifications in science and lives with cystic fibrosis. She was diagnosed at two months old. Her daily routine involves 50 tablets, 56 puffers, five nebulisers, two hours of airway clearance, daily exercise and a careful diet—on top of her full-time job. What her routine doesn't include is Trikafta.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another chance for this remarkable treatment, which can have a huge impact on lung function, to be listed on the PBS this year. For the sake of these families and the more than 2,000 people over 12 for whom it's already been approved but is not within financial reach, I hope we see that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hawkesbury is justifiably proud of its agricultural roots. The first colonial settlers planted crops along the river in 1794, saving the infant colony from starvation—and, of course, First Peoples recognised the bounty of the region long before. Hawkesbury Agricultural College, established in 1891 in Richmond, has been a key part of that agricultural history. The Hawkesbury campus of Western Sydney University has a big role now and going forward, especially for peri-urban agriculture. The WSU vision is for an agri-tech hub with a state-of-the-art greenhouse where industry and researchers can investigate food technology and land use management to develop a sustainable approach to peri-urban farming. We're talking high tech: developing adaptive drone technology and robotics for growing and logistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Building on the great work being done in the recently built giant greenhouse, which I was delighted to visit with my shadow minister for education a couple of years ago, the collaboration is there between industry and research. They will draw on the work already being done by the School of Science and at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, which itself is doing world-leading work on climate change. This is an institute that was established when Labor was in government, and it looks at what rising CO2 levels mean for forestry, soils and agriculture industries, as well as native plants and animals, and how we can use technology to understand and better manage our most important natural and managed ecosystems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The agri-tech hub is expected to generate more than $30 million of economic activity every year for the surrounding region. Jobs are part of this, including 1,300 jobs during construction and around 200 direct and indirect jobs once it's operational. These are jobs for a range of skills, from plumbers and engineers to environmental scientists and supply chain experts. Students at WSU will be able to learn in a work integrated environment so that they emerge with strong local industry knowledge and skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more than jobs and the ongoing learning, the agri-tech hub will provide a significant and ongoing supply of fresh produce to Western Sydney and greater New South Wales, greatly improving food security by being able to grow our own supplies here in quantity. This is a really exciting proposal, and I'm fully supportive of it. I hope that we're able to bring this vision to life. It will help us keep agriculture strong in the Hawkesbury.</span>

                  <a href="MT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Tonight, as the Victorian government looks set to pass this controversial pandemic bill, I feel compelled to acknowledge the Australians who, unlike me, have been forced to choose between getting vaccinated or losing their job. It makes no sense to me that Commonwealth officials who work in windowless offices are not mandated to be vaccinated, while vaccinations for farmers, producers and their workers in my electorate have been mandated. That's not right, it's not fair and it's not logical. For the record, I want to acknowledge that I know I'm privileged not to be faced with having to make such a decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past nine months, I've spoken with hundreds of people in distress, many who are suffering on a scale that I find difficult to comprehend. I'm sure that my fellow members and senators are also hearing gut-wrenching stories. I want to honour some of those people and bear witness to their suffering. I have purposely changed the names of the people that I'm about to explain to you because I don't want them to suffer significantly for the stance they've taken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, there's Nina, a single mum in her late 30s with two children, who felt coerced to get jabbed to keep her job as an aged-care nurse. Nina came away feeling violated after her first jab. The fact that she felt coerced into getting it left her reliving trauma associated with having been raped when she was 20. She said she feels disgusted in herself that she gave in to the coercion. Then there's Deani, a schoolteacher, and her 13-year-old daughter, who endured four weeks stranded in New South Wales, living in a stranger's caravan, whilst trying to get back into Queensland to rejoin her husband and son. David and Leah are primary school teachers and parents to three boys who are on unpaid leave while they wait to see if the mandates change. Carolyn is a doctor who has decided to retire early so she can speak freely and advocate for patients, family and friends. Ahmad is a chef who now provides companionship and cleaning services instead of doing the work that he loves. Bonnie, having recovered from COVID eight months ago, is fearful of being vaccinated and will lose her job as a hairdresser unless she can obtain an exemption. Tonya was told by her GP of more than 30 years that she couldn't see her face-to-face unless she was vaccinated. Katherine and Rick, parents of two teenage girls, have decided to sell their business to set up a sustainable life on the land with friends so their daughters don't have to get vaccinated, at least until their daughters can make up their own minds and make their own decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's Sarah, who lives with her partner and five children aged six to eighteen. Sarah and David have been registered nurses for the past 30 years and have lost jobs which they love simply because, in their professional medical opinion, they were not prepared to be jabbed with an experimental vaccine. Sarah was terminated from a nursing position after 24 years. Her partner was terminated from his position after 18 years of service. Sarah and David are now living off their limited savings and will soon join the Centrelink queue, which they have never done before, to pay their mortgage and bills and to feed their children because they're unable to find employment. More than anything, Sarah wanted to tell me about the impact this mandatory vaccination is having on her and her children. She is angry and scared and at a complete loss to understand the unnecessary and unfair adverse impacts on her children. Her son has just completed year 12 and works as a lifeguard at two local pools but can no longer do so. He also wants to go to university next year to study either nursing or paramedicine but now can't unless he gets double jabbed. He also can't pursue his love of participation in musicals or attend Venture Scouting activities. Sarah's 16-year-old daughter has all but completed her surf lifesaving certificate but can't volunteer now either. Her 10-year-old is the only child who can access the pool. However, this would be unsupervised as nobody else in the family can go. She ended with a plea for me to help save the children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Dr Nick Coatsworth, a highly regarded medical person, is completely at odds with the rest of the medical profession by saying he's strongly against the need for children to be vaccinated. I have to say so am I.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Australia's rural towns and outer metropolitan areas are home to millions of Australians. Many of these areas are experiencing fast population growth, far beyond the growth in infrastructure and support services that is required to properly accommodate the need of the influx of people. We know that more than five million people live in the fast-growing suburbs on the outskirts of our capital cities, and these outskirts produce 13 per cent of Australia's jobs and 11 per cent of our GDP. The outskirts population is expected to grow from five million to 7.5 million people in the next decade. Many of us who live in or close to these growth areas have witnessed the incredible land transformation as empty paddocks—sometimes some of our best farmland—make way for residential and commercial development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rapid infill of outer metropolitan regions imposes enormous strains on our road infrastructure, public transport systems and public infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, emergency services, and recreation and sporting facilities. Yet, despite this knowledge, we continue to fail to make the necessary infrastructure investments to support these areas of growth. Put simply, our growth models are broken. The eternal approach remains limited to portioning off land for development, followed by supporting infrastructure long after residents have moved in. We have it back to front. All governments—local, state and federal—must do better. Governments need to align their priorities so that we can strategically plan for growth in areas and, importantly, build the supporting infrastructure ahead of or in conjunction with the expansion of these regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned that our growth models are broken. What is also broken is the manner in which we fund infrastructure development. Rather than a systematic approach, which would be desirable, our methodology relies on leaders and representatives of these growth areas having to fight for every single dollar of investment. In my electorate of Mayo, I have several regions of growth. I've worked tirelessly to advocate for greater expenditure in these regions, and through my advocacy I have successfully secured nearly $240 million worth of projects. But it's always about retrofitting: $15 million for a freeway interchange at Verdun, funding for overtaking lanes at Victor Harbor and $15 million for an Adelaide Hills aquatic centre. We've received $4 million for trails in the Adelaide Hills and the Fleurieu Peninsula and some much-needed funding for the Aldinga Sports Complex, as well as piecemeal funding for our Victor Harbor and Mount Barker hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have so much more to do. Mount Barker and Aldinga, two of my fastest-growing regions, are struggling with the massive demand on services. It's taken years of lobbying and advocacy to get funding to upgrade the Mount Barker pool, a pool that was built in the 1960s and that our kids will be swimming in this summer, and it's in yards! We have road infrastructure and a freeway that isn't coping with current demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community have the right to demand the resumption of rail services to Mount Barker. We had rail infrastructure back in the 1980s, and then it was taken away from us. A mass rapid transport solution needs to be in place, and I believe rail is the way to go. We've got to be able to take that pressure off our one freeway, and we need park-and-rides. We need the extension of rail from Seaford Meadows down to Aldinga. Aldinga is a community of 15,000 people, which will increase, as it's predicted there will be another thousand blocks carved out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aldinga community have recently come together to call for a swimming pool, and I support them in that call. Our secondary schools and our primary schools are bursting, and this is all because we have the growing pains of the outer-metropolitan area. We have roads that are overrepresented in South Australia's road crash statistics. On one section of Victor Harbor Road alone, 43 people have died or been seriously injured in just the last four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have so much that we can do, but I think the funding system is around the wrong way. It's reactive rather than proactive. It has historically dealt with population growth in a manner that is not sustainable. Critical infrastructure is needed now. We need a better system, a new system that sets aside funding for these regions with high growth before people build their homes, not years after.</span>

                  </a>  The interjections are disorderly, Mr Speaker! I remind my colleagues that Gippsland is the only place you would want to live. One thing as a member of parliament, though, I'd advise my colleagues is that running a photographic competition is a great way to lose friends because you get so many amazing entries and you get to choose only 13 winners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a more serious note, the calendar is intended to promote Gippsland in all its diversity and all its attractions and encourage people to take a break in our region. As we recover from the combined impacts of drought, bushfires and coronavirus, we want our visitor economy to go well this summer. I know that the member for Jagajaga, who has visited the Gippsland Lakes and loves it enormously, will be down to visit Gippsland at her earliest possible convenience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a lighter note, I think we need to start with the cover. <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansa</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rd</span> won't do this full justice. It is of fairy wrens and was taken by Sarah. If you take a close look, Mr Speaker—and I will give you 20 or 30 copies!—you will see the middle child is really grumpy about missing out on a worm. When we get to January, we are looking at the sea caves at Secret Beach. It's not really a secret because it is actually just out of Mallacoota and we want as many people as possible to visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we flip over to February, we are into the beautiful Mitchell River area of Lindenow. As you know, Mr Speaker, Gippsland produces the greatest agricultural products in the land; it's very important that we reflect that in the February month.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In April, it's Anglers Rest in the high country. It's of a chilly autumn day in Anglers Rest. If you are in that area on your motorbike, Mr Speaker, please stop at the Blue Duck Inn. I can tell you that the Guinness pie is magnificent. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we flip over to May, we are on the Devil's Elbow, at the back of the Macalister River flats. As a young boy I grew up visiting the Macalister River flats and my family's farm at Paradise Valley, just down the road. Please take the time to visit my region and check out Paradise Valley or the Devil's Elbow.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June, this is a lovely reflective piece. It's a very serene piece of Cowwarr Dam, where a lot of people from the Latrobe Valley will cool off during these warm summer months approaching.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July we have the snow season. We have the stockyards. Just a couple of weeks ago, I drove across Mount Hotham. Would you believe that, at this time of year, we had snow falling in the Gippsland alps? It was a beautiful scene, and one that I am sure you would appreciate as well, Mr Speaker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">August is Ninety Mile Beach and reflections of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Trinculo</span>, which is actually a wreck on the beach. But the one thing I want to remind people who are following tonight's debate of is the Golden Beach fishing competition in late January. Please turn up for the fishing competition. It's a very big highlight of the year in my region.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">September is the Sale Common. There's nothing common about 14 cygnets in one photograph, so congratulations to the photographer here, who was Sue from Sale.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving to October, it's the grass trees after the bushfires at Cape Conran. I mentioned the bushfires at the outset and how they had an enormous impact on my community, but I want to assure people that the Cape Conran cabins are being rebuilt right now and there are plenty of accommodation options available at Marlo at Cape Conran.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November, the winning photograph came from Naomi, who took a shot of the Nowa Nowa trestle bridge right alongside the East Gippsland Rail Trail. The East Gippsland Rail Trail is the longest rail trail in my electorate. It runs from Bairnsdale to Orbost, almost 100 kilometres. Our government has provided almost $2 million to upgrade the trail. So we are very pleased to encourage more people to visit the East Gippsland Rail Trail. Finally, in December, there is a photo of the world-famous Mitchell River silt jetties. These are the longest silt jetties in Australia. In fact they're the longest in the world since the Mississippi Delta was impacted by Hurricane Katrina. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we encourage people to come to Gippsland, explore the diversity and see what magnificent options are available to them for a family holiday at any time of the year. For those who've already planned their holidays, I thank you for that; for those who are thinking about where they might spend their holidays this year, I encourage you to visit Gippsland.</span>

Today we received Kate Jenkins's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the standard: report on the Independent Review into Commonwealth Parliamentary Workplaces</span>. It found that one in three people employed in our parliamentary workplace has experienced some kind of harassment and that women experience sexual harassment and bullying at a higher rate than men. It's called out our environment, where power imbalances, gender inequality and exclusion, and a lack of accountability mean that too many people experience bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault.</span>

It must mark the end of a culture that has existed for far too long. It is time to change this parliament to make it a safe workplace for all women, and it's not just our parliament that needs to change; we've got to make our community and our homes safe for all women. We've got to shift gender roles in this country so that we are all equal. We owe that to Brittany Higgins. We owe it to all the staff and to all the members who contributed to this report. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an immense privilege to be elected to this place and to represent the people of Australia. The report notes the pride that so many people who are elected and who work in this place feel when they start their work. But it also makes it clear that that sense of pride doesn't last, because the standard that this parliament sets doesn't meet that expectation of service. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian women are rightly appalled by what they've heard about and seen in our parliament. Australian women deserve better than a parliament where women are assaulted and bullied. They deserve better than a parliament where allegations get swept under the carpet; are used as fodder for gossip or political gain; or are not thoroughly and independently investigated and ultimately end without consequences for perpetrators. What happens in this place matters. We are the workplace that Australians see on their TVs every night. The standards we set are the standards they see, and we can't change the country and our community if we can't change how we operate in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report is comprehensive and it must be considered in full, but I want to highlight a few areas that I think are crucial. As Kate Jenkins said today, there is a need for leadership. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Leaders set the tone and leadership from the top is particularly important to set clear expectations and role model safe and respectful behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the leaders in this parliament—the Prime Minister in particular—to take that leadership responsibility seriously. Don't just rely on the women in this place to make the change. We need the men to stand with us and make this change with us. We need you to be part of the leadership that drives the change that we need to see. The report recommends a code of conduct for parliamentarians and for parliamentarians' staff. It is ridiculous that, as elected representatives, we don't have a code of conduct that we adhere to. And, of course, it recommends an independent parliamentary services commission to make sure that there is an independent place where people can take complaints, where complaints are independently investigated and where standards are set and dealt with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I co-authored a book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Enough is Enough</span>, with my predecessor as the member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin. It drew on her extensive experience as a parliamentarian and my shorter experience as a parliamentarian, to talk about the change that needs to happen in this place to make it safe for women. Working on the book has meant that I've had many conversations with women across the country about what they think is happening in this place and what needs to happen. Too many of those conversations have been with women who thought they might want to be involved—they might want to run for office—but now feel like this is not a safe place for them to work. It is ridiculous that women look at us as a parliament and think, 'It's not safe; I don't want to work there,' and that we do not represent the diversity of our communities. Women and people from diverse communities should absolutely feel that they can be safe in this place. We need to improve that. Our parliament would benefit from diversity from both women and people from diverse communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a really difficult year for Australian women. Again I say thank you to Brittany Higgins, Grace Tame and all the other women around Australia who have led this really important conversation. Women started this year with anger and with hope that things will change. I know some feel disappointed that things haven't changed enough yet. We have to keep the fight up, and today must be the day that we say enough is enough. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">EN</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  Philosopher Hannah Arendt, one of the greatest thinkers of our time, said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I want to talk about the harmful impacts of vaccine mandates. I have received over 100,000 emails about vaccine mandates. Some are from people who have lost their jobs. Some are from people who are vaccinated but are wanting to register their opposition to governments forcing other people to be vaccinated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to the mainstream media line, the vast majority of people opposing such mandates are not anti-vaxxers. They are people who have had adverse reactions; who have suffered vaccine injury; who have lost their jobs and, as a result, lost their families; or who have watched their friends, family members and colleagues suffer as a result of those mandates. They are hardworking Aussies who do not believe anyone should be forced to get the jab in order to work or to access basic and essential services, let alone be ostracised from the wider community. People from all over the country have contacted my office to tell me about their stories. These are real people who are scared and suffering. They are police officers, nurses, doctors, paramedics, teachers, miners, small-business owners, mums and dads. They are your sisters, your brothers, your neighbours and your family members, and I want to give them a voice in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my constituents from Mackay is pregnant. She has now lost her job due to a workplace vaccine mandate and is in significant distress because, she says, she can't access doctor and midwife appointments in person because she is unvaccinated. She is not anti vaccination; she just wants to be sure of the long-term effects of the vaccine before she has it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are those on the verge of suicide or who have attempted suicide because of the stress of workplace vaccine mandates. I have had constituents tell my office they are seriously considering suicide, to the point where staff have had to refer people to Lifeline. I had a construction worker email my office from a hospital on a Sunday morning after he had attempted to take his own life. The week prior, he had lost his job because of a vaccine mandate, and as a result his wife had left him and taken the kids. He told my staffer that he had nothing left to live for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has been contacted by multiple local aviation firefighters who have raised concerns about the travelling public being placed at risk due to staff shortages because of impending vaccine mandates that have short-staffed airports of firefighters, including at my local airports in Mackay and Proserpine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also contacted by a Mackay psychologist who, despite having a blood clotting disorder, is unable to obtain a medical exemption. She wanted to continue working and support her clients of 30 via telehealth, but some bureaucrat has decided she should be vaccinated in order to sit in her own study and treat people over a computer screen. So now she is going to have to change careers after 30 years of service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also received emails from constituents who have had adverse reactions to vaccines. Yes, while they are rare, the fact is that they may happen. A young mum had heart palpitations and chest pains after the first dose of Pfizer and is now so scared get the second, but she has to if she wants to keep her job. How is that not coercion? She has to choose between paying her mortgage and putting food on the table for her kids or risking another adverse reaction which could be worse for her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These mandates are putting people under undue stress. These stories, these cries and these pleas for help are simply not being listened to. We should be listening. It is clearly state governments and private corporations in the main causing this harm, but it is Commonwealth data from the Australian Immunisation Register that is enabling that harm, as that data shows who is vaccinated or not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">State governments and private corporations might not be listening, but I am not in state parliament or on a private corporation board; I'm in the federal parliament. So I want the Australian government to listen by not allowing its data to be misused to cause such harm. Until we do, I am no longer listening to the government whips on how I should vote in this place. Instead, I'm voting with my own conscience on every bill. I'm not doing this to be difficult; I'm doing my job. I'm representing views of my constituents, serving the people and standing up for the vulnerable, and I call on all of us to listen. Listen to the pleas for help, the distress and the suffering. Vaccine mandates are unnecessary, they're cruel, and I fear they're causing a tear in the social fabric that will take many, many years to repair.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs WICKS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:00</span>):  As I was saying before, while I am no scientist, I do give deep consideration to some of the ethical and faith based issues with aspects of this legislation. I have really wrestled with a number of the concepts that are outlined in this bill, particularly given my own personal situation a number of years ago, which I outlined. I had to wrestle through that for a personal decision that I am very glad to have undergone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that more consideration needs to be given to some other aspects, including the potential permanent modification of what is called the human germ line. 'Germ line DNA' refers to the tissues derived from reproductive cells that eventually can become incorporated into every cell in the body of the offspring. This modification could potentially lead to potential for off-target effects such as addition in the wrong places. There are also concerns about these same  techniques being used for non-therapeutic purposes—for example, height or eye colour. While only one other country, the United Kingdom, has legalised mitochondrial donations—it did so in 2015—I understand that there are some concerns about this kind of manipulation in other countries in the world and that around 40 countries have signed a memorandum on any methods that edit the human germ line. It is for this reason that I believe that we should tread with great caution to ensure that robust safety measures and safeguards are in place to protect future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill establishes a staged approach to implementing the technology should this legislation be adopted. Under stage 1, donation would be legalised for certain research and training purposes and to support selection and licensing of a pilot program for impacted families. Under stage 2, mitochondrial donation would be permitted in clinical practice more broadly if the initial pilot program were to be successful. A regulatory framework will be established to ensure that this process is managed effectively and in line with community expectations. The role of the current Embryo Research Licensing Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council will be expanded under this bill to include licensing and oversight of research and training in this area.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Children born using this technology still have two biological parents: a mother and a father. Children will inherit characteristics and personality traits from their biological parents, as the female donor only provides healthy mitochondria. Donor rights and responsibilities will also be based largely on current regulations. This includes that mitochondrial donors would not be considered legal parents, in line with the current arrangements for sperm and egg donors under the Family Law Act 1975, and that children conceived by mitochondrial donation will have the right to apply for identifying information about their donor when they turn 18 years old. This bill aligns with other Australian laws preventing exploitation and incentives for donors and allows donor eggs to be provided voluntarily from family members, friends or individuals who agree to donate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Severe mitochondrial disease can have a really devastating impact and effect on families, including causing long-term ill health and poor quality of life. In Australia, around 56 children are born with a severe form of the disease each year. I want to acknowledge and welcome the advance in genetic science which gives all of us hope for a world without mitochondrial disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the intention of the bill and I believe that we must work to lower the risk of transmission of mitochondrial disease. However, as I have outlined in the House tonight, we need to: consider the implications of some of the techniques that could be potentially used to achieve successful mitochondrial donation; ensure that the frameworks needed to regulate this kind of technology are in place; and understand the impact it could create for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the concerns I have raised tonight about some aspects of this legislation, I intend to abstain from the second reading vote on this bill. But I will be supporting any sensible and carefully drafted amendments that seek to deal with some of the concerns I have raised, should they be moved in this place. I hope that there is a way through which considers some of the faith based issues that I and, no doubt, others will raise, and that others have raised with me in the community when I have spoken to people who are interested in this particular issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I thank the government for providing a conscience vote on a matter that is as deeply personal as this, and I also thank all members of the House for their thoughtful consideration of the matters we are debating tonight and for the very insightful contributions we have heard.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:06</span>):  I thank the member for Robertson for her contribution. I think the contributions of members on both sides of this debate have been very thoughtful and very considered. It really is the parliament at its best. We are having a conscience vote on an issue that I know is deeply personal for a lot of people. I want to say tonight that I know there are genuine views on both sides, with people in favour of this legislation and people who are concerned about this legislation. While I respect all those views I will be voting in favour of this legislation, the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021. I believe that if we have the opportunity to prevent the suffering of children, to extend their lives, we should take that opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that some people in the community have a concern that this is a slippery slide into designer babies, into choosing the genetic make-up of children in the future. I understand the member for Robertson's concerns. She was speaking about the different types of mitochondrial donation techniques, the maternal spindle transfer technique as compared with the pronuclear transfer technique. I have thought deeply about these issues and I genuinely believe that, with the pain, the suffering, the shortened life span and the illness suffered by many children who have a mitochondrial disease, the sadness of children's families and the impact on those families make these scientific advances worth pursuing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends existing legislation to make mitochondrial donation legal for research, training and human reproductive purposes. As others before me have explained, mitochondrial disease refers to a group of inherited conditions caused by mutations in a person's DNA impacting their mitochondria—the part of our cells that helps the body produce energy. When these cells don't function properly, the body can experience organ failure, serious illness and death, particularly when the mitochondrial disease affects high-energy-use organs like the heart and the brain. But, of course, there are a broad range of impacts that can be experienced by sufferers of these conditions. It's extremely serious. Children with severe cases suffer tragically shortened life spans, usually between three and 12 years. Currently there are no available cures. There is a lot of encouraging research into elements of treatment, but there is no cure. Prevention is, I believe, obviously something we should be aiming for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">About one baby a week is born with mitochondrial disease. That is one family every week who is getting the news that the life of their beautiful new baby is likely to be shorter and that there are likely to be significant health impacts during that shortened life. The aim of this bill is to give parents who are at risk of passing on this disease options to have biological children without those children carrying increased risks of these diseases. Mitochondrial donation involves creating an embryo through IVF using DNA from the prospective mother and father as well as healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor. It is worth restating, of course, that in Australia we are bound by an existing regime that ensures that that donation is made not for financial gain but altruistically. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill facilitates this change by changing existing legislation to ensure that it's no longer an offence for the purposes of reproduction and under relevant mitochondrial donation licenses to create a human embryo that (a) contains the genetic material of more than two people and (b) contains heritable changes to the genome. There are tightly established processes around this. The bill takes an approach that is staged and controlled, with the hope that the techniques will be safe and that there will be no unforeseen consequences in opening up this approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Macarthur, Dr Mike Freelander, has said, this isn't about allowing a free-for-all for genetic alterations; it's about providing strict legislative oversight to allow one or two clinics to begin trials. I want to congratulate the member for Macarthur, the member for Higgins and the others in this parliament who have been working in a very cooperative way to advance this bill. The minister for health, the shadow minister for health and the former shadow minister for health, Chris Bowen, have all been very supportive of progressing this issue. I understand that people of good faith will disagree with these changes, but it is my belief that, as long as we can establish proper safeguards, our priority should always be the health and welfare of children. No child would ever make the choice to be born with these conditions that can be so life limiting, and I think that if we have the opportunity of giving more children the chance of a life free from mitochondrial disease it is important that we take that opportunity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to Sean Murray, the CEO of the Mito Foundation. Sean came to me a few years ago, beginning the process of lobbying not just on this bill but on a range of better genetic testing for parents and a range of other changes that the Mito Foundation want to see. I want to thank Sean for explaining how important this change is, and I want to congratulate the Mito Foundation on the wonderful work they do: educating people about mitochondrial disease; talking to parents who are likely to have a child with a mitochondrial disease or who have had a child born with a mitochondrial disease; supporting those families; backing the research; fundraising to do more research on treatment and prevention; and setting up the Mito Registry, which allows sufferers of mitochondrial disease to register to be part of clinical trials to access new treatments and new medicines and to be part of other studies. The Mito Foundation have obviously been championing this legislation and doing amazing work, both in their lobbying and in the fundraising they need to do to keep going. Their Bloody Long Walk was held just recently. I know that it's a very difficult environment for fundraising at the moment, but I want to congratulate the Mito Foundation on the fundraising that they have achieved and congratulate the people who have been involved in that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sean told me about the challenges facing people affected by this condition and how it has impacted generations of his family. So, as well as thanking him for sharing his story and thanking the Mito Foundation for the work they do, I want to thank the brilliant doctors, nurses and other health professionals that support children and some adults who are suffering mitochondrial diseases. I want to also thank the researchers who give people hope for treatment and cure. And I want to thank all of those families, in particular, who have been campaigning for this change—Sean Murray and the Hood family, Maeve's parents—whose advocacy over so many years has resulted in this bill. The reason I will support it is that, if we can prevent children being born with a condition that shortens their lives and comes with pain and suffering, I believe that we should. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:16</span>):  I intend to speak only briefly tonight on this bill, the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021. I do think it is important, particularly in the context of a conscience vote, that members indicate to their communities where their views lie in relation to this matter so they understand the vote they are about to take. I'm delighted that this has been the subject of a conscience vote. I can think of a few other issues where I would like to see a conscience vote as well over the weeks ahead, but it is an appropriate matter for us to be considering in this way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to thank the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, for his work to make sure that the entire parliament has been able to consider what is obviously a very significant issue. I know his shadow minister has done the same. I particularly want to highlight the work and the contributions during this debate of the member for Higgins and the member for Macarthur. We are blessed to have two such eminent doctors and medical specialists within our ranks, and I think it improves our capacity and the quality of debate in this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to give an acknowledgement to Professor Carolyn Sue, who is the executive director of the Kolling Institute of Medical Research at the Royal North Shore Hospital. Carolyn spoke to me about this legislation, or the concept of mitochondrial donation, many, many months ago. She is one of the leaders in the field of understanding mitochondrial disease, she is a strong advocate for this bill and she is a very impressive medical professional, and I am grateful for the dedication that she has brought to this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, whilst I understand the reservations some members of this House have, the issue is very clear. This is about providing a new opportunity that didn't previously exist for so many Australians who have mitochondrial disease, and I particularly think of the children and their parents who encounter the devastating diagnosis that mitochondrial disease is present. It is a disease that affects people in different ways. It affects different organs of the body. The mitochondria are the battery packs of our cells. The manifestation of a genetic mutation does affect people differently, but the prognosis for many is so devastating. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As chair of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, what I do know is that rare diseases like this can scar families forever, both because of the level of care that's required and often because the prognosis can be so grim. During my time as chair, I have met with, heard from and read the writings of so many parents and so many medical professionals who have highlighted the important potential that we have to start to address some of those rare diseases that have eluded medical science to date. Mitochondrial disease is one of those. It is extraordinary that we are debating this bill today because it reflects just how far medical science has progressed over the last decade. It reflects the work that's being done in so many areas, with genomics and precision medicine. It has opened an opportunity to improve the quality of life and prevent serious illness in newborns and to ensure that parents can go forward knowing that they're not risking having children that might suffer these ailments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in a circumstance where 120,000 Australians carry a mitochondrial mutation, where 56 children each year are born with mitochondrial mutations and potential for disease, this bill makes sense. I particularly want to acknowledge the testimony that we heard in this place from the member for Mayo about her own family circumstances, about her own grandchild. That was incredibly moving. I spoke to her afterwards. When you see the photos of that baby, that infant, knowing what he will be deprived of in the years ahead, it just makes sense that we pass this legislation today. Yes, there are ethical issues, but this represents a very cautious approach. It represents a staged approach. It is world leading. The UK is the only other nation that's been down this path before us in the way that we're proposing. But I do have a high degree of trust in our medical experts and our medical scientists. Therefore, it will give me a great deal of pleasure to provide the hope to so many families that supporting this bill will entail. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">:</span>  I rise to speak on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021. Parenthood is a gift. It's the most precious gift, having a child with the characteristics and personality quirks of yourself and your partner, and when a couple is unable to have a healthy baby, we must, as a community, do all we can to assist. Under Medicare we provide access to IVF technologies, we have allowed surrogate arrangements, and once a child is born we do all we can to make sure that that child can have the very best medical care and start to their life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The quality of a life lived does not determine the value that is inherent in it. All life, at all stages, has inherent dignity, value and worth, and it is critical that, as we seek to debate these difficult issues that cut to the heart of our morals and values, we keep that at the front of our minds at all times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial disease is an insidious, incurable and often fatal condition that can be caused by over 250 different gene abnormalities. Women with mitochondrial disease can pass the disease to their children, and the mechanisms for doing so are multifaceted and complex. We know that the disease can be passed on through the mitochondrial DNA, but it can also be passed on through a woman's germline DNA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that mitochondrial donation does not cure mitochondrial disease, and it's not effective for asymptomatic women who are mitochondrial disease carriers, or those with DNA mutations—which account for half of all mitochondrial disease cases—or for those instances where new genetic mutations occur spontaneously in the embryo. However, genetic manipulation through mitochondrial donation may allow some women with known mitochondrial disease to have a genetically related baby which may be free of mitochondrial disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the gift of parenthood in such circumstances—or indeed in any circumstances—should not override the rights of the child. This is a complex genetic manipulation process, and all of the associated ethical concerns should be addressed through the use of a donor egg or existing egg and sperm screening techniques. But it's understandable that this would not address the natural desire of a couple to have a child that is genetically related to both parents. I can understand that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to clarify that it's important for me, and I expect for us all, that we provide hope wherever it's possible, to relieve suffering and to improve human life. Yet, at times, we need to look at the research and the scientific and medical techniques and procedures, and decide whether it's a path that we should go down. These are not just personal medical decisions. These decisions have long-term consequences for families and for generations should there be any unintended or unforeseen consequences of the procedures. These decisions go to the heart of how we protect our common human genetic legacy. I'm not a scientist, and I've found it challenging to absorb all of the concepts and nuances of this scientific research. I'll support a number of amendments in order to ensure this bill gives the greatest protections to the most vulnerable in our society. I appreciate the member for Menzies and his conviction in bringing forward these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The banning of sex selection for embryos is the first amendment to this bill that I will vote in favour of. It is vital to the equality of our society that we do not seek to prioritise or favour children of one sex over another. I do worry that the ability of couples to select children on the basis of sex will see entrenchment of gender imbalance amongst us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I'll be supporting the amendments to ban post-fertilisation techniques such as PNT. I cannot support a process whereby a zygote is intentionally created but then is not given the opportunity for that life to continue and to flourish. The technique of choice in the UK takes a fertilised egg from the mother. The DNA is extracted and put into a fertilised egg from the donor and the father which has the DNA removed. This is the pronuclear transfer method. In this case, one embryo has been created which is not 'for the purpose of achieving a pregnancy in a particular woman', as is required by current legislation. To fertilise an egg and create the conditions for life only for the purpose of destruction is not something that sits comfortably with me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I will support amendments to improve the reporting frameworks and time lines and to see an increase in clinical trials before moving ahead with these techniques. It is vital that, if this bill is to pass and the opportunities for mitochondrial donation begin to take place, the science and all the protections for those who will be taking part, including any potential children, are as robust and rigorous as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've researched the issue as extensively as I can and considered the correspondence I've received from various advocacy organisations. I've come to a conclusion based on the research and my own conscience. I thank all of those who have contacted me on this particular matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill reverses the longstanding prohibition on heritable human genetic manipulation. Mitochondrial donation allows changes to the heritable genetic information of a child and will affect that child, their children, their grandchildren, their great-grandchildren and the many generations to come. That's why it's important to make sure that the provisions of this bill are considered with the utmost care and diligence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank my colleagues in this chamber who have taken the time to wrestle with these vexed issues. Though we may have arrived at different outcomes, all should be commended for the respectful way we've been able to engage in this complex and difficult debate. This displays the best of our democratic process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I do have some reservations around the implications of this bill, should the amendments brought forward that I will support be voted down, I will not take any action to prevent the passage of this bill. I'm actually confident this bill will pass, and I hope that those whom this bill seeks to assist find the comfort and help that it looks to bring. I hope that it's successful. I hope that we make technological advances so more parents can receive the gift of parenthood, which I have had the privilege to receive.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:27</span>):  I begin my remarks on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 by quoting the Australian government Department of Health website on mitochondrial donation. The very first line says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mitochondrial donation is an IVF-based assisted reproductive technology. It has the potential—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and I stress the word 'potential'—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">to prevent mitochondrial disease in babies born to mothers who may otherwise pass on the disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, as other speakers have already pointed out, enables a staged process for mitochondrial donation. The process does not provide a cure for those children already born with the disease, nor does it prevent future children from being born with the disease. The two-stage process, however, does follow a similar process commenced in the UK in 2015. The two-stage process will firstly allow the selection and licensing of a clinical trial that could run over a 10-year period, whereby mitochondrial donation will be provided to selected families—again, I stress the words 'selected families'. The very selection process itself is a matter that could be argued about as well. f successful, the procedure would then be made available more broadly across Australia. It would be made more broadly across Australia if it were embraced and adopted by each of the state and territory governments, and we've got no certainty about that either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation has been the subject of extensive community consultation and review by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. I note that in that review the committee did not form a recommendation; they simply presented their evidence from the inquiry. I have to say I thought it was very good evidence from all parties that made a submission in respect to this very matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation also invokes several human rights including the right to health, the right to life, the obligation to consider the best interest of the child, the right to privacy and the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Again, we could debate each and every one of those matters with respect to this bill, but I don't wish to do that; I simply raise the point that there are several other matters that are associated with this proposal. I don't believe that anyone in this parliament wants to see children or their parents suffer in any way. I think that that's been very clear from each of the contributions that I have listened to in the course of this debate—and, I might say, I've listened to just about everyone's contribution to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Preventing suffering is the objective of this legislation. The illness that mitochondrial donation hopes to prevent is complex, and the procedure proposed is untested and controversial. I believe the UK trials are the only documented trials in the world. There may be others taking place that we don't know about, and I suspect that that may well be the case, but, in terms of what we do know about, the UK trials, which were legislated in 2015, some six years ago, are the only ones that we have to rely on. My understanding is that they commenced at Newcastle University in 2018. To date, we have had no information about the success or otherwise of those trials. So it makes you wonder: 'Why is that? Why has no information come out of that research over the last three-year period?' Indeed, I'm not even aware of whether there have been any successful births as a result of the trials that have taken place there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A paper prepared by three academics from Newcastle University and published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Science and Society</span> in August 2020 concludes that mitochondrial transfer is a potential cure—again, I stress the words 'potential cure'—for many diseases but proof of efficacy and safety is still lacking. I want to quote only a section of that paper because I think it's very relevant to this issue. The paper is headed <span style="font-style:italic;">Mitochondrial transplantation—a possible</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> therapeutic for mitochondrial dysfunction?</span> It goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The inference, stretching back to experiments in the 1980s, suggests that it may be possible—at least for careful injection of freshly isolated mitochondria … but the efficiency of this process is extremely poor, and without a strong selection for the injected mtDNA and time to facilitate the selection, the overall effect on cell function will be minimal. Irrespective, mitochondria, particularly those that have lost their membrane potential, are constantly turned over in the cell inferring that if transplanted mitochondria had any benefit, this may be just relatively short-lived.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Considering all these caveats, it is difficult to see how transplantation could lead to long-term benefits directly from the transplanted mitochondria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authors of that paper are not opposed to the trials. I make it clear that their comments are in no way implying that they oppose what is happening at Newcastle University. It begs the question: given that we've got the trials in the UK and given that only people who are at very high risk of passing a serious mitochondrial disease to their children are eligible for the treatment in the UK, why is it that we have no information, and why is it that there is such a restriction? Why is it that only people who have a very high risk of passing on a serious mitochondrial disease are eligible for the trial?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It tells me clearly that there are very genuine concerns about even the trials in Newcastle. I have no doubt that they are trying to manage their process as well as they can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With those comments, I am left with these questions. Firstly, why is it that no information has been released about the UK trials? I would have thought that if the trials had been operating successfully they would want that information to be released. However, there might be a good reason for that. Secondly, why is that no other country has legitimised this procedure? I have no doubt that there are researchers right around the world who would be aware of this procedure, yet no other country seems to be following that path. Why is that? I have not heard anyone making a contribution to this debate explain why that is the case. What research is currently underway, both here in Australia and elsewhere in the world, to cure children born with mitochondrial disease? I've heard very little about that. It seems to me that our focus should be as much on the children who are already born as it is on those whom we might try to help in the future. Finally, what options are available to parents who live with the risk of mitochondrial disease right now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some caveats requested by GeneEthics in their submission to members of parliament, to whom I have no doubt they would have written, and to others. They said, I think quite properly, that if the legislation is to pass they would like to be assured that there would at least be things like annual reports to parliament, standalone laws so that decisions aren't made simply by regulation, proper counselling services for people who are going to be engaged in the trials and clear lines of accountability for those who are conducting the trials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, we haven't heard from anyone about the potential risks or adverse effects of this procedure. Again, most of the speakers have come into the chamber, quite rightly wanting to support whatever it is that we can do to avoid children being born with mitochondrial disease, but I haven't heard of any medical report in respect of the risks of the proposed procedure. I have listened to the passionate speeches of other members, including that of the member for Mayo, whom you yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Zimmerman, referred to. I received an email from a family in my own electorate, who lost their nine-month-old daughter to mitochondrial disease, asking me to support this legislation. I have no doubt that they would have gone through a terrible period. I personally know of infants who have died from an incurable illness, and I have felt the heartache that it caused their parents. I've read in full the paper from Oliver Hervir, which was circulated by the member for Macarthur and to which he referred. It's a very good paper. I think it tries to summarise the issue very, very well. But my role in this parliament is to make evidence based decisions that ensure that the unintended consequences don't outweigh the possible benefits that we are seeking. Nor do I want to give false hope to desperate parents whilst possibly diverting research dollars away from other cures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do welcome the two-stage approach that is proposed in this legislation, and I certainly welcome the highly regulated and reviewed clinical trials process that is being proposed. There is no question that, if this legislation goes through, it gives me a high level of confidence and comfort that there will be adequate safeguards put into the trial process. But the unanswered questions still remain, and to my mind there is still no clear way forward. Neither approval nor rejection of this legislation, to my mind, provides certainty. I will comfortably accept the will of this parliament, but I am still to be convinced that this legislation is driven more by compassion and hope than it is by proven science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish with a quotation from a submission made by the Robinson Research Institute in Adelaide, which is a branch of the University of Adelaide. I'm familiar with the Robinson Research Institute; I've been through their research facilities. The facilities are very impressive, and the people who work within the institute are very impressive. The Robinson Research Institute is a medical research institute that comprehensively addresses how to give all children the healthiest start in life. I'll quote part of their submission to the Senate committee. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In summary, our primary concerns with the currently proposed Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform are that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1) it allows genome modification in human embryos and</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2) the possibility that children conceived in this manner could have developmental defects because the technology has not been tested and refined to a level appropriate for clinical use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We believe that it is essential to answer the above questions by conducting further research before Mitochondrial Donation be permitted for use to treat carriers of mtDNA disease.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Robinson Research Institute, as I said, is a credible body that I have a lot of faith in. That is their view, and, unless I hear differently, that will be my view.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:40</span>): I intend to make a short contribution to this debate, and I have wrestled, as so many members have, with the issues that underlie it. Mitochondrial disease refers to a group of largely inherited genetic conditions that can significantly lower an individual's health and life expectancy and that may be fatal. Mitochondrial disease is difficult to diagnose. Currently, there's no cure, and treatment options are limited largely to the management of symptoms. Severe mitochondrial disease can have a devastating effect on families, including the premature death of children; painful, debilitating suffering; long-term ill health; and poor quality of life. The common factor among mitochondrial disease is that the mitochondria are unable to completely burn food and oxygen to generate energy which is essential for normal cell function. This is a disease that's often inherited. Symptoms might include poor growth, developmental delays and muscle weaknesses. The risk of developing serious illness due to mitochondrial disease is considered to be from one in 5,000 to one in 10,000. One in 200 Australians are estimated to be predisposed to mitochondrial disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial donation involves the removal of nuclear DNA from a patient's egg containing faulty mitochondria and inserting it into a healthy donor egg which has had its nuclear DNA removed. This can be done before the egg is fertilised or post fertilisation. The fertilised egg is transferred into the mother exactly as per current IVF practice. As the nuclear DNA is retained, the unique genetic information that makes us who we are and determines what we look like is passed on from mother to child but the mitochondrial defects are not. Mitochondrial donation is currently prohibited in Australia, as the current act prohibits the creation of human embryos by fertilisation with genetic material from more than two people. The only country in the world where it's currently legal is the UK. What the bill before the House, the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021, will do is amend the existing Commonwealth legislation to allow for mitochondrial donation to be introduced into Australia for research and human reproductive purposes.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maeve's Law is named after five-year-old Maeve, who lives with Leigh syndrome. Legalising mitochondrial donation would allow impacted Australians to have genetically related children without the risk of them inheriting mitochondrial DNA defects which would drastically limit their lives. Aside from the devastating physical and emotional impact on patients and their families, many patients have repeated and prolonged hospital visits and are unable to work, and may need full-time care. Whilst mitochondrial donation techniques result in an heritable change to the genome, they do not involve gene editing of either the nuclear DNA or the mitochondrial DNA, which has been expressly prohibited in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, donor eggs may be provided voluntarily from family members, friends or individuals who agree to donate eggs or have eggs that are in excess of their own needs from IVF clinics. A two-stage implementation approach is proposed to introduce mitochondrial donation in Australia. Stage 1: mitochondrial donation would initially be legalised for certain research or training purposes and to support selection and licensing of a pilot program to deliver mitochondrial donation to impacted families. Stage 2: mitochondrial donations would be permitted in clinical practice more broadly, depending on the outcomes and an evaluation of the initial pilot program. The role of the current Embryo Research Licensing Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council would be expanded under the bill to include the licensing and oversight of research and training licences, a clinical licence for the initial pilot stage and future clinical practice licences using mitochondrial donation techniques. The use of specified mitochondrial donation techniques would be subject to strict licensing and regulatory conditions which would be overseen by the Embryo Research Licensing Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council, and individuals seeking to access the program would require approval from the ERLC based on clinical recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the ethical and other issues that have been raised by this bill, I note that my friend the member for Menzies has circulated some amendments. Some of those amendments I intend to support and some I won't. I particularly want to support the amendments relating to prohibiting these techniques for using these technologies for sex selection. I don't believe that assisted reproductive technology should be used for sex selection. I also support proposals to improve reporting requirements from the National Health and Medical Research Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've considered the ethical implications of this proposal more broadly and have great respect for my friends who have serious ethical concerns about mitochondrial donation. Many of those ethical concerns are aligned with views about IVF and egg donation more broadly. I should say, both from a theological perspective and also from a personal perspective, I don't have an issue with IVF or egg donation, and it would be hypocritical for me to say that I had a view with assisted reproductive technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge my friend the member for Boothby, who's in the chamber tonight, for the wonderful work that she has done in this place on endometriosis. Like the member for Boothby, my wife suffers from endometriosis, and we would not have our son, James, who's now 3½ nor our daughter who is due next year without the benefit of assisted reproductive technology. I, therefore, find myself in support of the use of this technology more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that I should say is in considering these matters I sought the advice of Rabbi Gab Krebs of Masada Synagogue, an Orthodox rabbi and a great scholar. In fact, he's due to become the rabbi of Moriah College next year. He consulted Jewish authorities in Israel as well on these issues, and I note the words of Lord Robert Winston, the distinguished biologist, bioethicist and Orthodox Jew. The perspective of Orthodox Judaism on mitochondrial donation, as is the perspective on IVF and egg donation more broadly, is that there is no particular prohibition in Orthodox Judaism in relation to the use of these technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interesting debates in Orthodox Judaism about the question of mitochondrial DNA relate so often, as these questions do in the Halakah, to the question of identity. If you have a non-Jewish mother who has donated the mitochondria, is the child Jewish? Or: if the non-Jewish mother is the egg donor and the Jewish mother is donating the mitochondria, because a child is a Jewish under in Orthodox Judaism if their mother is Jewish—this has raised some interesting Halakah debates which are not entirely settled, and I'm sure will continue to be debated as these matters go on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having considered this matter and thought about the ethical implications of my own faith tradition, I have come to the view that, subject to some of the member for Menzies' amendments which I support succeeding, the bill should be broadly supported.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:47</span>):  I come to the dispatch box on the debate on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 with the necessary degree of humility. I was a lawyer before coming to this place, not a scientist. Everything I know about the science of this is based on what I've read of scholars far more learned in these subject matters than I. I'm also not a person who lives with the disease. Every bit of personal knowledge that I have about mitochondrial disease has been gleaned from listening to the exceptional debates that have been given by colleagues in the chamber over the course of the last three days, the things that I've read and from consultations with local constituents who've been forthcoming with their views and personal experiences, some of which I'll reflect upon in my contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill, if passed, will legalise the donation of healthy mitochondrial DNA into egg cells. It'll allow the use of a safe and highly effective medical procedure, which has now been proven overseas for a number of years. It was first legalised in the United Kingdom in 2017. The US also allows the procedure, although under more limited circumstances. But, most importantly, and the thing that is bearing upon my consideration of the issue, it's going to help to ease needless pain and suffering, and that has been determinative of my approach to the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondria are the cell structure that makes our daily miracles possible. They have their own DNA structure separate from the nucleic DNA that determines what we look like. I didn't know about these things until I researched the background to this bill, and I'm a better person for it. Mitochondrial DNA, on the other hand, is the power grid for human existence. Laughing, running and even sleeping—none of this would be possible but for the energy that mitochondria provides at the molecular level, so a minor defect in mitochondrial DNA can cause major health issues. It is often very fatal for a newborn babies. It also causes a wide range of complications for sufferers old and young—stroke, deafness, blindness, even childhood dementia. Those with a defective gene can live for years without even knowing it until the debilitating symptoms begin to appear. There is no cure. The best hope to defeat this disease is its prevention. That is the hope contained within this bill, and it is why I will be supporting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with the modified IVF technology with which so many Australian families are already familiar, this bill will allow doctors to replace mutated mitochondrial DNA with healthy DNA. In doing so, it will break the chain of hereditary gene defects and begin the march towards eliminating mitochondrial disease. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that, like other diseases, it could be eradicated. In Australia, this would save 56 babies a year from either premature death or a lifetime of pain or needless limitation. It would save the families of those children the anguish that raising a child with this condition bears. It would reduce just a little bit of the pressure on carers by reducing the demand for the resources that they lovingly, without a grudge, provide to support them. This is exactly what this parliament should be doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge those who argue these clear benefits must be weighed against the religious, ethical and moral convictions, and the cost and benefit. The medical procedure that this bill would allow involves the transfer of healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor egg into the egg of a mother carrying an embryo. As such, it requires a donor egg, which, as various submitters have argued, means the creation of that egg for the specific purpose of carrying out that medical procedure—that is, not of conception but of carrying out this procedure. Submissions from many faith groups and others have raised questions about the ethics of this. We cannot and should not blithely dismiss or disregard these objections. I respect their convictions on those issues, but I personally am of the belief that the benefits to those 56 families of the 56 infants born with mitochondrial disease every year outweigh these ethical considerations and concerns. Those babies and their families deserve a chance at a life without the pain and limitations that mitochondrial disease brings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If some choose not to take up the medical option that the passing of this bill would provide because of their personal convictions, I understand that. But I don't believe that it is the role of this parliament to prevent that option being available to those families who know with some certainty that they will be passing this disease on to their children. This point was brought home to me loud and clear earlier when I took the time to discuss the issue with a constituent of mine, Rhonda Murray. Rhonda has faced mitochondrial disease across generations of her family. I want to thank her for her advocacy. She told me of how the disease robs the body of energy and how it can strike vital organs at any time without warning. Strokes, hearing impairment and severe fatigue can suddenly develop with little or no warning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rhonda's mother was 40 years of age before she began showing the crippling symptoms of fatigue and multiple strokes. Once the symptoms take hold, there is no turning back; they are there for life and they are untreatable. When symptoms occur in babies, the results are serious and often fatal: difficulty breathing, difficulty eating and listlessness. Rhonda herself has inherited the genetic mutation that causes mitochondrial disease and has, in turn, passed it onto her two daughters. She's fighting hard, along with her family and others, to get this bill passed. She's not doing it for her own sake—her fate is sealed—but so that her daughters can one day go on to have healthy children of their own in the knowledge that they won't be passing that disease onto another generation of Murrays. Hearing Rhonda's advocacy on this issue on behalf of her future grandchildren was powerful, to say the least. So I'll be voting on the bill and I'll be considering the amendments that have been foreshadowed. I understand that the member for Menzies takes a different view to me on these. But I know him to be a thoughtful contributor to debates in this place so I'll be considering the amendments that he moves on their merits, together with those that have been foreshadowed by other speakers in this debate and moved by government members or others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a day on which this parliament has been occupied by some of the worst behaviour that we've seen this year and—can I put it without passing judgement—some of the less wonderful debates, I think it is a pleasure for all members of this place to be closing the proceedings on a debate where we've seen some of the very best contributions, even from those who I strongly disagree with. In my view, a conscience vote in this parliament always brings out the very best. Some of the debates that I've heard in this debate and in other conscience debates in this place have been of a very high calibre indeed. It just goes to show that our democracy is robust and it brings forth some of the very best and the very worst that we see in public discourse in this place and outside of this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be voting for the bill. I thank members of this place for the opportunity, and all of those who've put their effort into ensuring the bill comes before this house before the close of this session this year.</span>

                    <a href="HK5" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:56</span>):  The Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 amends the Prohibition of Human Cloning for Reproduction Act 2002 and the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002 in order to make mitochondrial donation legal in Australia. The purpose of the bill is to allow women to have a biological child in a way that minimises the risk of transmission of the effects of mitochondrial disease. As many members have pointed out, it's a disease for which there is no cure, regrettably, and it leaves children suffering from seizures, from fatigue, from multiple organ failure, from heart problems and, in severe cases, from death. Here in Australia it's estimated that around 56 children are born with a severe form of this disease each year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many members have spoken of their hope that these novel techniques will alleviate this disease. Our emotional reactions are valid. To wish to relieve suffering is a very human reaction and a very human desire. However, for me there are other considerations that need to be weighed in this discussion, and in coming to a decision in what is a conscience vote, or free vote, in this place. This debate has been conducted with civility and decorum. In coming to my decision I recognise and respect that there are a range of views, each informed by a desire to respond in the best possible way to the circumstances. It's in that spirit that I offer my contribution this evening. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe we need to understand what this bill will do. First, the bill legalises, under specific conditions, practices which less than 20 years ago were prohibited by this same parliament as unacceptable and attracted custodial penalties. These include creating, for the purpose of reproduction, a human embryo that (a) contains genetic material of more than two people and (b) contains heritable changes to the genome. That in itself is not an argument for change; I'm simply pointing out that something that this parliament regarded as unacceptable not that long ago is now being proposed to be changed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, there is no evidence to date that these practices will either cure or effectively treat mitochondrial disease. There is currently much research and clinical practice devoted to looking for a cure or for a treatment for ways of alleviating the condition. Genetic technologies—in particular, gene editing—hold out hope in the future for a genuine cure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the practices foreshadowed in this bill are unlike any existing form of health care or artificial reproduction. Some proponents suggest that the procedures are simply extensions of existing practices, such as organ transplantation and assisted reproductive technologies. I contend that this is not so. In organ transplantation, DNA is not passed onto future generations. In current reproductive technologies, neither human eggs nor human embryos are modified in the radical ways proposed in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, mitochondrial donation is yet to be proven safe and efficacious in human research. The US Food and Drug Administration has taken the view that all forms of mitochondrial donation, whether using male or female embryos, constitute germline editing and has maintained its prohibition on clinical trials for this reason. The contribution of DNA, whether mitochondrial or nuclear, to the genetic make-up of a child is yet to be understood. Mitochondrial DNA, even in small amounts, may contribute to personal characteristics in a child in ways that are not yet recognised. It is not yet known whether DNA from the nucleus or the mitochondria will in fact be compatible. Nor is it known whether, given that up to three per cent of the mother's mitochondria is likely to be passed on, the disease will not rebound in future generations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much reference has been made to the UK, where this research has been underway for some five to six years. There's one clinic there which is authorised. We are told that 21 couples have received treatment, but there is no data about the effectiveness of that treatment, even in a de-identified way, that's available to us. The member for Makin, in his contribution tonight, referred to a paper written by a number of the scientists involved in those trials in the UK, and even those scientists who are proponents of this technique still say that this is simply something that still has potential and that safety and efficacy is yet to be proven. There have been reports of possible use in Mexico and Ukraine, but there are no verifiable, respected reports in the medical or scientific literature. And, as I said, the techniques remain banned in other areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I have a number of concerns or reservations. The first relates to the mitochondrial donation techniques. The bill prescribes five techniques, and these are set out in a diagrammatic form on page 67 of the explanatory memorandum. Two techniques involve the transfer of material between eggs—that is, the maternal spindle transfer and the germinal vesicle transfer. Three other techniques involve the transfer of material between zygotes or embryos—namely, pronuclear transfer, first polar body transfer and second polar body transfer. These three techniques necessarily involve the destruction of the zygote or the embryo. I note in passing that, under the bill, only two techniques—namely, maternal spindle transfer and pronuclear transfer—are permitted for the clinical trial licence phase. Of these two techniques which are permitted if the bill passes in the forthcoming future, pronuclear transfer involves the destruction of the zygote or the embryo. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, my concern is about the destruction of the zygote or the embryo, one of the lines of techniques which would be permitted by this bill. Accordingly, I foreshadow that I will move amendments at the detailed stage to remove from the bill the techniques that involve the destruction of a zygote or an embryo. This would allow the research to continue using gametes. Given the experimental nature of what is being proposed, the absence of any data from the UK and the lack of any evidence that these techniques will achieve what is being proposed, it is entirely reasonable, I submit, to ban the deliberate destruction of the zygote or the embryo at this time. Moreover, we are told that the early stages of research could take a decade. If so, there is a case for the less destructive techniques to be explored first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second reservation relates to the provision for the availability of sex selection under this bill. Under proposed section 28Q, after attending pretreatment counselling, a patient and her spouse, if any, can request to have only male embryos selected for implantation where it is deemed safe and practical to do so. This is notionally because it is said that there is less chance of transferring defective mitochondria to a male baby—an admission, I note in passing, that in itself is about the experimental, uncertain nature of these techniques. I note that the UK legislation does not appear to allow sex selection. Accordingly, I propose in the amendments being circulated to remove that provision from the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My third area of concern relates to reporting requirements. I believe that in something as significant as this—undertaking research which has not been undertaken in this country before and has possibly only been undertaken in the UK—there should be some annual reporting to the parliament about the research which is undertaken. I don't believe that a review after seven years is sufficient to inform either the parliament or the people of Australia as to what's occurring in relation to this research, if it occurs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My fourth area of concern relates to a technique being proven before it's used in general clinical practice. These matters are contained in the amendments which have been or will be circulated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I understand from discussions that I've had today that two of these areas of concern will be addressed in government amendments—namely, the concerns about sex selection and the concerns about the reporting. If that is the case, when we reach the consideration in detail stage of the debate on this bill, obviously I won't proceed with my amendments in relation to these issues. However, I foreshadow that I will move to put the amendments in relation to the other matters. If these matters are not addressed tomorrow by the amendments which the government is proposing, obviously I will put to the House all four sets of amendments in relation to this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like other speakers, I have given much consideration to these matters. Indeed, it's not the first time that I have considered some of these matters. I was here, as some members were, almost 20 years ago, when this whole area of cloning and stem cell research was considered by the parliament. Indeed, I chaired the committee that looked into it prior to the legislation being passed. My position is consistent with that which I held at that stage. It's one that, if these amendments were passed, would actually allow the research to continue, but without the destruction to embryos or zygotes and in a way which would not permit, for the first time in this country, sex selection to occur. I commend the amendments to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  I rose in this chamber last week to call to the House's attention one of my constituents, a 16-year-old boy named Harvey McKeever, who is an NDIS participant. Harvey became a quadriplegic in February of this year, after a motorcycle accident on the family farm. He spent six months in hospital and finally returned home in September. Harvey requires significant rehabilitation and round-the-clock care in order to maintain his health. When I spoke to the House regarding Harvey's struggles with receiving adequate care and assistance from the NDIS, Harvey was awaiting the result of his fourth NDIS internal review. The NDIS has repeatedly denied requests from Harvey and his family regarding the items necessary for his health care and physical wellbeing. These included an electrical stimulation bike that the Royal Children's Hospital has deemed essential for Harvey's health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, Harvey's mum, Renae, informed my office that the fourth internal review had been unsuccessful. After all the requests that have been denied, four internal reviews, countless reports and recommendations, Harvey and his family have been left in the same uncomfortable position, with the same inadequate level of care that they were requesting a review of. Harvey, his mum, Renae, and their entire family want nothing more than for Harvey to live comfortably at home, for his health to be maintained and for him to maintain the dignity that he deserves. It is exactly the purpose for which the NDIS was created. Sadly, this Morrison government has ripped the NDIS apart. The NDIS now seems incapable of fulfilling its most basic purpose. Harvey and his family, after four internal reviews have already been completed, are now being asked to complete a new set of independent assessments. The relevance and the necessity of this are just not clear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I call on the hapless minister and the CEO of the NDIS to consider very carefully whether they are fulfilling the burdens of their roles correctly and properly. The way it looks to me, to Harvey and his family, to our electorate and to the Australian people is that the minister and the CEO have both failed to do their jobs. No minister with any ounce of integrity would allow this to happen on their watch. The minister has failed in her job, failed Australians living with disability. If she had any decency, she would get on the phone and sort this now or resign. The NDIS is routinely wasting vast sums of taxpayers' money by requesting more reports, again and again, not just for Harvey but for so many who have contacted my office. Australians with disabilities are being forced to navigate drawn-out, bureaucratic and ineffective processes. The Morrison government's stance on compulsory independent assessments and the new 'God power' provisions is an absolute disgrace. Harvey and his family must now request a fifth internal review. How much does this government want them to bear? If it's unsuccessful, they'll have to take their matter to the AAT. The NDIS needs urgent reform, and on this issue the Morrison government has failed miserably. Only an Albanese government can be trusted to reform the NDIS and support Australians living with disability. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">red)</span></span>

I first want to acknowledge so many people across the electorate who rolled up their sleeves and went to get vaccinated at the earliest possible opportunity. I'm very proud of the fact that, by early November this year, three local government areas wholly or partly within my electorate—Hornsby, Ku-ring-gai and Willoughby—had all exceeded 90 per cent double-dose rates. Of course I want to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of our local healthcare professionals in so many ways. I acknowledge Dr Hiramanek and her team at the Roseville vaccination centre, where I personally was pleased to have two AstraZeneca shots. I know that many, many others in the electorate of Bradfield were pleased to be vaccinated at facilities, pharmacies and doctors' surgeries throughout the electorate. I acknowledge particularly Helen and Sabina at Lindfield Pharmacy, Kelly at Taylors Pharmacy in Turramurra and, of course, all of the other pharmacists and GPs across the electorate. I acknowledge our hospitals and institutions, particularly the San in Wahroonga and Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital. People in Bradfield can be very confident about the quality of medical care available to them at these widely respected institution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge our teachers and students who kept going through this very difficult period. I was struck one day when I joined two classes online, a year 9 science class at St Ives High School and a year 11 class at Barker College, by the way both the teacher and the students were interacting and getting on with their work in the unusual circumstances of doing lessons over Zoom. I thank all of the ancillary and other services that performed such a vital role. Meals on Wheels Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby continued to operate throughout pandemic ensuring that freshly cooked meals were delivered to senior Australians across the electorate in a COVID-safe manner. I want to thank manager Nick Eudale and his team of volunteers. They've delivered over 100,000 meals this year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank our local SES units who've been on standby to deal with emergencies and challenges when needed. We know that 2021 has been a very difficult year, but across Australia, and certainly in my electorate of Bradfield, Australians have responded magnificently. We've got through this period of adversity, and I say thank you to all Australians, particularly those in my electorate of Bradfield. </span>

Most of all we are a country built on community. We have always been able to count on each other in times of conflict and during fires, floods and other natural disasters. Whenever there is hardship, Australians have clung together. Our volunteers in every field—emergency services, charities, CWA, agricultural societies, sports groups and so many more—have always been awe-inspiring. Over the past two years we've seen landlords support their tenants and employers support their workers. But it's a fact that while our communities have shown leadership, our federal government has not. We're all acquainted with the failures of the past two years: the failure to secure vaccines, which caused a late rollout; the ongoing failure to provide purpose-built national quarantine centres, which leaves us exposed to continued breakouts and lockdowns. But the failures are bigger and go much deeper. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a federal government that is rotten to its core and whose disease threatens to infect our national character. It is a government that is destroying our traditions and our institutions and a government that has declared war on the ABC, on universities and on anyone who disagrees with it. We have a federal government that constantly seeks to divide Australians, not bring us together. We have a government that engages in rorts and scandals, a government that lies and tells us it's all just politics as usual, that the end justifies the means. This government tells us that political victory is all that counts, no matter the cost to our national identity and the values we treasure. Leading this government is a prime minister who has proved time and again by his own actions and his own words that he cannot be trusted. His promises mean nothing. They are empty things only said to earn a headline, to be discarded the next day. We have a prime minister who cannot be trusted to tell the truth to the people that he has the privilege to serve. This is not who we are. We are a people who know that our words should be as good as our bond. I reject this Prime Minister's trashing of our reputation and trust. Mateship, unity, honesty, fairness and honour—these are not the values I see in the words and deeds of this Prime Minister. </span>

The choice is easy, Albanese. I wish you all a very merry Christmas and a happy new year.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  A few years ago the federal government contributed $10 million towards a small-animals abattoir at Bourke, in the north-western part of my electorate. It was under round 2 of the federal government's National Stronger Regions Fund, a forerunner of the Building Better Regions Fund. It was $10 million in partnership with the Bourke Shire Council to help them with some of the enabling infrastructure—roads, electricity, water supply—as part of a $61 million project. Sadly, upon completion, the abattoir shortly closed because of the drought and other issues, and it's sat there idle for a number of years. It's been very disappointing for the people of Bourke and the western region of New South Wales. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A bit of good news: recently Thomas Foods purchased the abattoir. They've committed to upgrading and putting more processing facilities in. Hopefully, in early 2022, it will be back in production, killing 6,000 animals a day, either goats or sheep, and providing 120 permanent jobs. When I speak to some of the older folk and the Aboriginal folk who used to work at the Tancred's abattoir, which closed down many years ago, they lament that Bourke was a much more stable and prosperous town when it had that employment on the edge of town. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm incredibly pleased that Thomas Foods have stepped up to take this project on. I know the people of Bourke, Brewarrina and surrounding areas are very excited to have those jobs. It will be a combination of training local people and probably bringing in some skilled workers at the start to get the plant going. However, to be able to have stable work in your own town is incredibly important, and meatworkers are a bit like timber workers or shearers: there's an enormous sense of pride in someone who can say they are a meatworker. My hope is that over the coming years and decades that that culture becomes entrenched in Bourke and the town will grow and prosper from this investment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech"> McBRIDE</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Just like last year 2021 has been incredibly tough on school students in my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales. They faced an extended lockdowns in the middle of the school year because of COVID-19 which interrupted their studies and face-to-face learning. Many of them had to cope with learning from home again, not being able to see their friends, missing out on weekend sport and other activities, and not being able to celebrate milestone occasions like graduations. This has taken its toll but, just like last year, young coasties were up to the challenge. They encouraged each other and pushed through the tough times together. After everything they've been through, it's important to recognise their resilience and achievements. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's Dobell Awards again recognise those students who have gone above and beyond throughout the school year—students like Shari Martin from Holgate Public School. Shari is receiving the Dobell Award this year for her commitment and leadership in school parliament, her positive behaviour and always demonstrating school values. Tamzen Maddrell from Wadalba Community School is being recognised with a Dobell Award for being an outstanding student leader and a great contributor to her school community. Bailey Hodges, also from Wadalba Community School, is receiving the Dobell Award for coaching and officiating community sport. He has also assisted with feeder school carnivals and trials for the past four years with great reviews. Then there's Aari Harris from Blue Haven Public School. She's been recognised with a Dobell Award for her contribution to the school environment and assisting with maintaining the school vegetable gardens throughout the entire year. Ashalina Jessop from Gorokan Public School is a caring and cooperative student who's being recognised with a Dobell Award for her school community service and helping out fellow students and teachers. Sienna Keenan from Wamberal Public School has made significant contributions to the school this year academically, socially and culturally. Siena is being recognised with a Dobell Award for demonstrating strong leadership skills and being an exceptional role model to other students. Sibulele Ives from Tacoma Public School is also being recognised with a Dobell Award for her contributions to the school and the wider community. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ryan Griffey from Tuggerah Lakes Secondary College is receiving a Dobell Award for excellence in iCreate. Amelia Ormsby from MacKillop Catholic College Warnervale is being recognised for her work in the youth ministry and important fundraising initiatives like Mini Vinnies and annual sleep-outs. Evie Rooke from Brooke Avenue Public School is receiving a Dobell Award for demonstrating outstanding effort in lifting the school spirit of her fellow students during this year's lockdown, and Wade Campbell and Xavier Straker from Hopetown School have both been recognised with Dobell awards for being a positive influence in their school community. These are all incredible achievements, and I congratulate you all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now as the school year draws to a close, I'd like to thank all the teachers, principals, parents and carers who have worked so hard to support our students over the past 12 months. You kept them motivated when times were tough, and you made sure they stayed on track with their learning. Our students couldn't do it without your support. On behalf of all coasties, thank you for your efforts, and congratulations again to the recipients of this year's Dobell awards.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  The issue that I wish to raise this afternoon has to do with the supply of timber in Australia, and certainly in Victoria and Western Australia. Court injunctions and industry uncertainty in Victoria—driven by the state Labor government's early move to limit access to timber, a decade ahead of its 2030 ban on native timber harvesting—are already stopping the supply of new logs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now faced with the absurd situation of serious disruptions to not only the building industry but the entire supply chain. It's even going down now to wooden pallets, which are making exports unavailable simply because we cannot use the forklifts to pick up our produce. With this disruption, we are really going to have an incredible, incredible problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the state Labor government in Western Australia has caved to green pressure by banning native logging forests from 2024. But Australia's total imports of products continue to increase. Whilst we have the opportunity to be self-sufficient here in Australia when it comes to timber products, we choose not to be self-sufficient, and we put these ridiculous bans on using our own forests in a sustainable manner. We have possibly the most highly regulated forests for sustainable harvesting and thinning. We put a ban through that, and we then have to go and import to look after the demand of timber into Australia—into Victoria. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a huge demand for housing. Housing demand has risen by about 22 per cent. We've got a huge demand for timber and furniture products. We have the capacity to do it ourselves and become self-sustaining, and in Victoria, with the Labor government, Daniel Andrews's government, we are choosing not to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequence of us not doing that is that we have to import this timber from countries that have heavily unregulated timber-harvesting agendas. What happens now? We used to get most of our wood from New Zealand and Canada. We now get most of our timber products from China. Of course, China don't use their own forests. China go and get their timber products from Russia, from Brazil and from Indonesia, and they sell them on to Australia. We go to Bunnings and we get these timber products, but we have the capacity to provide all of this housing and all of this furniture—to do it all ourselves here in Australia, using the most sustainable practices. We are choosing not to do that. We're choosing to go and rape some other forest in Malaysia, Indonesia or Brazil—</span>

It's a great part of Australia, in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne. It encompasses fantastic suburbs, including Moonee Valley and parts of the City of Maribyrnong, and will also, in the future, encompass Kensington, Gladstone Park, Tullamarine and Melbourne Airport. So, for every member of parliament that visits Melbourne, the first place they visit will be my electorate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes these suburbs great is not their locale but the communities within them. I just want to briefly inform members in the Federation Chamber of the fantastic grants which have been received for local community work and of the meritorious proposals. I want to congratulate the Moonee Valley Toy Library, the Moonee Valley Brass, the Essendon Hockey Club, the Maribyrnong Park sports club, the Avondale Heights Community Garden, the Moonee Ponds Bowling Club, the Trieste Social Club in Essendon, the Strathmore sports club, the Essendon Rowing Club and the Strathmore Bowls Club. I also congratulate St John Ambulance Moonee Valley, who are doing great work; the Hispano American Centre for Family Support; the 1st Milleara scouts; the East Keilor sustainability group; the Northern Obedience Dog Club, where I was an imperfect attendee myself in previous years, training my bulldogs, who are more trainable than I am a trainer—</span>

You would probably do better than me I also congratulate the Strathmore Men's Shed, Farnam Street community education, Maribyrnong Park St Mary's Cricket Club, St Columba's College and Ascot Vale Primary School. All of the groups I've just run through, as well as many other local community organisations, put forward tremendous and economical ideas to improve the contributions of the community and the community capital of my local electorate. From replacing toys at the toy library to music stands, hockey stands, drinking fountains and AV systems—you name it—my local community is made up of very hardworking groups and volunteers. All of the groups I mentioned put forward very meritorious proposals, which we're supporting to have their grants finalised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The wealth of a community isn't just in the value of its property. It's not just the view. It's not just the incomes of its citizens. The wealth and capital of a community is made up of its social networks. During COVID we've found that we need to rely on our local communities more than ever. We've been reminded that what makes a great community isn't just the houses or the streets; it's the people who live within them. I have tremendous respect for the volunteers and committees of these groups and all the groups in my electorate. They make Maribyrnong not the best place in the world, but a place that is not bettered anywhere else. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  This Saturday most residents of New South Wales will be heading to the polling booths for our local government elections. As always, they are hard fought—occasionally civil, occasionally not—and bring a passion to local communities that are typical of local government. I myself had the great privilege of serving for two terms on North Sydney Council. It was a privilege because it was a level of government that involves working, perhaps, closest with residents on issues that affect them extraordinarily directly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I don't want to comment on what will happen on Saturday, but I do want to talk about some of the councillors who have decided not to recontest at the elections. On behalf of my entire community, I want to thank them for their service, because—and many people don't realise this—councillors are effectively volunteers. They get a very tiny stipend for their service. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start with the two mayors in my electorate who are retiring from office. I want to start with the mayor of Willoughby City Council, Gail Giles-Gidney, who has done an exemplary job as the mayor of such an important area of our city. I've worked with Gail during my time as the federal member, and it has been a pleasure doing so. She has brought a real and genuine commitment to Willoughby and to one of the most diverse council areas in our community, and I see that in the practical achievements that the council has been able to deliver under her leadership. I also want to acknowledge the outgoing mayor of Lane Cove Council, Pam Palmer. Pam and I have also worked together on many projects that benefit our local community. I'm thinking particularly of things like the Lane Cove swimming pool, which was at risk of falling into the oval below it. We secured federal funds to support council to rebuild that and for many other projects for the local community. Pam and I have spent the last three months with a regular date on Fridays doing Zoom citizenship ceremonies, and I've seen the warmth and genuine commitment that she brings to those tasks and when working with residents. To Pam: thank you for your service to Lane Cove. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, of course, many councillors that have decided not to recontest. Unfortunately I don't have time to mention all of them, but I will mention a couple I know extremely well: Tony Mustaca; Judith Rutherford, who has provided an incredible service on Willoughby City Council for over 20 years; and Christine Tuon, who was, I think, the first person of Taiwanese heritage on Willoughby City Council. In North Sydney, the deputy mayor, Kathy Brodie, is not standing again. At the other end of the spectrum, I think probably their youngest councillor ever, Sam Gunning, is retiring as well. In Lane Cove, I want to mention Karola Brent, who I know well, particularly through her incredible support for the local arts community. They have been fine representatives. Some have been Liberals; some have not. But I do know that they've been genuinely committed to working for residents and our community, and for that I say thank you. I wish you all the best in your next endeavours—as long as you're not standing for federal parliament!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  Given the past two years, the thought of an upcoming COVID-normal summer is a refreshing prospect. Let's hope that omicron allows that. From bushfires that raged through the country during the black summer of 2020 to the spread of COVID-19, as a nation we have faced extraordinary challenges over the last two years. This year, 2021, was meant to be defined by our recovery from the devastation of 2020. However, with an initial slow vaccine rollout, 2021 has been instead another year which, for the most part, was played out as we sat behind virtual screens. As I reflect on the past year through all the challenges, I have witnessed extraordinary acts from individuals and businesses in our community. It is a remarkable collective achievement that we now have more than 90 per cent of the state of Victoria fully vaccinated. This would not have been possible without our healthcare workers, particularly at Barwon Health, so, to them, I say thank you. Because of everyone's efforts, we can truly get back on to the task of building back from COVID, as we look to 2022. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really thought that in my lifetime the most significant event I would live through would be the September 11 attacks that we commemorated a couple of months ago—the 20th anniversary. I feel now that the pandemic really has eclipsed this. It has completely reshaped the way we live our lives. It has also provided us with the single biggest moment to reimagine our country since the Second World War. The question is whether we will take this opportunity and put our country on a path to greater prosperity. We need to start by reimagining our localities and somebody who did this in Geelong with vision was Frank Costa. Our town will dearly miss Frank and his passion for Geelong. This year we lost Geelong's leading citizen. His stature was built on the strength of his values. He gathered good people around the table and drove solutions to better our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With collective passion and drive to bring Geelong back to life after the pandemic, we can take lessons from Frank's values of leaving no-one behind and look to our next wave of opportunities. One example of those is Care Essentials, a manufacturer of medical supplies in North Geelong. This year they received an Austrade Australian export award. Prior to the pandemic, Care Essentials manufactured patient-warming blankets. When the demand for PPE grew, they commenced making face masks. Their quick pivot and capability was innovative and created new jobs for our region. We can do more of this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The prospect of 2022 in the context of the past two years is really exciting. I think everyone in Victoria feels that. So with optimism for the future, I would like to take this opportunity to wish everyone in Geelong a safe and happy festive season. </span>

In June, Travis won Rotax MAX Queensland championship and recently placed second in the New South Wales championship. This year, he was chosen for the Casino RSM school sporting scholarship. In December, Travis will be travelling to Bahrain to compete at the 2021 Rotax world finals. He will be competing against other entrants from all over the world and is the only entrant to represent Australia in his class. His grandfather Warren will be travelling with him for the 10-day event while mum Casey and dad Trent will be at home cheering him on. Travis, we wish you all the best of luck.</span>

They bought the business in 1997 and it's a family affair. Their daughter Jo worked with Lino in the tyre shop, and as a true family business, Lino and Shirley's second daughter Debbie also joined the staff in 2006. Lino and Shirley have also been heavily involved in the community at the Italo club holding many board positions, running events and in the kitchen cooking pastas. Lino and Shirley recently sold Pirlo's tyres to another local family, Tony and Kelly Millard and their children Sophie, Matt and Brad will also be involved in the business. Lino and Shirley are also looking forward to spending more time with their family, Kylie, Jo, Peter, Debbie, Andrew, Fiona and Todd, and grandkids Hunter, Sienna, Tom, Gina, Amy, Tate and Ruby. Congratulations Lino and Shirley for the service you've done for our community, and I hope it's a retirement well earnt and well spent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IPZ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to reflect on the Minister for Veterans' Affairs annual statement and say to any veterans or Australian Defence Force personnel listening to our broadcast, thank you for your service, and thank you also to the families and the friends who've supported you in that service to our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the previous minister who was directly responsible for most of the reforms spoken about in the ministerial statement, I want to direct my comments today to the ongoing process of reform, and the optimistic and positive quest for change which defined my team's time in that role. At the outset, I want to make one simple point which is often lost in the public debate about military service and our veteran community. We have a well-led, world-class, highly respected, well-trained and incredibly capable Australian Defence Force. We should be proud of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our capability edge is our people. Sure, we need to keep investing in the equipment to allow them to undertake their task, but it is their skills and the training they receive which set them apart. Whether it's during conflicts or peacekeeping missions or humanitarian aid and disaster relief, they are well prepared and well equipped to do the job they do on behalf of our nation. They are all volunteers; they choose to serve in uniform. In return, we owe them the best conditions of service we can provide, every effort to ensure their physical and mental wellbeing, and an opportunity to transition successfully to civilian life. Overwhelmingly, that is exactly what happens. They train well, they serve well, they transition well and they should be justifiably proud of their service, and ready to take on new challenges in their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a job with inherent risks of death and injuries, and as the veterans' covenant states: 'For what they have done, this we will do.' As a grateful nation, we are obliged to support our veterans when they need it. That's why I started saying, 'Thank you for your service' three years ago. It's a reminder to us all. I started saying, 'Thank you for your service' at every public event—not to embarrass Australian Defence Force personnel or veterans but to remind those of us who haven't served about the risks that are taken on our behalf. You keep us safe in an ever-changing world. You are the first people we turn to when the job gets too big for local or state agencies. As a civilian, it's been an extraordinary privilege to see you training and deploying, both at home and abroad. Thank you for allowing me to spend time with you and witness the pride, the passion and the teamwork you exhibit every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I have any advice for our Australian Defence Force personnel, it is simply this: start preparing for your transition to civilian life earlier in your careers. No-one stays in the Navy, the Army or the Air Force forever. Finding a new sense of purpose, a new mission, a new role in our society after your military service is critically important for your wellbeing. The risk of injury means your career could end prematurely and it's why the new joint Transition Taskforce is so important to get right. We have let people slip through the cracks. We have had service personnel who weren't properly supported during transition. We know in this place that we have to do better. That was my personal challenge as the former minister: to work in partnership with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, ex-service organisations and the community to do better every day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a small moment of personal indulgence, it was incredibly humbling to be contacted in my last week in the job by people who were publicly making the case for me to stay as minister. In reality, of course, they weren't asking for me to stay. They wanted the stability, and they were largely happy with the direction we were taking as a team and as a government. We changed lives. We saved lives. We had more to do, but that is the nature of politics in our country. I use the term 'we' quite deliberately. You achieve nothing in politics or in this place as an individual. There's an old African proverb, Deputy Speaker Wicks, which I'm sure you're aware of, which says, 'If you want go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together'. In my relationship with DVA and my own office staff, we worked incredibly well together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the feedback I've received from stakeholders in recent months is disappointing. The new ministerial office is not engaged with the ex-service community or the department in a constructive way, and that's to the detriment of our veterans and their families. I urge the new ministerial office to become team players. In my experience, I was extremely well supported by a loyal and capable staff, along with the outstanding leadership team at the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the ex-service community itself, who were all trying to work together to achieve positive changes. Of course, we had many differences from time to time, but I was in no doubt that the ex-service community was working constructively to try and make a difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same can be said for the secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Liz Cosson. Liz brought her own years of military experience to every policy conversation, and she added her own unique passion, empathy and respect for our veterans community and their families. We would not have achieved any of the reforms outlined in the ministerial statement yesterday without Ms Cosson and her executive staff—without her helping my office to shape public policy and without her advocating so strongly, through the ERC process, for budget bids to succeed in order to secure additional resources for every veteran in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same vein, I wouldn't have known what to even ask for if I hadn't sat down and listened to the department, peak bodies like the Ex-Service Organisation Round Table, the Repatriation Commissioner, the Veteran Family Advocate and the Defence Engagement Commissioner, learnt from the experience and judgement of the leaders of a wide range of veterans groups and their families and respected their opinions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we have invested heavily in veterans employment and transition services, while boosting mental health care and developing a network of wellbeing centres. There's so much more to be done in this space. The new minister's office needs to work with MPs, on both sides of the House, and existing service providers and back in the organisations which are already making a difference on the ground. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a separate note, our decision, as a government—with support from the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer—to include a question on veterans in the census will help us inform our future decisions on where our services need to be located. That data gathering is a breakthrough, and sharing that information with the states is vital. As a government, our introduction of the veterans recognition package and the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant, along with the redevelopment of the Australian War Memorial, will help define how we respect and remember our service personnel in the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the new Sufferings of War and Service public art installation will also help families dealing with the grief of having lost loved ones. I thank the people who worked with me so constructively on such a harrowing and emotionally charged issue. It will be an important piece of artwork, and I thank the Chief of Defence Force for agreeing to fund this work and for not forcing the families to fundraise from other sources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've reported several times before in this place that, as a renowned dog lover, the successful introduction of the Psychiatric Assistance Dog Program is one of my proudest achievements in that portfolio. I've met with veterans who have received a dog, and it has been a life-changing experience for them. We now need to broaden our minds in this place and look at other innovative treatments, things like equine therapy and art therapy. There was resistance at first to the dog program, but we overcame that, and I think being more innovative in future in how we deal with PTSD will be important for our veterans community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the royal commission started this week, and it's a chance to unite our Defence and veterans community. It's important that we tell the good stories and the bad stories. It's important that we continue to learn from any mistakes. We must give our veterans and their families the hope and the confidence that support is available to them, that there are pathways to good health and that we are working in partnership in this place to achieve the best possible outcomes for them. It's so important that we don't feed into a vicious media cycle of despondency, desperation and helplessness. As a backbencher, I want to see this coalition government continue to maintain the momentum for reform and to build on all the good work we've done while the royal commission runs its course. I will continue to promote positive stories and messages of hope for our ADF personnel and our veterans, notwithstanding the very real challenges and the difficulties some may face. As a government and a grateful nation, we must support those who need our help, but at the same time we must promote the many achievements of our veteran community. On that note, I take the opportunity to thank the staff at the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I thank the staff and the volunteers of the ex-service organisations. I thank the families and the friends of serving men and women. And I thank all the people in this place who are working in a bipartisan and constructive way to make a difference. We really have come a long way together, but there's more to be done—together.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I want to start in the way that the former veterans affairs minister, the member for Gippsland, finished, and that is by thanking the hardworking staff at the Department of Veterans' Affairs and thanking all those members of our ex-service organisations who give so much love and support to our veterans and their families. Whether you're in a paid role or, particularly, a volunteer, our nation owes you a great deal of gratitude, not only, in the case of veterans, for your service but for your willingness to help others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to have this opportunity to rise and to speak about veterans and their families. One of the principal reasons that I'm in this place—as I'm sure is the case with other members who have served—is to improve the lot of our veterans and their families, to look after our veterans and their families. I listened with great interest to the minister's statement. I don't think it has helped that he is the sixth Minister for Veterans' Affairs over eight long years of this government. Personally I would have preferred it if the member for Gippsland had continued in that role and we had been able to make some more gains. It's not a slight to the current minister; it's just that there is something to be said for continuity—although I think you can improve a number of things, and that's why I'm here and happy to help. We need that consistency, I think, and there are many examples of where those opposite, the government, can do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister told us he is determined to address the high rates of suicide amongst the ADF and the veteran community, and of course that is something that we all want to ensure happens. We know that there are suicide prevention trials underway. In May this year the government announced that the National Suicide Prevention Trial, at 12 national sites, would be funded for another year of operation and transition. There is $1 million for each site over financial year 2021-22. Those opposite, of course, are good at announcing things, but not a dollar has been received. The money has been announced and not received, so it would be good if that was done as soon as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a truism to say that we can't rewrite history. It is a truism to say that those opposite, the current federal government, fought against the establishment of a royal commission into Defence and suicide for a long time. It took the veterans community and federal Labor, working with those of like mind who knew how desperate the situation was, and it was well past time for the fullest, broadest and highest level of inquiry in order to stop this scourge. It is a shame that it took so long. I know there has been a lot of trepidation among the veterans community about it. But one thing I'm hearing overwhelmingly now from those who were sceptical is, 'I now understand,' because veterans, their families and their advocates have got a chance to tell their story. That is very, very important. Through the telling of those stories, the themes about where our patriotic Australian men and women have fallen through the gaps will become evident and we'll be able to fix the system in a systemic way, which obviously is what we are after. I am concerned that there is a lack of trust in the government, but, given that they fought so hard against this royal commission, if they do not cover it up and if they have an opportunity in government—obviously I hope that Labor forms the next federal government and implements the recommendations, but if it is those opposite, then they need to respect the recommendations and crack on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to supporting specific mental health needs for those participating in the royal commission, I can give you suggestions. These are coming from veterans who are there and present. They're saying it's bringing up difficult issues, as we always knew it would, and there are mental health supports there during the day, but a phone number for after-hours help probably doesn't cut it. If there are mental health professionals made available where the hearings are taking place that can be accessed for face-to-face consultation, then that would be good. That is the feedback from the veterans who are there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of those who are attending the royal commission hearings in Brisbane at the moment, I want to give some feedback direct to the House from evidence given from some of those who are there. I will read an excerpt of evidence given by former serviceman Major Michael Stone, who I served with in Timor-Leste and who is now doing great things for veterans with his not-for-profit organisation. He's based out of Queensland. Before COVID, he was taking veterans into Timor; now he's doing it on a lovely beach up in Queensland. Thank you for your service, Mick, and for your great words to the royal commission. In a totally apolitical and bipartisan way I want to House to learn from them. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Who will have a veteran trust to encourage them, motivate them, understand them, love them, and to call them out? To empower them to take responsibility, accountability and to do the hard work it takes to get healthy and stay healthy?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We—</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">as in his organisation—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">have evidence and methodology that veterans, especially veterans with lived experience, and their partners with lived experience, can do this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Military operations have multiple dimensions of exposure to violence, human suffering and government policy. It should be no surprise that the moral burden of overseas missions and wars, executed on behalf of the Australian people, and ordered by the Australian Government, are left with the Australian veterans to process and their families to absorb the impacts. It's hard to acknowledge, to talk about …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later, he goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The veteran is the embodiment of the best of us as a nation. Those that join the Defence Forces are vetted prior to joining for their mental acuity, physiological stability, health, motivation and physical fitness. On joining, they are above average in every statistic. On departure, they are above average in the worst statistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Like all people, we veterans have our problems, but we can be empowered to be part of the solution. We can significantly contribute to prevention, early intervention and postvention. A paradigm shift for everyone involved from a focus of sickness to a focus on promoting wellness will significantly reduce suicide in the Defence and veteran community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just wanted to share that with the honourable members and with the House, because that is just one example on one day of one hearing where you're hearing, straight from veterans, that they want to actively be part of the solutions, and they have been doing the hard work to make sure they have also evaluated the effectiveness of what they're doing to help their fellow brothers and sisters. o I just want to associate myself, as a veteran, with what Mick said there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many examples I could give of veterans, fine Australians, who have been injured either on operations or during training, and I will give the House some more examples soon in another speech. But, suffice to say, for the finest of Australians serving our country proudly, the least we can do is make sure that they've got every support—every support. The great hope of all honourable members, I'm sure, is that, whilst this royal commission goes on, we support people as best we can, and then, when we get those recommendations, we do the best that we can to implement them, in the interests of our fellow Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently on the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span> program, Afghanistan veteran Daniel Keighran VC, who was given that honour after his efforts in the battle of Derapet on 24 August 2010, had this to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I was there for the men and women to the left and to the right of me on the ground. It's as simple as that. I went, they went. We served our country, the government of the day. I have no questions at all of why we went, or no issues for why we went across there. At the start of the program, you know, I said that I fought beside the Afghan National Army as well. For me, it was absolutely about human rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You know, those friends that I have, or had whilst I was in country, the Afghan National Army. You know, for me, it was about creating a better tomorrow for them. So, yes, there was a number of issues throughout. That's without a doubt. I'm, for one, who's been in combat and situations like that, that every step that you could take could be your last. I'm not going to sit here and question some of the decisions that were made, but let's be honest, mistakes were made.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, Daniel is right. I have the utmost respect for him. I have the utmost respect for all of those who served in that conflict, the longest conflict that Australian services have been engaged in. We lost 41 of our best and bravest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to the former veterans affairs minister, the member for Gippsland, who we heard from earlier. I pay tribute to him because he listened, he cared, he had empathy, and I know that the service he gave veterans between 2018 and 2021 made a lot of difference for those veterans. I also pay tribute to his staff, as well as to Liz Cosson AM, CSC, the secretary of the department and a Major-General, no less. She was the first female Major-General in the Army when she was given that great honour in 2017. I know that her and her department, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, go out of their way—as they should—to do everything that they can for our veterans. No-one always gets it right and there are those who, sadly and unfortunately, slip through the cracks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many veterans in Australia are not in contact with DVA. As at June 2019 there were more than 290,000 Department of Veterans' Affairs beneficiaries in receipt of pensions, allowances and treatments or pharmaceuticals. This number includes about 184,000 veterans and 110,000 dependants. But many veterans in Australia are not in contact with DVA. In 2017 DVA estimated they had contact with one in three veterans who had served since Vietnam and one in five who had served since 1999. DVA estimated there were about 631,800 living Australian veterans who have ever served in the ADF either full time or in the Reserves, as at 30 June 2019. To that end, I was very pleased that a question about military service was included in the recent census. I thought that was very important and timely. Hopefully, that will enable some of those veterans who have not had contact with DVA—for whatever reason; whether it's their own choosing or perhaps something that went wrong with an initial DVA contact—to get the support and the assistance that they need, if they so desire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to hail from Wagga Wagga. It's the only inland regional city with all three military services represented: Army, Air Force and—even though we are many hundreds of kilometres from the nearest drop of seawater—Navy. I'm very proud of that fact. If you serve in the Air Force for any given length of time, you end up at Forest Hill. The 'home of the soldier' at Kapooka is the proud training base for all recruits, who do their initial 12-week training before they are sent to the far-flung corners of the nation—indeed, who knows what corner of the globe—to serve in the khaki, a tradition that stretches back to Gallipoli and even before that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs and a former Minister for Defence Personnel. I am also a former Assistant Minister for Defence. I'm proud of those portfolios and of the work I was able to do in my limited time in those areas—work that was continued, enhanced and improved upon by the member for Gippsland. I listened carefully to the member for Solomon and to the former veterans' affairs minister when they talked about the current Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, which is sitting in Brisbane. It will be elsewhere in the nation too. I'm very pleased to say that it is coming to Wagga Wagga. I know that it is going to Townsville. It is important that it has the regional outreach, particularly in towns and centres where there is a high military presence—and an ex-military presence, because many military people actually retire to the places with which they are familiar. Whilst they are serving they form great friendships, they form great networks and they feel comfortable in those places. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government established the royal commission on 8 July 2021. I know there will be some very sad stories coming out of that. I know there will be some evidence given and some personal tales told that will shock the nation. I would urge and encourage people who want to contribute to that process to do just that, either in person or via other means. But tell your story, tell us about your issues and your concerns, because we need change. We need reform, and this is one way that we will achieve just that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some $11.7 billion in federal funding supports more than 325,000 veterans and their families each year across the board, and the 2021-22 federal budget included an additional $702.6 million with a focus on wellness support, suicide prevention and ensuring the DVA is appropriately resourced, as it should be. Mistakes will be made, and that is why I urge and encourage those veterans to reach out to the department, even if they've had an experience that was perhaps not of their liking or as they wished in previous times. Please reach out, please ask for support if you need it, and if you have a contribution to make to the royal commission then please try to do just that, because we do need to change and it will only be from your evidence and those submissions that we can make the necessary changes. Finally, thank you for your service, to all veterans and all currently serving personnel. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  First and foremost I would like to acknowledge and thank all our past and present ADF members. Thank you for your service. We wouldn't have the freedoms that we have today but for you. I'd also like to extend my thanks to their families, because you make great sacrifice in allowing your family members to serve in the ADF and continuing to support them once they have left the ADF. I'd also like to acknowledge and thank the former defence personnel and veterans' affairs minister, the member for Gippsland. I know the member for Gippsland very well and have seen him and the work that he has done over the few years that I have been here. One thing I can say is that he has empathy for ADF members, and he did as much as he possibly could in his role. I saw that when he came to my electorate on two occasions and met with the local veterans organisations. We have many veterans organisations in my electorate. We have one of the highest cohorts of veterans in Cowper, and the member for Gippsland's empathy shone through. If an issue was raised he and his staff—thank you also to his staff—would address that problem immediately. I would like to thank the former minister for how he undertook his role and the work that he did. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that he said quite often was that not all ADF veterans are broken, but when they are and when they are struggling we as a grateful nation have an obligation to those who served us to support the wellbeing of these men and women over their lifetime. We also have an obligation to continue to encourage them and to ensure that they not only speak up but are heard, that we actually listen. We need to do this consistently, and I think that has been the problem in the past. We have to provide a level of support and advocacy that extends not just to them but also, importantly, to their families. In that regard, I am pleased to say that the federal government has invested $11.7 billion in funding for the 336,000 ex-service personnel and their family members. One of the most important parts of this is something that I'm working on with the veteran community in my electorate as more than $40 million of that funding is to establish veteran wellbeing centres across Australia. There are currently six of them, $5 million per centre. Previously, the services were spread out everywhere, but now those new centres are better targeted to the needs of the veterans and their families in local communities. These services include health and wellbeing, employment, training, housing et cetera, entrepreneurial pathways and volunteering opportunities under the one roof. That is the secret: under the one roof, so the veterans know to go. They might not know what to do, but they know where to go. That's the start, the most important thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former minister, the member for Gippsland, referred to veteran support dogs. I met with a veteran the other day and, seriously, he was like a kid waiting for Christmas because it was only a matter of days until his puppy was turning up. He was so excited, and it was self-fulfilling: he knew that this puppy was going to make him happy and help him get through the day. It might be a very small initiative, but it's something that can make such a huge difference to the life of one person. I made him promise that he would bring the puppy in when he got it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, in my electorate, I've been working closely with veterans organisations to have our own hub and spoke. We're after $5 million–that's not for one; that's for four hub and spokes. It will make the world of difference to the many veterans in my electorate. In that regard, I would like to thank Richard Kelloway, Stephen Sawtell and Pat Magann, veteran advocates, but also, others involved: Justin Poppleton, Louise Freebairn, Peter Bruce, Shawn Bergquist and Bill Wagner for the work that they are doing to help our veterans—it's such important work. They get paid a pittance and do the work of a thousand men—they really do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just address the royal commission very quickly. I could not think of a better appointment than Nick Kaldas as commissioner to the royal commission. I know Nick Kaldas well. He had 35 years in the New South Wales Police Force and retired as assistant commissioner. He is a man of real life hands-on experience. It might not be at war, but it is experience that veterans would understand and appreciate: this is a common man, a decent man and a man who can empathise with them because of that experience. I mean no disrespect to those who graduate university, go straight into a chamber, become senior counsel, do well and are appointed as commissioners—he hasn't come through that way; he's come through with hands-on, hard, real-life experience. He was in the homicide squad, a lead detective for Samantha Knight and many other high-profile cases like Sef Gonzales and John Newman. He has experience of talking to families, empathising with families, which is exactly what he is doing now through this royal commission. He was a negotiator for 10 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already seen, through social media and through reports from people who have listened to him in the short time the commission has been going, that veterans can see this is a man who will make a difference. I have no doubt that he will make a real difference to the lives of those who will give very difficult evidence and tell very hard stories. I cannot imagine for a moment—my heart goes out to those mums and dads—having two teenage children now, that my children would go off to war and come back only to lose their lives because of what they saw. It is unimaginable. I know that the commissioner will listen to you. You will be heard, and changes will be made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I acknowledge the work that needs to be done for our ex-service men and women. There is a vast chasm between what is happening now and what needs to be done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are taking a bipartisan approach. We all want this. We all want this to be resolved and to have a better process for our ADF personnel when they do return home. It is always very difficult, whether you spend five, 10, 15 or 20 years in any service, whether it is the ADF, police, ambos, firies—in a way, you become institutionalised and it does become very difficult. But those who become institutionalised need to have that support when they leave those services. So, to echo the sentiments of our Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel: they have given us their best and, in return, it is only right that we give them our best. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="282986" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  I rise today in recognition that better health for all Australians is key in our development and success as a country. I would like to thank all the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport for their report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">The new frontier</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">delivering better health for all Australians</span>. I extend a special thanks to the member for North Sydney for his work in chairing this inquiry and to the deputy chair—Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Macarthur—who, as a paediatrician, along with me, is a former brother-in-arms on the front line of health care. Alongside the secretariat supporting the committee, the member for North Sydney and the member for Macarthur have overseen the development of 31 recommendations to ensure the best opportunity for health for everyone in Australia. I am delighted that I was asked to be a supplementary member of the committee. It has been a very bipartisan committee. It has been a great experience for me. It is truly something to be recognised in this parliament as something that is actually progressing outcomes for all Australians. So thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your participation, and thank you for allowing me to participate as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know—indeed, most Australians know—that Australia enjoys one of the best health systems of any country. Medicare sits at the foundation of our health system and, combined with private health insurance and private health networks, forms a strong foundational framework of health care that delivers for the benefit of all Australians as part of a universal healthcare system. Indeed, all levels of government are involved in the running of our system, and it is clear that it is a successful system. In fact, as an outcome, Australia ranks eighth in the world for life expectancy. By and large, metrics of health rank Australia in the top 10 worldwide; in fact, some metrics have us at number two. But, of course, there is always more that we can do. We can never be satisfied; we must always strive for better. It is the least we can do for all Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I am very delighted with this report, which has made numerous recommendations towards ensuring that the system works better for all Australians. Each of these 31 recommendations were considered and developed in light of current challenges in the health sector, with tangible benefits for all coming from the adoption of these recommendations. Some recommendations I would like to highlight include the following. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is recommendation 1: the committee calls for the establishment of a centre for precision medicine and rare diseases. As you know, I was a professor at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, which began life as the Murdoch Birth Defects Institute. It is a pre-eminent medical research institute that specialises in both genetics and stem cell research. So it is with great pleasure that I talk about this recommendation, which, if implemented by the minister, will increase the ability of the Department of Health to provide Australians with access to breakthrough drugs and novel medical technologies, particularly for children with rare diseases, because, as you and I know as paediatricians, there is often very little hope for these children. We are currently in the House debating 'Maeve's law', a very important law reform which may offer new hope to people who have this very rare genetic condition through the mitochondria, so it is great to see there would potentially be a centre to focus on new technologies, precision medicine and rare diseases. On top of this, the proposed centre would provide a comprehensive horizon-scanning unit for the aforementioned drugs and technology to support patients. This centre would be well placed to advise the Department of Health as well as the Medical Research Advisory Board. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 3 is another recommendation that I'm particularly proud of—that is, the creation of an office of clinical evaluation within the Department of Health. This office would evaluate both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions as well as establish a 'living evidence' function to ensure that health assessments are informed by the most up-to-date and accurate data. We all know, having been through COVID, how important knowing what the most recent tests, diagnostic as well as therapeutic, are for the care of patients. The opportunity for research to be in a 'living evidence' function would be useful to Australia, as would having external horizon scanning so that we can connect with countries overseas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an aside, Deputy Speaker Freelander, you and I know that medical types in Australia keep up with what's happening internationally through international medical conferences. Australians are great travellers, but health professionals in Australia, particularly doctors and medical researchers, are fantastic travellers, and they have served us well as a sort of subterranean global health diplomacy in this country. You and I both know, being members of the National COVID-19 Health and Research Advisory Committee, that there is a lot of data gathering across jurisdictions by the health professionals in this country that feeds into this NHMRC supported committee and provides evidence for the government and for policy within this country. But it would be great to have an office of clinical evaluation that does this on a continual basis, not just during periods when we're facing health pandemic, such as we are now. By gathering this information and then sharing it with state and territory governments, the proposed office would ensure continuity of the best quality and most effective treatments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my role as co-chair of the newly formed Parliamentary Friends of Medical Technology, I'm particularly pleased by a number of recommendations pertaining to the emergence of new medical technology that will help ensure Australian patients get fast and efficient access to the best available devices and digital products as and when they emerge. Many people watching this will absolutely understand that one medtech that has been of great benefit to all Australians is telehealth, a form of digital interaction with clinicians, which means you don't need to travel to congested inner cities or travel long distances in rural and remote parts of Australia; you can get access to scripts or to review appointments at the drop of a phone call or a videoconference. We want to make sure we can bring these new technologies, which Australia has been at the forefront of developing, to market more quickly and through the regulatory process more efficiently. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To this effect, the committee's recommendation 19 suggests reforms to one part of the medtech sector, the Prostheses List, by firstly addressing the lack of coverage for non-implantable devices under the current arrangements and, secondly, ensuring that there is improved coordination between the Medical Services Advisory Committee and the Prostheses List Advisory Committee to provide faster access for patients. Further, the <span style="font-style:italic;">New</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Frontier</span> report recommended that the independent health technology assessment review reassess relevant aspects of the health technology assessment process to ensure there are future pathways for treatments and therapies that do not fit neatly into the current system, such as for rare cancers, antimicrobials, orphan drugs and precision medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a paediatrician, I would emphasise that it's imperative that appropriate clear pathways are considered for inclusion for paediatric medicines and technologies. The committee was of the clear view that precision medicine approval pathways will require a different application assessment process than current approaches designed for treatments for common conditions, with their large datasets and comparative evaluations. Finally with regard to medtech, the committee recommends that the Department of Health introduce an equivalent to the managed access programs for medical devices. The report recommended that the details of this scheme, including the eligibility criteria and duration, should be formulated in consultation with patient groups, clinicians and industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that recommendation 21 is of particular interest to you, Deputy Speaker, as it is to me. The committee calls for the standardisation of newborn screening across Australia—and about time too, I would say. On top of this, the committee recommended an expansion of the newborn screening program in light of the increased understanding of genomic testing. We know, again from the Murdoch Children's Research Institute but also the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, that genomic research is pre-eminent here in Australia, and we should take advantage of that not just for our patients and for Australians but also for the business opportunities that this provides to Australian businesses. Preventative health care is immensely important to me, considering my background in paediatrics, and accurately screening our youngest Australians is crucial to make sure that we can detect those early conditions as early as possible, to give them the best possible chance for a good start to life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's recommendation for increased patient voice is something I see as paramount for moving forward. The committee implores the Department of Health to bring patient voice upfront into the health technology assessment system. This includes representation of peak patient bodies in the system, refreshing every three to five years. Particularly importantly, we did as a committee recognise that there was a dearth of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as voices with regard to, particularly, medicines that may have specialty in their situation. I'm very pleased that we have identified this as a gap in our healthcare system. We know that they experience everything, and we need to make sure that patient voice is pivotal to improving our healthcare services in general.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's health system is oft lauded as one of the best in the world, but complacency and satisfaction will not improve the lives of Australians in the health system. We must continue to deliver better health for all Australians. This indeed is a time for the new frontier, and COVID has focused that more now than ever. Looking at this part of health technology delivery in Australia will help give every Australian the opportunity for better health. I commend this report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker Freelander, I'd like to start by acknowledging the member for North Sydney as the chair of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport and you as the deputy chair of the committee for your work throughout this inquiry into the approval processes for new drugs and novel medical technologies in Australia. In fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have been invited to join the committee as a supplementary member, so, personally, I thank you. To the committee members, including the member for Makin and the member for Moncrieff, thank you for making me and the member for Higgins welcome as supplementary members for the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As others have said, there is no doubt Australia has one of the best healthcare systems in the world, underpinned by Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and designed to provide quality, safe and affordable health care to all Australians. But we have much more to do. As COVID-19 has shown, the further you live outside of a big city, the more vulnerable you are and the worse your quality of life is likely to be, especially if you're living with chronic disease. Acute shortages of healthcare workers and higher out-of-pocket costs are leading to longer waiting times and poorer health outcomes for the seven million Australians living in regional and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have today to speak on the report, I am going to focus on the areas of affordability and access, particularly around medicines, as a pharmacist of over 20 years. I know that community pharmacies play a vital role in our healthcare system. There are almost 6,000 community pharmacies across Australia, and in communities outside big cities pharmacies are often the only place where locals can seek health care, where they can walk in without an appointment and get quality up-to-date information and advice. In fact, in some 70 towns in Australia that are without GPs or other allied health support, pharmacists and pharmacies are the only health care available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, pharmacists are some of the most trusted healthcare professionals in the world, but they are facing serious challenges when it comes to caring for and supporting their communities and their patients. We often talk about patient centred care. I think there is a big gap between the rhetoric and the reality, particularly for the most vulnerable people, and especially those living outside of big cities. The last two years have been particularly tough, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing global supply chain disruptions and local outages in many communities. I remember a parent talking to me about not being able to get infant Panadol for their child and being very concerned about what they might be able to do to make sure that their child was safe and well. I've had people talk to me about not being able to access Ventolin inhalers and asking, 'If I see my GP and I get a prescription, am I more likely to be able to get a Ventolin inhaler than if I go in and ask over the counter?' These are essential medicines, vital for Australians, and what COVID-19 exposed was, in a well-designed healthcare system, the vulnerabilities, particularly in global supply chains, leading to local outages. This has made it harder for Australians, as I've mentioned, particularly for those seven million Australians living outside of big cities, in regional and remote communities across Australia, to access life-saving medicines that they both need and deserve. This is being seen in hospital settings. There were already problems before COVID-19, but those vulnerabilities have been further exposed. There have been outages in common, routine, day-to-day medicines that have put patients at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key recommendation of this report has been around the supply of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We must, all of us, make sure that medicines, particularly new medicines, are always universally affordable for all Australians wherever they live and whatever they earn. It is so important, and I want to reference some of the remarks the Pharmacy Guild of Australia made as part of the inquiry that led to this report. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia made a submission where they spoke about the cost of new medicines, particularly to the community. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">New medicines are likely to be highly specialised and have the potential to be significantly more expensive than anything currently available on the market. For small businesses like community pharmacies, this presents a serious cash flow problem and business risk</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really important that we make sure that community pharmacies, the almost 6,000 community pharmacies across Australia, are able to provide medicines affordably to their communities, and especially to the most vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's latest report, just over one in 20 Australian adults, or 6.6 per cent of the population, delayed or avoided filling a prescription because of the cost. I've heard from community pharmacists who have had patients come into their pharmacy with a bundle of prescriptions and a trolley of groceries, almost apologetic that they have buy the essential groceries that they need before they can decide which prescription to get filled. I've had parents say to me, 'Can I get one of the antibiotics filled and share it between the two children?' Or, 'Can I take this medicine every second day to stretch that one-month prescription to last two months?' This shouldn't happen in a wealthy country like Australia. Australians shouldn't be forced into a position where they are having to decide which medicines they can skip or which script they can avoid or delay filling. That shouldn't happen in Australia because that is a risk to the individual. It's also a risk to our healthcare system and to our economy. It's bad for patients and it's bad for the economy. In the Hunter, New England and Central Coast region of New South Wales, which is the community that I represent, the number of people avoiding or delaying filling scripts is higher, as it is outside big cities—6.8 per cent. The high cost of medicine is, as I mentioned, forcing people to delay or avoid seeking treatment and care. It is bad for their health, it is bad for our healthcare system and it is bad for the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pharmacists are also calling for adequate training prior to any new medicine or novel medical technology coming onto the market so that they can provide the most up-to-date and effective advice to their patients. This is vital. As I said before, pharmacists are some of the most trusted and relied upon healthcare professionals in our communities, and they're well-placed to support patients who need highly specialised medicines, and new and evolving therapies. But they need to be properly supported, with timely access to the most up-to-date and evidence-based information to protect the health and best interests of their patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a need to address renumeration. I have spoken about this before. Pharmacists were asked early to put in expressions of interest to be part of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Because of the way that the vaccines were rolled out, many pharmacists and pharmacies weren't able to participate in the vaccine rollout until June. That was the earliest that pharmacists were able to participate. Now we're seeing that Pfizer has been recognised as a universal booster. Pharmacists are being paid $16 per jab. There are 27 different requirements they have to comply with in order to be able to provide a jab. I have heard that some pharmacists reluctantly feel they will not be able to continue to participate in the vaccine rollout. As state and territory governments stand down mass vaccination centres and vaccine hubs and they're relying more and more on the network of GPs and pharmacies across Australia, I don't know how they can justify the poor remuneration for pharmacies. It's a big concern to me. The current arrangements don't reflect the costs associated with ordering, handling and dispensing these vaccines. This needs to be properly addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have left, I would like to put my full support behind pharmacists and other allied healthcare workers being properly supported in the work that they do. It's essential that all healthcare professionals are able to work to the full scope of their practice, to make sure that all Australians can get proper health care—especially those Australians living outside of major cities. As the Pharmacy Guild have said in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Pharmacies often are presented with very little incentive to stock or be involved in supplying high cost specialised medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This must change so that all Australians can access the care they need. As the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia said in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a strong track record in the regulation of therapeutic goods underpinned by an evidence-based framework as well as timely and cost-effective considerations around access to and subsidisation of medicines and therapies for patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the beginning, Australia has one of the most highly regarded healthcare systems in the world, underpinned by Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This has been a bipartisan inquiry, but it can't go without mentioning that those two schemes were Labor initiatives. I know the first time I met you, Deputy Speaker Freelander—and this is why you're in this place—you said to me, 'I will not end my medical career as I started it: without Medicare.' I think it is so important to all Australians that we have universal health care: health care for everyone, wherever they are born, wherever they live or grow old. I think that's something that this report has underscored: the need to make sure that all Australians have access to quality, affordable health care. </span>
                </p>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I agree with the member for Dobell that it is important that all Australians have access to affordable health care—and Medicare's not going anywhere. I'm very pleased to be able to stand in the Federation Chamber in this place and speak on this report, called <span style="font-style:italic;">The new frontier—delivering better health for all Australians</span>, which is why many of us are here. We want to be able to see that, ongoing for Australians, there is affordable and accessible health care for those who can't afford it. It's worked very well having half-private, half-public—just like schooling, half-public, half-private works very well; of course, we've heard the great Liberal leader John Howard iterate that many times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, I want to acknowledge the chair, the member for North Sydney and the deputy chair; Deputy Speaker Freelander, member for Macarthur; my colleagues, the member for Higgins, member for Reid, member for Dobell of course, and for Oxley and Makin for their inputs into this very special and important inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report looks at opportunities to deliver better health care for Australians through our regulatory and health technology assessment process for both medicines and technologies. As outlined in the chair's forward and at the heart of this inquiry are the needs of patients, Australians who are born with or acquire conditions, many of which have so far eluded highly effective treatments. That's why this inquiry was undertaken: for the future of those Australians who face those health difficulties. It is very challenging. We all have health challenges in our lifetimes; very few of us actually get through our lives without some kind of health challenge. So it was very important to me personally to be part of this inquiry with my colleagues who did such a good job. It was a bipartisan effort, Deputy Speaker, as you're very aware. Everything in this report is about those Australians with rare medical conditions, especially those Australians who may require novel drug and treatment technologies, and those who indeed sometimes in their darkest hour need hope for moving forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has one of the best health systems in the world, as we've heard members from both sides of this chamber acknowledge. Our success in protecting Australians during a global pandemic is the latest evidence of both the strength of our healthcare system, and the quality and dedication of all of those who work in the health sector. Can I take the opportunity to thank you if you work in the healthcare sector for the work that you've done, particularly over the last 21 or 22 months and moving forward into next year. Let's compare Australia's record, sadly, of, 2,000 deaths during this pandemic. Of course, each one is a tragedy, each one belongs to a family—perhaps a father, an uncle, a son or a daughter. But, when we compare our record to other countries around the world—for example the United States, with 750,000 lives lost—each one, again is tragic and has a ripple effect on all of those family members. Our country has indeed done very well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course innovation is happening at a very fast pace. Governments have a duty to ensure that Australians continue to have access quickly to medicines and medical technology and that our health systems facilitate that outcome rather than hinder it. Australians can also benefit from being at the forefront of innovation through clinical trials and having a strong domestic research development and manufacturing capacity. Some of these comments were made by the chair of this particular committee, the member for North Sydney. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019 more than 95,000 Australians participated in clinical trials, which saw the commencement of approximately 1,880 trials, which employed 8,000 Australians. I speak of this because it is particularly relevant in my electorate of Moncrieff. The Gold Coast clinical trial sector is an emerging, rapidly growing sector with well-established demand drivers, including ageing and diverse and rapid population growth. The Gold Coast is actually the largest regional city in the country for the delivery of clinical trials, experiencing 32 per cent growth and employing approximately 44,000 people. That's significant. It is an emerging sector on the Gold Coast. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One example of emerging technology in Moncrieff is that which is being used by Dr Hal Rice. I've spoken about him before in this chamber, but he deserves me taking a few moments to talk about his achievements in terms of surgery on brain aneurysms. What Dr Rice does is robotically perform surgery on brain aneurysms. He also has a 3D printer, with which he prints out the actual aneurysm that a person has—the stroke or the blood clot in the brain—and his medical students are able to rehearse on that 3D model of the aneurysm. This, indeed, saves lives. Virtually every time I invite Dr Rice to anything, he has to scuttle off to save another life. I thank him for the work that he does out of the ADaPT centre at Griffith University, which is my alma mater.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of the growing clinical trial, medtech and biotech sectors at the health and knowledge precinct at Griffith University in Southport. Recommendation 17 of the report actually recommends:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support that because it will support the growing sector on the Gold Coast.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't talk to all the recommendations, because time does fly in the chamber, but I will talk quickly about recommendation No. 1, which is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Australian Government establish a Centre for Precision Medicine and Rare Diseases within the Department of Health.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This would enable a dedicated centre for rare diseases and a way forward for those who need access to drugs and technology to treat and perhaps cure their conditions. The committee also recommended that the Department of Health's capacity should be enhanced to provide Australians with timely access to new drugs and novel medical technologies, including for rare diseases, and that health technology assessment, HTA, processes and the government's research agenda should align with this outcome. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  Deputy Speaker Freelander, I firstly want to congratulate you as the deputy chair; the member for North Sydney, of course; and all the members we've heard from today who are on the committee. I'll be brief. My contribution today is an acknowledgement of someone who was not on the committee but whom the committee heard from. I want to draw the attention of the House to the story of one of my constituents, who I've spoken about prior to this report in this House, and I want to congratulate the committee on the bipartisan report <span style="font-style:italic;">The new frontier—delivering better health for all Australians</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the middle of this year, I was contacted by the amazing Sue Tantaro. Sue wanted to contact me on behalf of the Save Our Sons campaign to provide a local, anecdotal example—her family's story—of muscular dystrophy. Sue Tantaro has three grandsons, Anthony, Jakob and Lukas, who have duchenne muscular dystrophy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few days prior to the meeting, Sue rang to tell me the deeply sad, tragic news that her beautiful grandson Lucas had unexpectedly passed away. This determined grandmother, with indescribable grief, didn't cancel the meeting, because it was too important for her to have the opportunity to speak to her local MP for the boys in her family and boys like her grandchildren all over the country. She understands that we in this place need to understand their needs and their hopes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She used her grief as inspiration to pursue clinical trials on gene therapy. I promised Sue that I would assist her in any way I could, to help her make life a little easier for Anthony and Jacob and boys like them across the nation. That's why I am speaking today on this report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sue also met the member for Macarthur, who I also want to thank for his dedication generally and his work in this place on a report like this. While this report speaks to a range of ways to modernise how we treat illnesses and disease, I really want to speak on Sue's behalf today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Macarthur pointed out in the tabling of this report, one of the most important things that have come out of the report is the importance of patient centred care; a cooperative and collaborative approach to health care; and, as we heard the member for Higgins reference this afternoon, the prioritising of patient voice in our health space and in our decision-making. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report discusses evolving genetic treatments for fatal disorders such as duchenne muscular dystrophy—the very treatment which Sue is fighting so hard for. I want to echo the member for Macarthur's words about how wonderful this treatment could be as a way forward to curing the illness. The report really does provide a pathway for how we in this place develop our health policies and approach treatments in a modernised way, and I welcome the report's call for a centre for rare diseases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Circumstances, hardship and a desire to act create heroes of ordinary people, and that's what Sue is. She is such a hero. I want to congratulate the committee but also thank people around the nation like Sue, whose voices shape the way we act in this place on such important issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would finish by saying that it is an incredibly strange thing to do to sit with someone like Sue and hear their story. In the moment, with that person, you know that you want to do everything you can to help them. But it's sad that, at the moment, in our health system or when we're making decisions, we're relying on those voices to come to us rather than having a system where that kind of advocacy is not required. However, I don't say any of that to limit the power of the advocacy from Sue and from grandmothers and grandfathers and mums and dads and patients all around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to again congratulate the committee and again reiterate to Sue, through the chair, that she will always be front of mind when it comes to how I approach these issues. I hope she had the same impact on members of the committee.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  I thank the member for Lalor for her contribution to this debate. It very much reminds me of so much of what we heard in the course of the inquiry. I'll come back to that in just a moment. I also begin by acknowledging and thanking both the chair and deputy chair who I believe showed tremendous leadership in steering this inquiry and, ultimately, putting together the recommendations that are now before us. Although they number 31, in reality there are probably over 100 sub recommendations that arose from the inquiry, all of which go to changes that I believe will ultimately make our health system here in Australia not only better but, indeed, one of the best in the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank all of those who assisted and participated in this inquiry—and I am referring to the health department officials, industry sector, researchers, health professionals from both hospitals and universities, and the patient voices. This is where I come back to the comments by the member for Lalor about the patients and families who highlighted to the committee their everyday struggles and frustrations with the health and medical system that they interact with on a daily basis. The committee heard their stories and about the importance of both this inquiry and the urgency of adopting the recommendations. We heard their heartfelt pleas as just recounted by the member for Lalor when she recounted Sue's story about how the system could and should be changed to try and support those families who each and every day struggle with illnesses and diseases, particularly when it concerns younger members in families. I believe that a country like Australia could do more to help than we currently do. I think it was those impassioned pleas that have shaped and guided the committee in coming to the conclusions and recommendations that it did. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medical science is advancing at a rapid pace, and I think that that is well accepted, just as all science seems to be moving quickly. Personalised and precision medicine, underpinned by genomic testing, is changing for better medical treatment in Australia and around the world. But our regulatory system—and I'm referring to organisations such as the TGA, ATAGI, MSAC, PBAC, Medical Benefits Schedule and so on—as well as it has served us for many, many years, also needs to change at the same pace. It needs to keep pace with the rate of change in medical science, because if it doesn't then we start falling behind. That is, in fact, what this inquiry revealed: whereas medical advances are moving at such a rapid pace, it appears that it takes too long for some of the new technology or medicines to become available to the broader community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In looking at those delays, the reality is that each day of delay adds considerably to the suffering and cost and sometimes even the shortening of life for those people who would benefit from new technology that is being worked on. I accept—and I would be the first to say—that we should not rush medicines and medical equipment through so quickly that it creates a risk in any way to patients. However, the reality is that today we are developing new medical technology at a rapid pace and it is developed in a way that can be assessed much more quickly than it has been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of the inquiry we heard time and time again from applicants, the industry sector and medical researchers about those lengthy delays, which sometimes run into years and years. Years of delay, undoubtedly, make a world of difference to the quality of life of the people who will ultimately benefit from those particular medical products coming to market. From all of the different submissions we received, with respect to delays, in the end the product that was being delayed got to market. In the end it was proven to meet all of our standards and proven to be something that should have, and could have, been made available a lot earlier. Had it been made available, those people, who relied on it and who were going to benefit from, would have been able to do so much earlier. As I said, at times we're talking about a person's life, where the delay in having the medicine could have made a difference to whether the person lived or not and certainly would have made a world of difference as to whether the person lived a better life because they could afford to pay for all of the medical services that they required. This is another issue, because one of the things that was made very clear from the inquiry is that we don't seem to properly value new medical technology. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have health economists in this country that are able to give a holistic value of a particular product. Sometimes we simply look at the bottom line, but we don't look at all the other costs that would be saved if that product was made available earlier and at a lower price. Things like that need to be factored in to the medical services of this country. One of the things that particularly concerned me was that we often—in fact, too often—do not support medicines and new technologies that are being researched for rare conditions or where we have a smaller research firm looking at something. If it's a rare condition obviously the market for the product is not going to be large and the required investment sometimes simply doesn't justify the cost of research, not because the product or technology won't work but because the money and effort for the research won't be returned to the researchers even if the product is approved. Given the delays in and the costs of applications, many a time the researchers simply don't give the product the priority it needs. It's the same for small research companies that quite often have a great idea and do some terrific research, but the cost to them of taking their product through the system and to market are prohibitive. Again, in those cases the real losers are the people that would have benefited from having the product available because they're struggling day after day with the health condition that that research would have targeted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we can do better with respect to those smaller research companies and those suffering from rare conditions, and that is one of the things that we ought to be focusing on. Obviously, listening to the patient groups also impacted on the committee's final assessment of what we could and should be doing. Patient groups are not given a strong enough voice in the approvals system that we currently have, and I believe that they need to be. In fact, even the approvals system needs to adapt to the point where, when applications are being assessed, the professionals that are making those assessment are in tune with the latest technology. If that means bringing on specialists in different parts of the approvals process then so be it, because we do have some very good professionals in this country who are experts in their field. We should be drawing on their expertise and their advice when a product relating to their field is being brought to market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that concerns me—and I'm pleased that the recommendations go to this as well—is the very fee structure that we have in place. One of the concerns that was raised by so many is that, if an applicant doesn't get approved in the first round, the reapplication fees can be exorbitant. There were applicants who simply didn't proceed on that basis. We need to have a sliding scale of fees where, once an application has been dealt with, the subsequent applications, given the work that's already gone in to the first assessment, could be a lot lower, as they should be. We should also have a system in place—and the recommendations also go to this—whereby applicants who simply don't have the money are able to repay the money once they start making a profit from the product, perhaps like our university HECS fees system. I'll finish on this: I think the recommendations are comprehensive and I hope that future governments take this report seriously, because a lot of good work went into it. I hope the report doesn't simply sit on shelves collecting dust, because if it does people in Australia will continue to suffer unnecessarily because medical products that could have been brought to market early are simply not being brought to market.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  Failing to act on matters of significance for Australians seems to be a Morrison government speciality. The full impacts of two such failures are now impacting people in my electorate and many others across the nation. Australia is in the midst of a severe timber shortage and, as a result, a housing shortage. Timber suppliers and building industry managers across my region are calling the timber shortage a national crisis that will have significant knock-on impacts for jobs and for the economy. but the Morrison government is doing little to fix it. In essence, the building industry is struggling to get essential timber products such as roof trusses for housing builds. Delivery delays for roof trusses in my electorate are already out to eight months or more. The timber shortage will continue to send timber prices and the cost of housing through the roof. That's placing huge stress on the building industry and on mum-and-dad home builders—the ones who've struggled to scrape the funds together to enter the housing market. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Building companies are financially stretched, and jobs are under threat. The current spate of building company collapses are, in large part, due to material shortages. Shortages mean that jobs don't get done. People can't get paid, so there's a cash flow crisis. Dreams of would-be home owners are being shattered, while others are seeing their homes left unfinished as their building company collapses. This is leaving small subbies and tradies in the lurch and often owed large sums of money when companies go under. My office is hearing tragic stories from people caught in this nightmare of having all their savings tied up in a half-built house that may never be finished. The stress of pending financial ruin, the fear of not having a place for their family to live in, the legal mire to sort through to get answers from liquidators are very real for these people. It's a crisis that has been a long time in the making and one which this government should have foreseen and moved to mitigate or alleviate—and it's not going to end anytime soon, according to one of the nation's leading prefab manufacturers, Timbertruss, based in my region in Geelong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Construction is a huge driver of the local economy in my electorate and in other areas of the nation. The construction industry in the Geelong regional economy accounts for about 9,700 jobs within the City of Greater Geelong, 1,350 in the Surf Coast shire and 500 in the Golden Plains shire. Currently we still import around 35 per cent of our timber from overseas, bringing it long haul from Canada, Finland and other countries like Czechoslovakia. Sourcing timber from overseas is costing between 85 and 125 per cent more, and this is inevitably being passed on to the builder, leading to a concerning increase in the cost of housing. It's not only about cost. It's adding significantly to our carbon footprint, when the timber industry should be contributing significantly to carbon retention—as would happen if we had a sizeable national timber plantation estate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently there are only 2,750 hectares of new plantations of softwood nationally, yet we need 400,000 new hectares of plantations by 2030 just to meet future demand. The Morrison-Joyce government promised to meet a one-billion-plantation-trees target in 2018, but they have failed to deliver, doing next to nothing on this promise. In fact, a concessional loan program set up to help meet the one-billion-trees target is yet to even open. An amount of $500 million was promised before the last election towards this target—once again, hollow words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent joint report by Master Builders Australia and the Australian Forest Products Association says Australia's timber shortage will escalate. By 2035, the nation will be short 250,000 home frames. That's the equivalent of the housing stock in the cities of Greater Geelong and Newcastle combined. The flow-on impacts for apprentices, local carpenters, electricians, roofers and plumbers and the related retail sector are already being felt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am seriously concerned that our nation is in the early stages of what looks likely to be a long-term crisis, with potentially huge economic ramifications. That's why I've recently called for an inquiry and a national task force to be set up to develop a national supply chain and sovereign capability to address Australia's timber supply crisis. The Morrison government has yet again dropped the ball on this issue, which is so crucial for my region's jobs, for the local economy and for this nation's economy. The coalition claim to be good financial managers, but this doesn't seem to add up, to me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to turn to another Morrison government failure, the telecommunications industry. This is a significant issue in my electorate, where, despite being next to Victoria's second-largest city, Geelong, there are abysmal connectivity problems. Pockets of my electorate don't have any connectivity. Good connectivity is essential in the modern world. If we didn't know that prior to the pandemic, we certainly know it now. How can it be that, just a few kilometres from my electorate office, in the suburbs around Geelong, Bellarine and Surf Coast, they have to rely on the oldest version of antiquated ADSL dial-up technology for their data communications? Now their telco is talking about phasing out ADSL in their peri-urban area, and they live in fear they'll be left with no data communication, no option, other than expensive and time limited satellite. There have to be adequate upgrade plans and affordable pathways for regional or remote Australians who are using ADSL, before their services are discontinued. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the NBN, or the lack of it, which is so frustrating for so many. One couple in my electorate, Mary and David, live on a small rural allotment not much more than a stone's throw away from massive urban growth development. They can't get the NBN, and only occasionally, if they're lucky, do they get mobile reception. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in the Geelong suburb of Armstrong Creek in my electorate, one of the fastest-growing urban areas in Australia, connectivity is poor. After getting many complaints about poor or non-existent mobile coverage and frequent dropouts, I held a virtual community meeting to better scope the problem. Often people can only get coverage outside the front door of their house or in one particular room. Sometimes whole streets seem to be dead zones for mobile reception. And, for many people, it is more than simply frustrating; it is a matter of life and death. I know of people with severe medical conditions who would be unable to call for help. Some of them were on my Zoom meeting, and I can tell you it was exceptionally emotional, listening to people in tears. It's a Morrison government failure. The government should have long ago mandated robust requirements for telcos to provide mobile services in new urban communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there were the recent storms across my electorate and more widely across Victoria which exposed the vulnerability and inadequacy of the mobile network during emergencies. Many mobile towers have totally inadequate battery backup or other emergency power options. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the government has rolled out a second-class, slow NBN to the nation, largely based on copper wire to the home. It's Labor that will deliver the full fibre-to-the-home superfast NBN that this government should have delivered in the first place, many years ago. Labor has pledged to invest $2.4 billion across the nation so that 90 per cent of the fixed line services, more than 10 million premises, will have world-class gigabit speeds by 2025, and I can tell you my community is very pleased about that. We need better planning, stronger minimum service guarantees and performance benchmarks and oversights for the telecommunications industry. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="274506" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  The events of the past week have shown us the important role that government can play in people's lives—protecting Australians' health and protecting their security. There have been a number of events where, to my mind, the government has responded rapidly and effectively to external shocks, which in other countries or other situations would have posed a real threat to our way of life. In our near neighbours of the Pacific, the Solomon Islands, unfortunately, we have seen an outbreak of unrest, which is not uncommon in the Solomon Islands. It is often between the two major islands, Guadalcanal and Malaita. This has been triggered again recently. Thankfully, we have been able to respond very quickly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are now 45 Australian Federal Police and 76 members of the ADF who have already arrived in the Solomon Islands to support an existing presence there. I want to thank those who have deployed and their families. They are employed by and large from the member for Herbert's seat, from Townsville. They are a rapid reaction force; they are on a short time frame in terms of notice to move, so they can deal with exactly these sorts of contingencies. When this last happened, in 2003, Australia didn't have the agreements in place to respond, or indeed the capabilities to respond as quickly as we would have liked. We then had to send in a much bigger mission, RAMSI, the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, which had to stay for much longer. Today, we have been able to move much more quickly to stabilise the situation there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen the emergence of a new COVID variant, named omicron after one of the letters in the Greek alphabet. All the indications are—at least in South Africa and Botswana, where it originated—that this variant is much more contagious than other variants. It is quickly beginning to displace the delta and alpha variants in South Africa. It is not yet clear whether this variant is any more lethal or any more dangerous to human health. It is not yet clear, but it is expected that vaccines will continue to remain effective against omicron. But yet again the government has acted very quickly. We have suspended flights from South Africa and eight neighbouring southern African countries. We have put in place quarantine arrangements for any Australians or permanent residents returning from those places. We have also instituted genomic sequencing and testing for the small number of people who have arrived in Australia and tested positive for this variant. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature of these sorts of infectious diseases is that, in an evolutionary sense, they don't have an incentive to kill their host; they have an incentive to replicate quickly and keep their hosts alive. It may well be that omicron, while a more contagious variant, may well be a less lethal variant, which is what has happened over time with things like the common cold and the flu. The severity has lessened and the ubiquity has grown. We don't yet know what the case is with omicron but it is important that we act conservatively and take precautions, as we are doing here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week in parliament we have also been debating—and the committee I chair, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has also been debating—the first implementing arrangement under the AUKUS agreement. Members will be aware that this is an arrangement between Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom that will allow us to acquire nuclear powered submarines in addition to cooperating in other areas. I cannot overstate the importance of this capability in the country that faces the strategic circumstances that Australia faces. Nuclear powered submarines will be a game-changer for our capability. They can operate with greater range, greater endurance, less ability to be detected, higher lethality and higher speeds. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To demonstrate the closeness of this relationship, this is only the second time in United States history that it has been willing to share nuclear propulsion technology with another country. The first time was with the United Kingdom in the 1950s. This is the second time—with Australia. This week, my committee, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, has been reviewing the implementing arrangement which allows for the exchange or sharing of naval nuclear propulsion information—classified and unclassified—to allow us to conduct the feasibility studies we need to do to determine the optimal pathway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at our performance through the pandemic—which, again, is a key purpose of government, and we have been reminded of that with this new variant outbreak—I think you have to say that, whilst challenges remain, we are in a very good position in Australia. In relation to our vaccination rate, we have over 86 per cent of the over-16 population fully vaccinated. Over 92 per cent have now had their first dose. In my own state of New South Wales, which has moved more quickly with the vaccination program, partly because of the outbreak and the lockdown earlier this year, 92.4 per cent of the over-16 population is fully vaccinated, and 94.5 per cent have now had their first dose. This means we will end up with one of the highest vaccination rates of any developed or advanced country—or indeed any country—in the world in a very short space of time. That will provide a level of protection to our public against new variants. There are also boosters available: people are now receiving their booster shots and there are many more vaccines in the pipeline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at our economy, ours is one of the few economies that is larger now than it was going into the pandemic. We've got 900,000 more jobs than we had in May last year. We've got more people in employment and we've got an economy that's larger. In fact, some of the biggest economic challenges that we're facing are ones on the supply side rather than the demand side. We've got a scarcity of labour. We've got many industries that are crying out for workers because our borders have been shut, but there's no shortage of consumer demand. We've seen that in both the consumer confidence figures and the business confidence figures. Again, our economy in Australia is the envy of much of the Western world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at how we've travelled in disease terms through this pandemic: in the United States, over 12 per cent of people—that's about one in eight—have had COVID. In the United Kingdom, it's about 11 per cent or around one in nine. Many of those have recovered; many, sadly, have not. But many of those will suffer from the effects, which are still not very well understood, of what's called long COVID, enduring symptoms like fatigue, compromised cardiac function, inability to concentrate and general lethargy. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia the figure is 0.4 per cent of people who have had COVID, so that's one in 250 people. It's a fraction of what we've seen in other countries, and that's a testament to the public health measures we've been able to put in place to protect people from COVID. If we had something like the comparable death rates that we've seen in OECD countries, we would've experienced about 30,000 deaths from COVID here in Australia. Instead, we're at around 2,000 deaths, all of those indeed are tragedies, but compared to where we are with the rest of the world, I think we are in a very good place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I'll mention our digital media reforms which were announced this week. These are new laws which we propose to introduce soon to combat trolling on online media. I think anyone who's been on digital media—and, unfortunately, our jobs often require us to do just that—who's engaged in these worlds or anyone who's a parent who's got children who are on digital platforms and use it to connect cannot but be appalled at the level of bullying, abuse and viciousness that accompanies some of that activity. I think we all know, intuitively, a large part of it is because people hide behind the cloak of anonymity: people feel liberated to say things they would never dare to say to someone to their face or they wouldn't think to say if they were encountering someone in the street or a restaurant. Instead, on social media, they often feel they have a licence to do so because their identity can be masked. What our legislation will do is compel digital media platforms to unmask the identity of these people and so discourage them from engaging in this sort of behaviour. If the digital media platforms refuse to do so, they themselves will be held liable for the content, when and where it's defamatory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm reminded of a proverb I used to hear when I travelled to Africa in my previous role, when I was a government official with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Anytime you go to a think tank meeting in Africa, meet with government ministries or attend a strategic dialogue, they'd always wheel out a saying—I think it's familiar to many people here as well. The saying was this: 'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.' I think that proverb is a good illustration of what a government is all about. When you're here in the parliament to get things done, you need to operate as a team. If you want to pass legislation through the House of Representatives, you need to convince 75 of your colleagues to support you. It's quite easy to go fast—that is, to yell, criticise and offer solutions—but it's very hard to go far because to go far you need to go together. It means you need to cooperate with people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, government is about delivering for our communities. It's about keeping people safe. It's about giving people the opportunities to educate themselves, engage in livelihoods, run their own businesses. It's about giving them the freedom, and protecting that freedom, to make their own life choices. Government isn't about telling people how they should live their lives or deciding what choices they should be making; government is an enabling function to allow people to make those choices for themselves. I think we've been reminded of that this week, and the African proverb, 'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together,' is something I keep firmly in my mind.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  Every second day the Prime Minister comes into this place or comes before a camera and says that his No. 1 priority is to keep Australians safe. And yet he is spectacularly failing in that duty by pouring fuel on the climate fire; by using our money—public money!—and giving it to big gas corporations to open up new fields and pipelines. Floods are building up from the Great Dividing Range and Queensland and New South Wales and heading down to the ocean as we speak. At the same time, the government have released a gas plan to open up four giant new basins with 11 new and expanded gas pipelines. Now, this plan isn't for Australian homes and businesses; it is for their corporate donors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is enough gas in the dwindling supplies of the Bass Strait to last us over the decade as we undertake switching homes and businesses from gas and electricity to renewables. If there's enough gas in the system at the moment to help us through the transition, why is the government doing this? This is a plan for three big gas consortia exporting our gas from Gladstone who contracted to sell way more gas than they can deliver to their customers in Asia. The government are riding to the rescue, saying they will detonate four huge climate bombs just to appease big corporations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the centre of their gas plan lies the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory, which the Northern Territory Labor government is opening up. The gas basins in the Northern Territory are huge. In the Northern Territory there is the equivalent of 68 years worth of Australia's pollution locked up there. People have heard about Adani. The Beetaloo project is much bigger and much worse for the climate than Adani.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday in the Senate we lost our chance to stop $50 million of public money flowing into the pockets of the big gas corporations that want to open up the Territory to fracking. The Greens had secured the crossbench votes we needed to block public money going to these big tax-dodging corporations. The only vote we needed was the Australian Labor Party's and it went and voted with the Liberals instead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have two parties who now hold identical positions: net zero pushed out to 2050—that happy place where delay has become denial—while simultaneously opening up one of Australia's biggest ever gas fields—a climate bomb. We can't reduce emissions and increase pollution at the same time. So which one do the Liberal and Labor parties actually want? The promise of net zero made in the United Nations and in Glasgow, or opening up 116 new coal and gas fields that are currently in the pipeline?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Glasgow the world said, 'No more coal and gas.' Less than three weeks after the most important climate summit in a decade, the Liberals and Labor voted to give $50 million of public money, that could be going to schools and hospitals instead, to open up the Beetaloo gas fields in the Northern Territory and release a plan for four massive new gas fields. Gas is as dirty as coal. Beetaloo is worse than Adani. And Beetaloo itself will drive Australia's emissions up by up to 13 per cent a year! We're talking about getting out. We're talking about terrible 2030 targets from the government. This is lifting Australia's pollution by 13 per cent because of how much it leaks and how much is required just to convert this into liquefied natural gas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals and Labor have ignored the rest of the world. They are putting a safer climate out of reach. They both backed more gas in Beetaloo and Scarborough and Barossa and Galilee and Bowen basins—so much gas that it will lead us to a catastrophic world of 3½ degrees of warming. When these political parties back more gas, that means they back more fires, more floods, more heatwaves and more droughts. If you don't have a plan to phase out coal and gas, you don't have a plan to tackle the climate crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this happening mere weeks after Glasgow? As always, the answer is money. Because what the Liberal and Labor parties do have is a plan to protect the coal and gas corporations that they take donations from. Even when these donors don't pay any tax, they take the donations and then the corporations get to write the climate policy. It is time for this to end. No more handouts to these big corporations. No more public cash for coal and gas. No more paying big corporations to pollute. No more sending profits offshore tax-free like these big corporations do. No more mine approvals for mates and donors. No more cushy fossil fuel jobs for ex-politicians. The only acceptable plan is one that says no more coal and gas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens won't take donations from big coal and gas. We will put the people first. We will make sure public money is spent on schools and hospitals and tackling the climate crisis. We will fight for our future. It is becoming clearer by the day that the only way to get climate action in this country is to kick this climate-denying Liberal government out and put the Greens in the balance of power, to push the next government to start phasing out coal and gas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also rise to mark the UN International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. The Greens recognise the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination and a future built on peace, dignity, justice and security. In Palestine, as you travel from town to town and move along crowded roads, from time to time you look across to see other, faster-moving, more modern roads cutting through areas that make up the lands widely recognised as forming part of Palestine. But Palestinians are not allowed on these roads. Similarly, you visit refugee camps, as I did, where people tell you of their families forced from their own homes a few decades ago, and, even though these homes are still standing, in some instances kilometres away, their families were never allowed to return, and nor are the people still living in camps. You go to universities and you hear that basic things that we take for granted here, like people being able to get to class on time, are regularly disrupted because a student coming to sit their exam, say, has been stopped at another checkpoint and delayed for hours—a checkpoint that sits in the middle of their homeland but is not controlled by them. As an Australian, you see water tanks on the roofs of Palestinian flats and houses and think it's about collecting falling rainwater, but then the locals tell you it is so that they can scavenge some water on the day that it's flowing to their towns, because it may not be flowing to them the next day, when they want to cook or clean, because their water system is not controlled by them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All people have the right to peace, justice and freedom, and we want to see those rights valued equally for all. But, for decades, Palestinians have lived under occupation, and they are denied these rights. Israelis are entitled to their own state and to live in peace and security, but so too are Palestinians. Australia should recognise Palestine and advocate meaningfully for an end to the occupation, including ceasing the expansion of settlements and ending the Gaza blockade so that Palestinians and Israelis can live in a just and lasting peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peace also means supporting civil society, democracy and transparency, but a few short weeks ago, according to Human Rights Watch, the Israeli government: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Statements of solidarity have come from human rights organisations in Israel and from around the world. The European Union, importantly, has seen the alleged evidence and has chosen to continue to fund these organisations. Here in Australia we support the statement signed by 70 organisations, including unions and faith, legal and human rights organisations, calling on the Australian government to condemn the move. As UN special rapporteurs and the International Commission of Jurists have said, the Israeli government should immediately review and reverse its decision.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this day I also note the case of Mr El Halabi, Gaza's World Vision manager, who was arrested in 2016 and, after 50 days in Israeli state detention, was charged with diverting aid funding, which he strongly denies. Since he was arrested, World Vision has commissioned a forensic audit, which found no evidence of diversion of funds. An investigation by Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade failed to show any evidence that the money was diverted. We support the call from UN special rapporteurs that Mr El Halabi should be given a fair trial or else released immediately.</span>

The past two years have provided great challenges for our business community, with the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in the most severe global economic crisis since the Great Depression. In April 2020, more than one million Australians lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero. However, with strong progress on the vaccine rollout there has been light at the end of the tunnel, and, as of March this year, Australia became the first advanced economy to have more people in employment than prior to the pandemic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that small business is the backbone of our economy and the key to Australia's economic recovery. This is why our small business community deserves to be celebrated. The business awards were originally started by the Logan Chamber of Commerce over 35 years ago. It has a tradition of being the night of nights in the Logan business and social calendar, with 15 industry category awards and six major awards up for grabs. It's an honour for any business to receive a nomination. This year, six businesses from my electorate were celebrated for their business contribution to our local community. The 2021 major award winner for inclusiveness was local Beenleigh business the Empire Bodyshop, founded in 2016. The 2021 industry category awards range over a diverse number of industries, and this year's winners include AKIPS, the White House of Waterford, MyCity Logan, Transit Care and Laser Tag in a Box. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AKIPS is a network-monitoring software company, and they took out the Technology and Innovation Award. AKIPS has developed the world's largest scaling network and infrastructure monitoring software, which services some of the most high-profile organisations across the world. AKIPS software allows network engineers to be proactive instead of firefighting and to detect, analyse and rectify issues before any disruption to the business occurs. AKIPS was founded in Logan, and it currently operates out of a corporate office in my electorate, in Tanah Merah. The AKIPS team has rapidly expanded over the last few months, and is led by Susan Koch, the general manager—her husband, Paul, sadly passed away earlier this year—along with Nick Frampton and Mark Birkinshaw. I congratulate them on the success that they've achieved over this short period of time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The event services category award was awarded to the White House of Waterford for creating amazing dining experiences and memorable events. They have a focus on locally sourced produce, high-quality service and delicious food, to serve the Logan community and strive to bring the best of Australian hospitality and cuisine to Logan. MyCity Logan is a news outlet that took the win for media and advertising. They strive to deliver the most comprehensive news updates and provide opportunities to advertise local businesses. MyCity Logan is a trusted source of everything Logan related. Whether you want to read the latest headline, catch up on local events, look for the perfect weekend food spot or local business or search for a good property location, they have all your needs covered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Transit Care was the winner of the For Purpose (Charity and Not For Profits) Award. They are dedicated to providing safe, reliable and professional transport to those people in the community who have difficulty getting around. Their pre-booked, door-to-door service allows community members to travel to medical and social supports and appointments. They also offer fun social activities—including bus trips to interesting and beautiful locations, fitness classes, arts and crafts, and technology courses—to foster connection, participation and inclusion. The sports category award, which I was a sponsor of, was awarded to Laser Tag in a Box, a business that aims to provide a full day of fun, laughter and adrenaline. Laser Tag in a Box rents laser tag party gear Australia wide, right to your door. Everything you need comes in the box and provides hours of entertainment with minimal stress. It's perfect for birthday parties, sporting team celebrations and youth programs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only do we have these amazing businesses in my electorate of Forde; the community can also celebrate the outstanding achievements of many representatives in the sporting arena. The City of Logan Sports Awards pay tribute to elite athletes and inspirational sportspeople. The awards also recognise our homegrown sporting icons whose accomplishments have seen them reach the highest level in their chosen sport, and this year is no different with another successful year for our sports men and women across the electorate of Forde. Logan Basketball, who are based in Shailer Park, were awarded the 2021 City of Logan Sports Awards organisation of the year. This award culminates in a huge year of success for Logan Basketball both on and off the court across various levels and programs. This is a well deserved win for the organisation, and I commend their players, coaches, officials, volunteers, staff and the management committee for all the hard work they have put in to achieving such great success. It was an honour on the night to see Marsden State High School with a number of both current and former students being recognised for their sporting contributions. Marsden State High School open boys rugby league team won sports team of the year. Ms Bartlett won sports coach of the year and judge's choice, and Ms Neumann took out the sports official of the year. Students Losa Niumata and Connor Gillen won sportswoman and sportsman of the year, and former Marsden State High School student and Olympic gold-medallist Logan Martin was honoured with the golden banksia award. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to these many organisations, there are also the everyday clubs all around Logan that are run by volunteers who make such an outstanding effort each and every year to ensure that our kids, from under-fives all the way to our senior teams, can get out on the field and play their chosen sport. I want to congratulate and commend the businesses of Forde together with our sporting men and women for being honoured with these awards. They have worked hard and dedicated themselves through the tough times over the past couple of years. They are a credit to our community for their perseverance and dedication to their businesses and to their chosen sports, and I congratulate them all. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="140590" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  One of the most important and significant communities I'm honoured to represent in this parliament is the community made up of many thousands of Australians who have Vietnamese heritage. Springvale has long been the heartland for Vietnamese Victorians. It's a place that I have lived in and that I have represented at a local government level, and now I have the great privilege of representing Springvale in this federal parliament. More than 20 per cent of the people who live in that suburb alone in my electorate are of Vietnamese heritage. The journey that's brought many of these families to Australia is simply an extraordinary one. Many Vietnamese Australians I represent either themselves or their parents or grandparents fled Vietnam after the civil war. Many were stuck in refugee camps in South-East Asia for years at a time and came to Australia with nothing but the clothes on their back. What this community has achieved in just two generations in our country is incredible, and I feel so humbled to represent people who have been able to make so much of the amazing opportunities that Australia offers. When I go around my community, it literally hums with the life of religious, social and professional activities that are being generated by these amazing people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This community is supported by a number of incredible local organisations, and I want to talk about some of them. One of those is the South Eastern Melbourne Vietnamese Associations Council, called SEMVAC, which is a council that support all the not-for-profit organisations that support Vietnamese Australians in the region. They make an enormous contribution to social harmony and by providing direct service delivery through an amazing network of volunteers, people of Vietnamese heritage who reach out to people within their community to try to support and assist them. One of the areas where SEMVAC has most recently been most involved is through the vaccination efforts, and the volunteers have done amazing work to ensure that this core part of my community is able to access the vaccine. SEMVAC is led by Loc Lam and a group of amazing committee members and, as I mentioned, this large network of volunteers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another organisation I really want to point to is the Springvale Indochinese Mutual Assistance Association, also known as SICMAA, which is an organisation we could not do without in the local area. SICMAA has been servicing the local community for 39 years and it's an organisation that I've had the honour of being associated with for a long time, since I was a councillor in the City of Greater Dandenong. Their president, Be Ha, is a force to be reckoned with. Be is absolutely one of my idols and has led this organisation for a long time. They provide an unbelievable service to the people of the south-east, in particular, of Vietnamese origin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Vietnamese Women's Association Springvale is another wonderful organisation headed by their founder, CEO and honorary secretary Cam Nguyen. Cam and her family came to Australia in 1975 as refugees and founded the Vietnamese Friendly Society, which initially provided interpreting services and information about Australia to new Vietnamese refugees. She was honoured this year as the Victorian state recipient of the award for Senior Australian of the Year, which was so well-deserved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention the Vietnamese Australian seniors association and Nancy Skorin, who is a dear friend of mine and a brilliant leader. Overseeing all of these organisations is the Vietnamese Community in Australia Victorian Chapter, which is so well led by Phong Nguyen, and is a hugely dynamic organisation right across Victoria. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note how crucial these organisations are. They provide essential services and support any time in Victoria. However, during the pandemic, the role that these organisations have played has been crucial. We've had a real issue in Victoria getting into communities where English isn't the first language spoken, and these organisations have been an essential in ensuring that correct information has been getting out to Vietnamese families and making sure people understand that the available vaccines are safe and trying to help us bring vaccination rates up for these constituents of mine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of the Vietnamese Australians who I represent still feel very deep ties back to Vietnam, either because they have friends and family there or through their cultural ties. Something that's constantly raised with me as I move around my electorate is the very serious distress that a lot of Vietnamese Australians feel about the human rights abuses that are taking place in Vietnam at the moment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know a lot of Australians have probably visited Vietnam. I'm not sure if they are aware of the staggering differences between the political systems in Vietnam and in Australia. The very basic freedoms that we enjoy as Australians—freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of association—are not guaranteed for the people of Vietnam. There isn't an independent media in Vietnam, so the government controls TV, radio, newspapers and other publications, and Vietnamese citizens are not entitled to join organisations, labour unions, political associations or human rights organisations the way that you and I can in Australia. This is not some problem of the past which is slowly resolving over time. Human Rights Watch in their most recent report said, 'Vietnam's human rights record remains dire in all areas.' What we see in so many countries like this is that the people who are persecuted the most are those who are trying to fight the system and speak out for their basic freedoms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most concerning things about the situation in Vietnam is the unfair imprisonment of a lot of these activists who are fighting for a fairer and more just society in Vietnam. Human Rights Watch found in 2021 alone that authorities prosecuted and imprisoned at least 31 people just for expressing opinions online that were contrary to the government's positions. Pham Doang Trang is one such person—an incredible woman. If you have an interest in this area, I encourage you to google and learn about this amazing woman who has advocated very strongly for the rights of women and for a Vietnamese democracy. She has been imprisoned again recently in Vietnam. She has been horribly violated and left disabled by the security forces but is someone who doesn't turn away because of those things. This is a strength of this activism—someone who is willing to continue to stand up and fight for what she believes in, despite the fact that she knows that she's going to face these kinds of outcomes in Vietnam. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chau Van Kham's case is one that I know has been raised in the parliament before, because Chau Van Kham is an Australian, an Australian of Vietnamese heritage. He is serving a 12-year prison sentence for simply expressing peaceful political beliefs in Vietnam. He was arrested for, amongst other things, being a member of a political party. Deputy Speaker, can you imagine the freedom that you and I feel to join a political party, to express the beliefs that we are entitled to express in a democracy? In Vietnam, someone doing that basic act can end up in prison for 12 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find the bravery of these activists incredible. It's one thing to see people protesting on the streets in Australia, which they are very much entitled to do, but imagine having the inner strength to do that in a country like Vietnam, where you know that you are going to get hunted down by the authorities and punished for simply stating a point of view. What we know is that the judicial system in Vietnam is not going to ensure free and fair trials for these activists. They get detained and they are put away essentially without proper evidence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things I need to mention, which is very disturbing, is the way that the Vietnamese government has restricted religious practices through legislation and different types of surveillance. The Khmer Krom Buddhist Temple and the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam are good examples. These are churches, people expressing religious beliefs, who face more or less constant surveillance and intimidation for exercising this basic human right. In Australia we value those basic human rights. We seek to protect them here in Australia. But what I'm concerned about is the silence on these issues, on what's happening in Vietnam, from the federal government. When faced with these incredibly serious problems in Vietnam, some of which are even affecting Australians who are in Vietnam, what has the Australian government done? Essentially, they've done nothing. That is not good enough. We hear nothing from the government. We don't hear these things being properly condemned. We don't hear the voice of Australians out in the world, making it clear that these things are unacceptable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the federal government to stand up for human rights. We owe it to our friends in the region. Importantly for me, we owe it to the thousands of people of Vietnamese heritage that I represent for whom these issues are absolutely crucial. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  As we come to the end of the year, I rise tonight to look back on the last 12 months. It hasn't been easy, and we've certainly faced our fair share of challenges. But, with the support of our government, Australia has moved forward to secure its recovery, and now we're setting our sights on reopening to the world. We know the best way to stay safe right now is by getting vaccinated. In Queensland, there are 76 per cent of us now fully vaccinated. Australia is leading the world in our response to the pandemic. We have some of the highest vaccination rates, we are one of the most prepared to deal with outbreaks and variants, and our economic recovery is unrivalled. Jobs are coming back. Unemployment nationwide is at a 12-year low. I've seen many businesses in Bonner benefiting from how we've been able to deliver jobs. In fact, over 5,000 businesses in my electorate have taken advantage of JobKeeper since the start of the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the year I've spent time visiting local businesses and their staff, from Mount Gravatt's badminton espresso and Rochedale's Cache Cache cafe to local Aussie manufacturers like Murarrie's Cyborg Dynamics Engineering and Wynnum's Couplemate trailer parts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also reducing our emissions whilst growing our economy. We're delivering a balanced approach to achieve this through our commitment to securing our fuel sovereignty. This is happening in Bonner at the Ampol refinery in Lytton, with a package securing 550 direct and local jobs. It's backed by our expanded $250 million Future Fuels Fund investment, which empowers consumers to drive the car that they want. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're delivering for better roads, faster commutes and making sure Australians can get home sooner and safer. We've invested a further $1 billion into road safety upgrades, to save lives, and a further $1 billion in local road infrastructure projects. In Bonner, long-awaited upgrades to the Linden crossing are underway. I've been fighting for this upgrade since 2017, when over 7,000 locals in Bonner signed my petition to fix Linden crossing. We were successful, and in 2019 our government committed $85 million to this worthy project. This month we commenced the first stage of safety upgrades to the crossing. I recently invited Assistant Minister for Road Safety and Freight Transport Scott Buchholz onsite to see the progress made to date, and I look forward to welcoming him back when the works are complete.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is home to the Newnham Road and Wecker Road intersection, and I'm proud to have secured $12 million in funding for this project to make the intersection safer, which will be delivered by the Brisbane City Council, with works currently underway. Our government has also allocated $40 million to fixing the notorious Rochedale roundabout, which will improve the safety of commuters and cater for future traffic demands in this growing suburb. There's also the $15 billion Inland Rail project connecting Melbourne to Brisbane. Currently, plans have it terminating at Acacia Ridge in Brisbane's southern suburbs. This means freight for the port of Brisbane must be trucked in on existing roads—unless a dedicated Inland Rail link is created. That's why I'm fighting to deliver a dedicated underground freight rail connection between the Inland Rail and the port of Brisbane. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to health, this year I have spoken in the House on multiple occasions about spinal muscular atrophy, also known as SMA, which, sadly, occurs in one in 10,000 births in Australia. With no cure, this disease is the No. 1 genetic cause of death for babies under two. But Queensland is one of the few remaining states left that don't include screening for SMA as part of its newborn bloodspot screening program, and I've been calling the Queensland government to account, sharing the stories of families in my electorate whose little ones are currently battling this disease, like Kate and Grant Gough's beautiful girl Oakley, who was diagnosed at eight weeks old. Life-saving testing exists and has been rolled out in other states, while the Queensland government continues to stand idle. I will continue to speak up for these families because no child should be disadvantaged by where they are born this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian has the right to be safe. That's why our government remains committed to ending all forms of violence against women and children. Since we came to government, we have invested more than $1 billion to keep women and children safe, and this year we invested a further $1.1 billion in women's safety. I've been working closely alongside many hardworking services in our area, like Carina's Beyond DV and the Small Steps for Hannah Foundation, who provide dedicated support to women and children, helping them to escape violence and abuse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year I unveiled my plan to deliver more mental health services on Bonner's bay side. It was launched through a bay-side mental health survey which collected over 500 anonymous responses and highlighted the needs of locals. I kept up the momentum by convening the Bayside Mental Health Working Group, involving local mental health and community providers. This group has since met on multiple occasions, bringing these important voices together and determining how we can fill the urgent gaps in our area. I've also shared my plans with the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, David Coleman, who has provided his support. Currently I'm working with the Brisbane South PHN on a mental health plan that is intended to be tailored to the youth of the bay side.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, Bonner celebrated the return of our iconic Wynnum Fringe Festival, which took place over six jam-packed days this month. Festival founder Tom Oliver has once again outdone himself. It was a true celebration of the arts, with the Morrison government proudly securing its return as an annual event by delivering $236,000 in funding. It has been another challenging year for our arts and creative sectors, but we're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also making a real difference to the lives of Australian families. I'm regularly visiting our local childcare centres and kindergartens, spending time with the staff and children, and learning what we can do to support them. During these visits I always read and donate <span style="font-style:italic;">If I Was Prime Minister</span> by Beck and Robin Feiner. Last month it was donated to the vibrant kindergarten class at C&amp;K St Catherine's Community Kindergarten in Wishart. The children loved the book so much that they created and sent me their own version, which told the story of what they would do if they were Prime Minister.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take this opportunity to recognise Bonner's amazing and hardworking school communities, who have demonstrated this resilience once again this year. I've brought Parliament House to several local schools through mock parliaments, where they debated topics such as whether junk food should be served in school cafeterias and whether Brisbane should host the 2032 Olympics—which we will now be doing. Bonner Youth Advisory Council also met each term this year, and we even kicked off a Junior BYAC for students in year 5 and year 6. It's so exciting to see our leaders of tomorrow in action.  It's been a big year, but our government has continued to deliver across all sectors for all people in all of our communities.</span>
