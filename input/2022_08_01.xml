                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ending Indefinite and Arbitrary Immigration Detention Bill 2022 abolishes unlawful mandatory detention of asylum seekers and refugees. It provides that community alternatives to immigration detention will always be preferred to detention wherever possible. It ensures that those in alternatives to immigration detention have full access to housing, financial support, the right to work, education, health care and other government services as required under international law. Moreover, it contains specific conditions on how and why a person can be detained, and it disallows long-term and arbitrary detention by setting limited time frames to ensure that an individual's detention period is as short as possible. In other words, the bill removes the abhorrent and torturous conditions that detainees currently experience by ensuring their access to information and services. Importantly, under this bill, every decision is subject to independent oversight and prompt review and, unlike Australia's current immigration detention policy, this bill complies with international law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the second time I have sought to progress this bill in the House. In fact, during the previous parliament, I tried unsuccessfully, but I was pleased to see that it was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. I suggest it is very significant that that committee received well over 400 submissions from members of the community and from groups, and the overwhelming majority of the submissions were strongly supportive of the bill, including submissions from UNHCR, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, Amnesty, Rural Australians for Refugees, Grandmothers for Refugees and hundreds of other concerned individual Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is needed, and frankly it's needed urgently, because we face the bizarre and outrageous situation in this country where someone, in some circumstances, can be detained indefinitely, without charge and without having been found guilty of anything. In particular, if someone is a citizen of another country but can't be returned to that other country, they can effectively be kept in prison in Australia until the day they die. It's that straightforward, and it is abhorrent. I hardly need to explain why that is abhorrent, but I will. Clearly this arrangement in Australia is immoral. It is immoral to deny someone their liberty—to keep them in cruel conditions in what is really a punitive arrangement. It's as simple as that. It's also clearly at odds with international law. In fact in the Rome Statute, it is a crime against humanity to detain someone indefinitely. Not only is it in the Australian statutes that someone can be kept in an immoral manner, but we are basically showing a terrible indifference and arrogance to international law by having this in our books in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think many Australians think that the issue of boat people, asylum seekers, people being held in detention has come and gone, and that there aren't any or many people being held in detention, but I would remind the community through you, Mr Speaker, that as of 31 March 2022 there were 1,512 people held in immigration detention facilities in Australia. I'll say that again: as of March 2022, 1,512 people were held in immigration detention facilities in Australia. There were a further 563 people living in community detention and 10,993 people, so-called illegal maritime arrivals, living in the community after being granted bridging visas. Moreover, there are still 200 asylum seekers in offshore detention, which is effectively imprisonment. Even though, at face value, the people on, say, Nauru are free to go about their lives in that tiny country, it's such a tiny island it's effectively a gulag—no better than the gulags on the Thames a couple of hundred years ago. The average time for people to be held in detention facilities is 700 days. In fact there are some who have been held in offshore detention for over nine years. This is a very real and pressing issue in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is it immoral to be holding people in these circumstances, not only is it inconsistent with international law to be keeping people in these circumstances, it's just breathtaking the scale of this. We're not talking a couple of dozen people; we're talking many thousands of people. And not only is it illegal and immoral, it's also downright expensive. Mr Speaker, did you know it costs approximately $362,000 per year to hold someone in immigration detention? And an eye-watering $460,000 to keep a person in hotel detention. In contrast, it only costs about $4,500 for a refugee or an asylum seeker to live in the community on a bridging visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you add it all up, offshore detention costs approximately $1 billion per year—indeed, the federal government has spent close to $10 billion on offshore processing since July 2013. Case study: the cost of keeping the Tamil family on Christmas Island before they were mercifully returned to Biloela was more than $7 million. There is no way in the world this sort of expenditure can be defended, especially when there are alternatives to this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are clearly alternatives to this, and I would remind honourable members that I have twice unsuccessfully moved the Refugee Protection Bill, which would have enabled the establishment of a network of centres located in and run by Asia-Pacific countries, including Australia, where asylum seekers can go to be registered, have their immediate humanitarian needs met and where they can lodge a preference for a country of resettlement. And if those people select Australia, and if it's within our specified quota, then my bill establishes a process for assessing their claim in Australia with appropriate oversight, limited time frames and judicial review. My point is: there are alternatives to the way we do business. We just need to open our eyes and our minds, and to stop this pig-headed response by both the government and the opposition, who want to look tough on so-called border security when, in fact, we should be looking compassionately at a humanitarian challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now invite the member for North Sydney, who is seconding the bill, to offer a few comments in my remaining two minutes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  I second the motion. I thank the member for Clark for introducing the Ending Indefinite and Arbitrary Immigration Detention Bill 2022, and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this vital issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's immigration regime is unique in the world. It is uniquely cruel. In conflict with international law, Australia's migration system allows people to be kept in detention indefinitely. This bill seeks to bring an end to that cruelty. That cruelty comes at a vast financial cost, as has been outlined by the member for Clark, and devastating human costs. The damage to the physical and mental health of people caught in this system, including children, is well documented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, as part of the We're Better Than This campaign, together with a wider group of prominent Australians from business, the arts, academia, sport and religion, I condemned the conditions in which children were being detained, particularly on the islands of Nauru and Christmas Island. We won, and 276 kids got out of detention. But due to a lack of action from successive governments, the cruelty persists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is holding more than 1,500 people in immigration detention onshore. Some have been there for more than a decade and, as we heard from the member for Clark, the average length of detention is currently 700 days. This compares to about 55 days in the US and 14 days in Canada. We are a global outlier, locking people up on a mandatory basis and without time limits. Offshore more than 200 people remain stuck in Nauru or Papua New Guinea, with many more transferred to Australia, their lives in limbo. Politics has failed here. Instead of taking responsibility, Australia will take up valuable US and New Zealand resettlement places—yet even these deals will not provide solutions for everyone caught in our costly offshore regime. This bill would put a stop to the cruelty, and I commend it to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the overwhelming majority of people who call the territories home, I introduce this very simple but long-overdue legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I present a private member's bill for an act to amend the law in relation to the legislative powers for the territories and for related purposes. In short, this private member's bill is to restore the right of self-determination to the people and to the parliaments of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory was the first jurisdiction in the world to legislate voluntary assisted dying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a quarter of a century ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former member for Menzies was successful in his efforts to block the Territory's law a year later, also ensuring that the ACT would similarly not be able to legislate on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since what became commonly known as the Andrews ban came into effect, many jurisdictions around the world have debated and legislated on voluntary assisted dying, including all six states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even though he has left the parliament, the NT and the ACT remain gagged and bound by the former member for Menzies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the third time I have worked with colleagues to bring forward a bill to overturn that ban. In the previous parliament, that was with my friend the member for Fenner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Prime Minister, Minister Burke and my other colleagues for understanding the importance of putting this bill forward in the first sitting period of this new government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At its heart, what I and the member for Canberra are seeking to do in this private member's bill, with the full support of our territory Labor members and senators, is to simply and directly reverse the Andrews ban.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not legislate voluntary assisted dying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is about democratic equality and fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long, Australians living in the territories have been treated as second-class citizens when it comes to legislating on matters that impact their own lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's well past time for that to end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is called the Restoring Territory Rights Bill because that is all it seeks to do—to level the democratic playing field and restore legislative rights to our territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As federal legislators, it is not our role, when it comes to voting on this bill, to treat it as a vote by proxy for or against voluntary assisted dying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not our responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That responsibility lies with the members of the NT and ACT legislative assemblies, should they choose to draft legislation on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This private member's bill restores the democratic rights of citizens in the territories by removing a constraint on the legislative authority of their elected representatives which does not exist anywhere else in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in Australia in 1996 were not ready for the reality of voluntary assisted dying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is important to note that this bill does not automatically revive and restore the NT's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That act is null and void.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But now, in 2022, this bill is to ensure that the parliaments of both the NT and the ACT, and the people they represent, can interrogate the issue in a time and in a manner of their choosing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, if they do choose to legislate on this matter, they will have the full advantage of being able to draw on the legislative legwork done by all the Australian states, plus that of other nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many who have concerns about euthanasia and voluntary assisted dying, and I respect those concerns.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My personal priority is for improved and strengthened palliative care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principle here is that those dying of a terminal illness should have the right to a dignified and compassionate death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And any future voluntary assisted dying legislation must have strong safeguards to protect the vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compassion must be exercised in all directions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But these are issues for the legislative assemblies to consult on draft legislation for and to decide. It will be up to them. I am sure that they will make sure that their constituencies fully understand these issues before legislating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have other colleagues in this place who have similar concerns to mine, for reasons relating to their faith and other issues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think where we are united is in knowing that our support of this bill does not automatically confer support for voluntary assisted dying.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are simply righting an old wrong and ensuring that all Australians have equal democratic rights.</span>

It has been an honour to work with you on this private member's bill, the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022, in solidarity with our Northern Territory colleagues the member for Lingiari and Senator Malarndirri McCarthy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022 our democracy is not equal, because some Australians don't have the rights to debate a certain issue, simply because of where they live. Some Australians don't have rights simply because they live in the ACT and the Northern Territory. In 1997 the parliament moved what has become known as the Andrews bill, in response to the Northern Territory legislating for voluntary assisted dying, to prevent the territories from making such legislation. For 25 years we have been unable to have that debate, and in that 25 years all other Australian states have passed legislation in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For 25 years Canberrans have stood up in this place, and outside of it, to advocate to have the same democratic rights. It is on their behalf that I second this bill. I second it on behalf of my ACT federal Labor colleagues: the member for Fenner, who has moved several bills like this in the past; the member for Bean, like me elected in 2019, who has stood up for the rights of his constituents to have this debate; and Senator Katy Gallagher, who has advocated for territory rights for over 20 years, including as Chief Minister of the ACT. Our ACT Chief Minister, Andrew Barr, and Minister for Human Rights, Tara Cheyne, have campaigned long and hard to raise awareness of the need for the federal parliament to allow these rights for our territory, and I'm very pleased that they can join us today. I hope that this time our federal parliament will do this for our citizens of the ACT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Voluntary assisted dying is an issue with strong views on either side of the discussion and implications for many. It is a debate that we really need to have and we should be allowed to have. This bill would enable us to do that. This parliament has tried many times to do this over the years. As well as my Labor colleagues, I want to acknowledge Senators Lyn Allison, Bob Brown, Richard Di Natale and David Leyonhjelm, who have moved bills like this in the past. I'm proud that all representatives of the ACT in the federal parliament support territory rights, including Senator David Pocock, and I welcome his advocacy and support on this issue. I also want to acknowledge the support of our territories minister, Kristy McBain, on this important issue and of our leadership for allowing this important debate in the parliament, particularly in the very first sittings of the new Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to urge members of this parliament to please support this private member's bill. Those in the states may not have had cause to think about this much before, but, for Canberrans and Northern Territorians, this is personal and this is urgent. This is an incredibly important debate that we are not allowed to have, simply because of where we live. It is well past time that we had the same rights as those across our borders to debate this issue. I do deeply respect the views on either side of the discussion. I know that many of my colleagues I've spoken to may not support voluntary assisted dying but they do support our right to have the debate. As the member for Solomon has said, it's not our responsibility in the federal parliament to decide on that issue itself, but we should give the right to all Australians to have an equal right to the discussion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I urge my colleagues to please support this. Let this be the time that we right this historic wrong. Let this be the time that we deliver equal rights to Australians living in Canberra and living in the Northern Territory to discuss voluntary assisted dying. I do this on behalf of all the constituents who have raised this passionately with me, who feel that we are second-class citizens in Australia in 2022. I again urge our federal parliament to please deliver us the same rights.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) calls on the Government to ensure that these fundamental changes to the department will not reduce the operating budgets of our national security and law enforcement agencies.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing is more important or fundamental than the security of the Australian people, and the first and foremost job of government is to keep Australians safe. That was certainly my approach as the Minister for Home Affairs in the previous coalition government. Having served in that role, I have seen firsthand how the department and our national security and law enforcement agencies, that have traditionally worked together since the portfolio was formed, dedicate themselves to that task.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe one of the great strengths of the portfolio as it was previously structured was that it brought together our agencies in a powerful and a proactive manner. National security and law enforcement are of course intertwined. They always have been, but they are especially so with the rise of transnational serious organised criminal gangs that not only run criminal operations, trafficking drugs and firearms, but are often mercenaries for sale, engaged in espionage, terrorism and cyberwarfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The threats to our nation are more sophisticated and complex than ever before, which is why I was alarmed that one of the first acts of this government was to dismantle the Home Affairs portfolio, to put a raft of agencies, including the Australian Federal Police, AUSTRAC and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, under the Attorney-General's portfolio, effectively siloing them from ASIO, Australian Border Force and the department, which runs a range of policies including cybersecurity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am yet to see any justification for why they chose to gut the Home Affairs portfolio and perhaps during this debate Labor MPs will be able to enlighten us on that. I can't see how this improves the working relationships between our national security and law enforcement agencies and I can't see how this makes Australians safer. Perhaps there was no-one within the government that the Prime Minister felt had the depth of experience to manage the full portfolio. Maybe it was the outcome of factional negotiations. Whatever the reason or the reasons for that change they have never ever been articulated. But one thing I do know is that you shouldn't change such a critical portfolio on the basis of who gets a bigger share of the spoils of government. That's no way to run national security policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am deeply concerned, and we're seeing signs in a range of different policy areas, that the incoming government is driven by ego and ideology. Ideologically national security seems to be fairly low down the list of priorities for Labor. The national security policy that it took to the last election could fit on an A4 sheet of paper—leaving plenty of white space. Perhaps it doesn't have a national security agenda to speak of. Perhaps national security under the Labor government will be reactive rather than proactive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know that the last time they came into office they gutted the then immigration and customs portfolio to pay for their social spending promises. Perhaps that's their plan going forward. But I, along with others on this side of the chamber, will be watching closely how they allocate funds in the October budget. As we face increasing global uncertainty, we cannot afford to let our law enforcement and national security agencies wither.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud of the fact that the coalition provided record funding, including an extra $1.3 billion for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and boosting the Australian Federal Police's annual budget to more than $1.7 billion. I encourage any of the hardworking individuals within the Home Affairs portfolio, as it was, to contact my office if they find there are issues as a result of this move by the government. I will respect their confidentiality. We can't afford to be complacent in any way when it comes to the safety of our nation. I call on members of this place who share the very sensible view that the safety and security of Australians should be the priority of any government to support this motion.</span>

There were some fine words there from the member for McPherson, but in all the things the coalition do we should look at that yawning chasm between their fine words and their deeds, because this is the same person who, as a minister on election day, saw a complete compromising of Australia's security for short-term political gain. She has fled from the chamber now. Where was her voice on election day when we saw, for the sake of short-term political gain, an attempt to compromise those fine public servants who do keep Australia safe?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed that the member for McPherson kept using the word 'gutting' about public servants, when that is not what the Albanese government has done at all. It was only five years ago that Malcolm Turnbull crunched together Australia's immigration, border protection, law enforcement and domestic security agencies into the Home Affairs portfolio. Remember: this was a purely political reorganisation, not prompted by any obvious need or any demands of the public servants, the ones actually most affected by the changes. At the time, Nicholas Stuart wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span>:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bringing ASIO and the AFP together in one department and away from the Attorney-General was considered by some to be a fraught move. The Australian Federal Police Association has been calling for the AFP to be returned to the A-G's portfolio for a number of years. Remember that the police association are the actual people who understand policing and caring for police. That's why the Albanese government moved the AFP to the Attorney-General's portfolio. I am sorry that the person who moved the motion isn't here to listen to the response from the government MPs. She asked for it and then fled the chamber. This move was supported by the association, who have long held the view that the Commonwealth's law enforcement agency should be closely aligned with the portfolio that makes the laws in Australia. The police association has consistently argued for the Turnbull change to be reversed, saying that it compromised the AFP's organisational integrity and its ability to carry out investigations without government influence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure everybody remembers the compromised situation that the agency was placed in during the then Attorney-General Michaelia Cash's Australian Workers Union raid and the au pair cases. Do you remember those? In the case of the au pairs, Federal Police searched the offices of fellow portfolio agency the home affairs department. And who can forget that dastardly behaviour on election day, when the coalition compromised the integrity of border protection for short-term political expediency, to their great shame? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion from the member for McPherson does not call on the Albanese government to reverse these portfolio changes, but what it does is question the ability of our national security agencies to work collaboratively. It also implies that national security and intelligence agencies only started to cooperate with each other when the previous government created the Department of Home Affairs, completely ignoring the work of these agencies for the many, many years of collaboration under the Howard government, the Rudd government, the Gillard government and the Abbott government, all prior to the formation of Home Affairs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has complete confidence in the ability of the AFP to fight crime and to keep Australians safe. The Centre for Counter-Terrorism Coordination remains in the Department of Home Affairs and manages counterterrorism on behalf of the Commonwealth. It will now include delegated Attorney-General's Department officers in line with the administrative arrangements orders. The Albanese government will not treat national security as a political plaything. We will always respect and support our outstanding national security agencies and the men and women who actually keep Australia safe. We will not stand for the political interference shown by those opposite.</span>

                  </a>  Well, there you go, for the opposition members. But it is very interesting, because you said you've taken advice from police on whether the home affairs department should be disbanded. As a former police officer in Victoria counterterrorism policing, I actually took the guidance of former and acting, committed members of those who are here to protect the Australian community—those in the counterterrorism units, who strongly supported the move in 2017 to have a home affairs department all under one umbrella. In that role—and this is where it's so important, and I was proud to serve under the previous government as assistant minister—the department worked so well. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the member for Bruce that in 2019 that took into account assisting to ban bump stocks, which were sadly used in the Las Vegas mass killing over there. I'm sure the member for Bruce and other government members would support that ban. In April 2022 the Criminal Code amendments increased the maximum penalty for trafficking of firearms from 10 to 20 years and increased the mandatory minimum sentence to five years imprisonment. One of the policies we put in place that I am proudest of—and I again thank Crime Stoppers—was to launch a permanent national firearms amnesty. Nearly 12,000 firearms have been handed in. I hope the government continues to fund it—I'm sure the member for Bruce will take this forward—because it is ongoing and supports Crime Stoppers. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to community safety, one of my great concerns was high-risk youth—those who fall out of the schooling system and those who get involved in gangs. There are so many fantastic organisations around Australia who haven't had the support, and we put $120 million in place to support that program. I'm hoping and nearly praying that the Albanese government will have this in the budget, because it's so important. In July 2018 the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce was set up and it has done an amazing job, with 214,000 illicit tobacco detections and seizures of more than 827 tonnes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I chaired the Joint Standing Committee on Migration's inquiry into the efficacy of the current regulation of Australian migration agents. We put in place a tiered system so that, for example, you wouldn't get someone with little experience going before the AAT and so that, also, you would have a supervised practice. The next cab off the rank was an independent commissioner looking after the entire migration visa system. One of my concerns with the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority, OMARA, was that it didn't have the laws in place to do the job, and that is very important. We also put in place a code of conduct in 2022. We put measures in place to combat modern slavery, including the Modern Slavery Act and the National Action Plan to Combat Modern Slavery, with $10 million to support organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the home affairs department, it is really sad what the new government has done. There was no reason to separate the department. It was doing such a magnificent job in the work it was doing. The No. 1 priority of any government is to protect its citizens. I know the member for Bruce now is on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and I recommend to him and the other government members that it is so important to give law enforcement the tools they need to protect Australians.</span>

I do acknowledge her genuine interest as a former minister, now shadow minister—long may she continue in that position—notwithstanding her bizarre speech and the pathetic politicisation of national security that we continue to hear from those opposite in and outside the chamber. Quite simply, the government's changes to Home Affairs and the national security administrative arrangements are an improvement, including by moving the Australian Federal Police and criminal law enforcement policy to the Attorney-General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contemporary times Australia has no doubt benefited from well-run and professional security and law enforcement agencies, and I thank them for their work over many years in keeping Australians safe. But given the motion raises implicit concerns or criticisms and what we have heard from those opposite, let's get a few facts out. The previous government's creation of Home Affairs was not properly considered and was largely a power grab by the now leader of the opposition. Let's be blunt: in a desperate bid to keep his own job, former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull caved in to pressure from Dutton, the now Leader of the Opposition. He and the secretary then piled the Australian Federal Police, ASIO and anything else they could get in a smash-and-grab raid into a super security agency. The changes were rushed and half-baked, and they were opposed by cooler, wiser heads in the cabinet then, including Julie Bishop, and Malcolm, of course, until he caved in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Malcolm's desperation to stave off the now Leader of the Opposition was doomed to failure. In his own words, 'you cannot negotiate with terrorists'—in this case, of course, the political kind. They never like to talk about whatever happened to poor old Malcolm, do they? But the changes to Home Affairs made by the former government broke the long and prudent practice of properly constituted reviews done before major changes are made to administrative oversight and coordination of law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies. Turnbull's 2017 review did not recommend the creation of Home Affairs; neither did—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, governments should only make changes that strengthen national security, addressing critical deficiencies without needlessly distracting agencies. Both previous speakers said they had heard no rationale, so let me state two important considerations that the smash-and-grab power raid to create Home Affairs did not give regard to. Firstly, there are principles of the Hope royal commissions in the 1970s and 1980s, affirmed in numerous reviews since, in the previous decades. I'll quote Dennis Richardson in the intelligence legislation review:</span>

              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">there should be a clear separation between those agencies responsible for the collection of security intelligence, and those responsible for policing and the enforcement of the law, to avoid creating the perception—or the reality—of a 'secret police'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the importance of collective cabinet level decision-making in our Westminster system of government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, there are many problems with the former government's arrangements. Firstly, the Leader of the Opposition's lust for power reduced contestability and diluted the Westminster system. Healthy contestability is enhanced by a principle of diffused power between ministries and authority between ministers, agencies and departments. Concentrating intelligence and law enforcement activities under one secretary and one minister, who is not even the first law officer, carries enormous risks. Serious policy attention should be brought to the cabinet to be debated and decided by democratically elected ministers. Trying to get a single position on major security issues in a superdepartment is inherently unhealthy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition's overconcentration of power posed risks to democracy. Far too much power was concentrated in one minister, one department and one secretary. Again, in a democracy this creates the risk of creating the conditions for a police state. Home Affairs became a national security elephant competing with the ONI's role in oversighting the national intelligence community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, as a consequence the Liberals hurt community trust—and that's critical, particularly when agencies are getting new and intrusive powers—especially under its initial leadership duo that drove an unhealthy culture seeking ever more power. But different leadership is not inherently enough of a safeguard and the government's changes rebalance things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the oversecuritisation of migration policy, which has hurt Australian families and the economy. Of course migration policy has critical security elements but it's also a key economic and social domain. Oversecuritisation combined with a toxic departmental culture and budget cuts has led to 'the department of human misery and economic carnage,' which we inherit with regard to its migration functions. It will certainly take more resources and, sadly, years to clear the visa backlogs that this mob built up. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span>) </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  I would like to thank the member for McPherson for bringing this motion to the House and, of course, I speak in favour of it. This is a fundamental issue to do with the structure of the national security of our nation, and a major change that the new government has, peculiarly, decided to put in place to dismantle the cooperation and coordination that we created in government through the creation of the Home Affairs department. Previous speakers have talked about the agencies that were brought together under that one single umbrella. In particular, to me, whilst many are reflecting on the past, I think the most important thing about the Home Affairs department are the challenges that we will face as a nation into the future that are still developing and emerging as we speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As technology changes and other capabilities change we will see agencies needing to work together more than ever before. Different complex criminal capabilities around cyber et cetera and new ways and technologies that criminal enterprises will have access to will mean that our agencies that exist in law enforcement and border protection—intelligence gathering—will need to have an ability to collaborate together in an even more enhanced way into the future, and that's why it's so disappointing and regrettable that we're taking this backward step in separating apart these agencies from one common department.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear, firstly, that these agencies are still standalone agencies. There is a Commissioner of the Federal Police, a Commissioner of Border Force and so on. The people who hold those roles are very distinguished people who are not, in my experience, at all susceptible to being bullied by a department head or being pushed around by anyone from the political class or from the departmental level. The independence of those agencies is one of the reasons that they are held in such high regard in this country and around the world. To suggest that by being in a department like Home Affairs the Federal Police Commissioner is in some way at risk of being subjugated by the head of that department and of not discharging their statutory responsibility is patently ridiculous. But what we are missing out on by dismantling this department is the natural opportunity for these agencies to have that enhanced level of collaboration in working together in a uniform structure within a single department. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've certainly had experience with cross-agency matters, both at the Commonwealth level and the state level in South Australia. Of course, all of our agencies are exceptional, but in times of emergency, such as national security matters—but even in times of emergency management et cetera—there is a very high value in taking every opportunity to bring different agencies together to work as closely together as they can when major challenges face the nation. That might be from a national security point of view. That might be from an emergency management or disaster relief point of view. The point is that by having all these agencies together in one department we gave ourselves the best chance of them working as collaboratively together as possible. What this decision by the new government says to me is that that is not their priority. There are clearly internal tensions within the government and between cabinet ministers that have meant that someone has to be given some of these agencies in their department so that they can feel some sense of more significance in the role that they hold than they would have if they didn't have those agencies allocated to them, but that should not be the priority when it comes to matters of national security. We should not be making decisions for the vanity benefit of particular ministers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Suggestions in this debate about super departments and the cabinet process are really a reflection of concerns that members opposite have about their own ministers. The suggestion that they couldn't trust a minister to hold a portfolio of Home Affairs and have all of those responsibilities under the one person, because apparently the culture in their government is that that person couldn't be trusted to operate within the confines of the Westminster system, couldn't be trusted to operate within the structures of cabinet government and couldn't be trusted to properly inform the Prime Minister and the National Security Committee of cabinet, is a reflection of the standards of the people that they've appointed to these positions in their government. But it's certainly regrettable that, because of that, the most important thing, which is the best national security interests of this nation, is being sat on the back seat to the challenges they've got in managing the personnel in their own cabinet. That suggests to me that the people in those positions should be reconsidered by the Prime Minister. He should reconstitute this department and he should prioritise the national security issues of this nation over any others.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I want to thank the member for McPherson for moving this motion, not for her overt politicised content of the motion—certainly not for that—but really for the entertainment value, for the gall, for the brazenness, for the chutzpah she demonstrated in waltzing into this chamber and bowling up such a politicised motion that was so true to form for that mob over there when they were in government and which continues for them in opposition. Remarkably, they just can't help themselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go on, I want to acknowledge the incredible work our national security agencies and the Department of Home Affairs play in keeping Australians safe and secure. Every day outstanding women and men across this portfolio protect us from those who would do us harm: terrorists, child sex offenders, violent extremists, traffickers, serious and organised crime groups and people smugglers. The Albanese Labor government is committed to supporting these men and women in their work. We respect them and we are grateful for the important work they do. The same cannot be said for those opposite. Why? In the past fortnight we have heard about how the former government and the former minister, the member for McPherson, disgracefully attempted to trash the impartiality of those very same public servants working to keep us safe. The former minister, on election day, 21 May, risked the lives of those people who are keeping our country safe, with one motivation only—not the success of the operation, not the safety of those involved, not the interests of Australia's national security or our national interest; no, their only motivation was political. This has been their hallmark, using our foreign policy, our national security and our national interest as a political football that they can kick around as long as they can to protect their own jobs. They acted only in their interests, the interests of the Liberal Party, in a pathetic, craven, last-ditch effort to hold onto government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government pressured public servants to make the ongoing operation public, leaked the operation to the media and then spammed voters with fearmongering text messages. In doing so, they showed nothing but utter disrespect and contempt for the uniformed officers that keep Australia and Australians safe. They put lives at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The department's report found that the former government sabotaged operational protocols that protect Operation Sovereign Borders for their own political gain. The findings of this report were shocking, but they weren't surprising to most of us over here, because the former government has consistently tried to politicise our national security and our law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Home Affairs. So it frankly beggars belief that the former minister is moving this motion given her conduct, and the conduct of her former Prime Minister, on election day. The opposition shouldn't be coming in here with this kind of motion. They should be coming in here and apologising to the Australian people, to our Border Force personnel and to the Department of Home Affairs staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this motion conveniently fails to mention the former government's budget cuts to the very national security and law enforcement agencies we are discussing. Those opposite spent years attempting to cut funding from the AFP, and even left our high-risk terrorist offender regime unfunded from the end of 2022-23. This idea that terrorism is an issue that would only last for a single year is absolutely laughable and says everything Australians need to know about the approach of those opposite to national security. This motion seeks to question the ability of our national security agencies to work collaboratively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, under our government, we have already made tangible changes in the interests of ensuring Australians are safe. All of the actions that we are taking are in the interests of our national security and in keeping Australians safe. This Labor government will not treat national security as a political plaything. We will not politicise them, we will not disrespect them and we will not compromise them. Unlike those opposite, we will always respect and support our outstanding national security agencies, because our objectives are aligned: they are Australia's national interest.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a national scourge that, on average, one woman dies every 10 days in Australia at the hand of their current or former intimate partner. We can't shy away from this reality in Australia today. It is unacceptable, it is despicable and it is to the shame of all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must work together to cease this terrible violence. The Albanese Labor government isn't wasting a minute, and we are taking action to tackle the barriers that prevent people from fleeing. It's not a matter of 'Where would she or he go?' or 'Why don't they just get out?' as we've often heard said. How do they do that? This is about the how. We can all walk a mile in someone's moccasins and say, 'Well, if that were me, I'd be gone.' You know what? The practicalities of that actual going can be so difficult and can be so fraught that people are in some way happier and masked in trying to keep their lives cobbled together and trying just put up with what's happening, rather than having another mountain to overcome and trying to stay safe. That's just one of the thought processes that people have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families across Australia now have a government that get it. They now have a government that's listening and working and taking swift action to ensure that the change that's necessary to help them get out of those violent situations is happening, not only for them at a personal level but also at a professional level, at the workplace. We are prioritising this important legislation to increase paid leave for family and domestic violence. We made a promise to the Australian people, and we're making good on that promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professionals across the community sector have long said that removing the barriers faced by those escaping violence is actually the key to ending the loss of life. Access to paid family and domestic leave, provided for in our legislation, will also positively engage the rights of women not to be discriminated against based on gender. This legislation is going to provide financial support to assist employees to manage the consequences of family and domestic violence. The retention of your job is an essential pathway out of violent relationships, and sustained periods of employment can provide financial security, as well as independence and social networks that increase self-esteem and really help people that are caught in these dreadful situations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make it not only easier but better all round. Where an employee would not otherwise have access to a leave entitlement to engage in these processes, the entitlement provided for in the fair work amendment will assist these employees by retaining employment and financial and personal benefits that come with that employment, particularly during these difficult times. We don't want to see another generation of men and women losing their lives through this kind of violence, and we want to support the employers too to see that it ends.</span>

                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  I rise to support the motion and thank the member for moving the motion and giving us the opportunity to address this very important issue in our country. Family and domestic violence is absolutely abhorrent. The statistics are terrible. The mover mentioned one of those statistics, which probably is the worst, that every 10 days someone loses their life at the hands of a current or former partner in this nation. That is absolutely atrocious, and we should take every opportunity in this place to do anything we can to assist to change that statistic for the better. I fear that, although we do have good data in this area in modern times, this is a problem that goes back throughout the history of humankind. It's good that we at least live in an era where we discuss this topic much more than we did in decades gone by. Whilst it is absolutely horrendous to see coverage of these matters in the media and to see the pain, torment and abuse, physical and emotional, that people are going through in a family and a domestic circumstance, at least by hearing about it we are aware of it much more than we were in the past, and it motivates us to look for every opportunity imaginable to alleviate it and to protect people that are in that terrible circumstance. The principle of paid family and domestic violence leave is one that I support and that I'm sure everyone in this parliament supports comprehensively. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, there has been an evolution in this policy area. It was back in 2018 that the former government moved amendments to the Fair Work Act under the National Employment Standards to bring in unpaid family and domestic violence leave. That was in similar circumstances to where we are right now, where there was a Fair Work Commission decision, which was relevant to people on an award. With the making of that decision, from an equity point of view it would have been ridiculous that the principle of leave for family and domestic violence would only be relevant to the type of employment condition that you were engaged on—that is, being on an award rather than those that perhaps were employed under collective bargaining. The principle shouldn't be different for anyone. The previous coalition government therefore legislated in late 2018. Equally, we had a decision of the Fair Work Commission in May of this year to extend that, to evolve that further, to bring in place now, instead of unpaid leave for five days, paid leave for 10 days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My understanding of the bill that the government has introduced will do much like what we did back in 2018 and take a Fair Work Commission decision and ensure that it applies to everyone, not just those that the Fair Work Commission is in a position to provide that entitlement to. When the bill comes before the House again, and once we've had the opportunity to do appropriate consultation and understand all the detail, I look forward to us engaging in that legislative reform. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this motion certainly gives us a chance to reinforce how significant and important it is to be discussing this issue. Although it is sometimes emotional and painful, because we're talking about people that are in a terrible circumstance in their domestic environment and we're talking about statistics that we want to change for the better, this is an area which does give us an opportunity to keep progressing the way in which we can support people that are in such a terrible circumstance to get out of that circumstance. It is in the broader area of financial support that we need to do more for victims in this area, because all of us as members of parliament have particular interactions with constituents who have been or are in a circumstance where they can't escape their situation for financial reasons. Providing people with the ability to take leave without a financial penalty on them or any other employment penalty because of the conditions that they're employed under, and correcting it for those that do not have this right, is a very important thing to do. It's one of many things that I'm sure we'll be looking to do into the future. This is a clear opportunity for us, and I look forward to seeing it become a reality very shortly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  On Thursday morning this week I joined a rally of extraordinary women who have been at the forefront of the advocacy for women's safety in this nation. We gathered to commemorate women who were killed through acts of family and domestic violence, and to acknowledge those still trapped in violent homes. We also marked our new Labor government's introduction of legislation that will give around 11 million workers including casuals access to 10 days paid domestic and family violence leave. This legislation will mean that survivors of domestic violence will no longer be forced into the hideous situation where they choose between losing their jobs or escaping violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Michele O'Neil, President of the ACTU, said at the rally 'this isn't something that began yesterday; this is a decade of struggle', a decade of campaigning, workplace from workplace and indeed in this building. As I walked back to this place after that rally with my dear friend and colleague the member for Sydney, we reminisced about those very first meetings a decade ago we took with the ASU New South Wales secretary Natalie Lang and her extraordinarily courageous delegates who came to this House, along with researchers, who were able to prosecute for the case for this paid domestic violence leave and the impact this policy shift would have. While advocates faced constant opposition from the former coalition government at that time, I am so heartened that the Anthony Albanese Labor government introduced this bill in the very first week of this new parliament to make this issue front and centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Report after report have revealed the devastating and endemic nature of domestic violence. It is not an unfortunate circumstance; it is a national shame. Just last month a report from the Paul Ramsay Foundation authored by Anne Summers revealed that 60 per cent of single mothers have experienced domestic violence. The same report also set out the immense financial challenges women face when leaving violent homes. This reflects what I hear in my electorate of Newcastle from our women's groups and from those victims and survivors, like the single mother who shared her experience of surviving and escaping domestic violence. Along with many others over my time, she wanted to share her story with me to highlight just how incredibly difficult it is to navigate your way through this process, and economic security was absolutely crucial for her in order to keep herself and her kids safe. She had used all of her personal and annual leave. She found it almost impossible to get to all of the appointments she needed to try and sort out housing, to get her kids into new schools. The perpetrator of the violence kept following her around, so she had to continuously be on the move. She had appointments with the police, she had to access support, all of this while trying desperately not to lose her job and the economic security that was going to enable her to actually set up a new safe environment for her and her kids. She isn't alone, and this is a story that I and my office hear time and time again. That is why it is crucial Labor has introduced this bill to cover all workers. Women should not be disadvantaged simply because they are casual workers. We know that women are far more likely to be in casual work than men, and this leave will give all workers the time, the support and the job security that they need to escape and to rebuild their lives after an abusive relationship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mood amongst the rally last Thursday differed vastly to when I was on those same lawns just last March with many of the same woman demanding justice and equality from the previous government. For starters, our new Prime Minister attended last week's rally. He addressed the vigil. He paid tribute to the women and the union movement behind this policy coming to reality. I thank him, as do all Australian women, for his leadership in this role. Getting out of a violent situation is always a hard thing to do but it is going to be less likely that you will be left jobless or without economic security due to the introduction of these laws into the Australian parliament.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  I rise to support the motion currently before this House, which notes the government's commitment to provide workers, including casual workers, with 10 days of paid leave to deal with the impacts of family and domestic violence. This parliament needs to move quickly to address the scourge that is domestic and family violence within our country. I've held women's roundtables and met with our local police, so I know it is also a scourge that affects my electorate of Hughes. To that end, I support this motion and I support the legislation. We need to acknowledge that the former coalition government, in December 2018, passed legislation that enshrined five days unpaid family and domestic violence leave into the Fair Work Act's National Employment Standards. This motion is supported, as it notes that this government is committed to providing many other Australian workers with 10 days paid leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the victims of domestic violence in our country are women, often women with children. It is almost impossible for women with children impacted by violence within their own home—they need some financial support at the beginning to be able to move out of the circle that is domestic violence. This legislation will support some of the victims to be able to start to make that move.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge that the coalition did, over a period of nine years, invest over $2 billion in women's safety, including a record $1.1 billion in the last budget to respond to violence against women. However, clearly there has not been enough done, and this legislation will assist some of the more vulnerable victims to be able to move out from a violent situation. This is said in a context where I've met with women's groups, local lawyers and local police. Women should not be penalised further financially, often with the threat of losing their job, because they are seeking to move themselves and/or their children away from a violent home life. The legislation referred to in this motion, the Fair Work Amendment (Paid Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2022, would see the entitlement enshrined in National Employment Standards, which cover up to 11 million employees. This is a good step forward and is based on the initial work done by the former coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a parliament, we need to demonstrate that we have zero tolerance for family violence and recognise that there is a need for specialised legal and other joined-up services for those dealing with family separation, divorce and family violence. Family separation and divorce are two of the most difficult events that people will encounter in their lives, and they're also a time when family violence can escalate and place victims at increased risk of harm. If we can provide those victims with an opportunity to take some paid leave at a time when it's desperately needed, this will be the first step for many of our victims to be able to move away from the scourge that is family and domestic violence within their own home. Women experiencing domestic violence should never have to choose between their safety and their wages. They'll often need assistance to make that first step to escape from that violence. I commend this motion, on the basis that the legislation it refers to will assist those victims.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  Two weeks ago a 30-year-old woman known as AK, and her 14-week-old baby, were found dead at a Central Australian outstation. A gun and the body of AK's partner were found nearby, and NT Police are investigating the murder-suicide. It was a devastating discovery for AK's family, her surviving children and our NT community. It's also devastating how little media attention the deaths have attracted. We as a nation haven't publicly grieved them the way we have grieved other victims, and that's worth reflecting on. Every woman's life and every child's life should be treated with value. Such deaths cannot continue to fly under the radar, and violence must be held to account. First Nations women in Australia experience some of the highest rates of violence of any population in the world. It accounts for three out of five calls NT police receive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this isn't an issue just to do with First Nations communities. Nationally, one woman dies every week or so at the hands of her former or current partner. We obviously need to do better. We must do better to protect women and children and to stop violence from occurring in the first place. I was proud to secure an election commitment of $3.2 million in funding for DV providers in my electorate, and I look forward to working with the NT government, Dawn House and the Darwin Aboriginal and Islander Women's Shelter, DAIWS, to deliver funding to provide more safe accommodation for women and children fleeing danger at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I met with a number of Darwin groups providing domestic and family violence support that are doing tremendous work under extremely difficult circumstances. They have told me repeatedly that the Territory is in dire need of needs based funding. Our violence prevention services cannot keep being funded on a per capita model when the rates of disadvantage, violence and abuse are so high. Our services are overstretched and underfunded. Only a needs based funding model will begin to tackle the crisis we have. I will continue to advocate for my friend and colleague Minister Rishworth to overhaul how funding for these services is allocated. I am proud to be part of a federal government that is committed to ending domestic and family violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A real impediment to women escaping is that they feel financially trapped, without the money to rent a house and get set up or meet their kids' needs. They should never have to choose between their safety and their wages. That's why this government is ensuring that workers can access 10 days of paid leave in order to deal with the impact that violence is having on them and their families. The coverage of casual workers is important, as women experiencing such violence are often employed casually. They need this certainty. This will be a lifeline for so many, and it is long overdue. The government will also release our national plan to end violence against and children in October.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is on all of us to confront and stamp out violence at every level. I commend the men in my electorate that are standing up against violence, including Charlie King and the Catholic education office in my electorate. Their message is simple: no more. I want to commend Charlie for something else, too—for pointing out that women do not have 'CU in the NT' stickers on their cars for a reason. That's because the slogan has a dark underbelly and is detested by many women. They know that for many they're the last words they hear before they are knocked unconscious or worse. No good man beats a woman. Not all family and domestic violence comes down to the man, but, for everyone, let's say, 'No more,' and work for a much safer community and country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's unemployment rate plummeted to 3.5 per cent last month. This is the lowest rate in 48 years and effectively full employment. This is a good thing, but it has created an increasingly tight labour market, with high demand for engaging and retaining workers, particularly in the regions. Consequently, it's become increasingly difficult for employers to find and attract staff. In my electorate I'm reminded of this on a daily basis—the need for workers to pick fruit, to package produce, to serve in retail and hospitality. Just on Saturday I was talking to a tyre business who are desperately looking for a mechanic and willing to pay double, and they have been looking for months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional communities are desperately looking for workers to function and, in many instances, to provide for the supply of food that we all enjoy. While our local communities struggle with the lost economic opportunity, a solution to the workforce problem sits idle in anticipation right before us. The solution is our older Australians. Australia has one of the lowest workforce participation rates for people aged 65 years and older. It is currently 14.2 per cent. This compares with the OECD average of 15.3 per cent; Sweden, 19 per cent; the United States, 19.4 per cent; and in our New Zealand neighbour, 24.8 per cent. Workforce participation among pensioners with limited savings is even lower, at just three per cent. The data and the anecdotal evidence strongly suggest there is an underutilised workforce available to us. However, older Australians are prematurely leaving critical sectors such as aged care and other allied health sectors because of the penalty associated with working and the consequential reduction in pension entitlements. The anxiety and stress of dealing with Centrelink every fortnight is precluding people from continuing on in the workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there were 107,700 people aged 60 to 69 who are no longer in the labour force, not retired and not currently employed but wanting to work part time or perhaps even close to full time. National Seniors Australia found in their recent survey that one in five pensioners would consider re-entering the workforce, and this was prior to the latest inflation and cost-of-living increases. Many older Australians want to work. Our businesses, our regions and our critical sectors want older Australians to work. What we need now is a government that also wants older Australians to be given the opportunity to work. This would help to address our workforce shortages, would see an increase in tax paid and would encourage the transfer of workforce skills from older Australians to younger Australians. I am calling on the government to do its bit to make the necessary changes to allow older Australians to participate in the workforce without penalty of losing their pension, and specifically to provide an opt-in scheme to increase the income threshold for pensioners with limited savings, as an incentive to engage and reengage people into paid work. Such a scheme would be voluntary and, importantly for government, would increase tax revenue and positively contribute to our GDP. The extra tax revenue could be used to help fund core needs such as aged care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This place rarely gets the opportunity to debate and review policy initiatives that have support across a broad spectrum of representative bodies, and this policy has support. National Seniors Australia has championed this policy. The National Farmers Federation, the Business Council of Australia, the council of business organisations Australia, often known as COSBOA, support this policy. Dairy farmers support this policy. This is desperately needed. Family businesses, from small family businesses to large businesses, support this policy, and our most critical sectors such as health and agriculture desperately need this policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the government just to trial this initiative, even if you just trial it in our regions. It just makes good sense, and I think that there would be broad support across this parliament to help older Australians to access employment, for those who want to do it, without having to deal with Centrelink every fortnight and without losing 50c in the dollar for working hard for Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  After a decade of inaction by the Morrison, Turnbull and Abbott governments we have seen a shocking skills shortage crisis in regional Australia. I see it every day on display in my electorate in South-East Queensland. When you cut $3 billion from TAFE, training and skills, this will have a consequence, and the impact will be worse in regional Australia. I thank the member for Mayo for moving this motion, because she would see this issue in her electorate, and I certainly see it in the country towns in the electorate I represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economy is being held back by the failure of the previous government. The lack of policy, leadership and planning for the past 10 years has been astonishing. We have a lack of skilled workers in regional areas. I see it, for example, in areas such as the meat industry in my electorate. I have JBS, Dinmore, Kilcoy Global Foods up in Kilcoy, and Greenmountain in Coominya. We see, all the time, skilled jobs that people want to engage in, so we need to take steps and we need to take action as quickly as we possibly can. That is why the Albanese Labor government's commitment to 465,00 fee-free places at TAFE and 20,000 additional university places is so critical. I commend the government for putting the Jobs and Skills Summit and Jobs and Skills Australia high on our agenda, as they will be absolutely crucial. Indeed, in my electorate we're having a jobs and skills summit as well in Ipswich, and I encourage people in the chamber of commerce, in the charitable sector and in other sectors, including in the faith based sector, to engage in this process as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we see a lot of discrimination, particularly in regional Australia, of people with disability, of First Nations people and of people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. There are great barriers to labour participation in regional areas and it is made worse by discrimination against so many Australians from backgrounds where they are disadvantaged. The reality is that, to get rid of these barriers of discrimination against older Australians and people from these types of backgrounds, business, government and unions have an important role to play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arrangements to support older Australians are really critical. I note the motion calls for an opt-in scheme to increase income test thresholds for pensioners with limited savings as an incentive to engage in paid work. It is interesting that so far only three per cent of pensioners are actually taking up the advantage of the current work bonus concession. There is capacity for pensioners working in my electorate and elsewhere. I see the opposition are calling for the work bonus for pensioners to be doubled, despite the fact the coalition did nothing about it during the nine long years they had in office. Again and again, we saw bills before this chamber where the coalition wanted to keep older Australians working longer. For example, they spent five years trying to raise the pension age to 70. The opposition should know that people who work in certain industries and certain trades find it particularly hard—for example, if they are working in the police or the military. They have high levels of work related injuries, can't work for longer periods and have to retire earlier. We see this all the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge that recent increases in inflation and the cost of living are huge issues for older Australians, so we need to do more and do better, and that is why Labor's Jobs and Skills Summit and Jobs and Skills Australia are critical for identifying areas where there are shortages and for removing the barriers to older Australians, young people and people in migrant communities. These things are really important, and we need to take steps to do them. I understand the sentiment from the member from Mayo. I understand where she's coming from, and this government is committed to removing those barriers. People living in regional Australia have worse health outcomes, have fewer job opportunities and struggle with challenges that people who live in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane do not know and do not experience. So we need to do all that we can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first actions of this particular government, which I commend, is allowing older Australians and people in regional communities to manage their money. That's why we're moving to abolish the Morrison government's privatised cashless debit card. It's really critical for regional Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I thank the member for Mayo for bringing forward this private member's motion and shining a light on what is a critically important issue to regional and rural Australia. I would suggest that my seat of O'Connor, stretching across 1.1 million square kilometres, is probably as badly affected by this current labour shortage as any electorate across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The regional city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, part of the Goldfields mining industry, has been the canary in the coalmine, because we've seen unemployment rates in Kalgoorlie-Boulder sub three per cent for over five years now. So we've experienced this current skills shortage that the rest of Australia has been experiencing now for many years. I'm very proud of some of the measures that the previous government put in place, and skilled migration has been a big part of that. Unfortunately, with the COVID restrictions and border closures—many of which were necessary—some closures, particularly in the western part of the continent, were perhaps a little bit over the top.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have seen a rapid drying up of that skilled migration program. It is starting to be accessed again, but I'd like to make the comment that the time to process these applications is taking a minimum of 12 months and an average of 18 months. The cost to businesses sponsoring skilled migrants can be up to $20,000, with no guarantee of an outcome. This is a big issue for the businesses across my electorate, particularly in the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder. As the member for Blair mentioned, abattoirs—meat works—are finding it very hard to find staff. I've got several large operations across my electorate, and they are accessing the expanded Pacific Islander scheme, and that's another initiative of the Morrison government which is paying dividends. We certainly need to upskill our local workers and encourage people to move to and have a wonderful lifestyle in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving on to the substance of the motion, and that is getting our pensioners, who are willing and able, to work. There are many who don't want to work full time, but they would be quite happy to contribute by doing a day or two here and there. The coalition has announced a policy, which I'm very, very supportive of, that we will double the Age and Veteran Service Pension Work Bonus Scheme, from $300 per fortnight to $600 per fortnight. The practical implication here is that a couple, who might want to hook the caravan up and head out to the Wheatbelt, in my electorate, and maybe help out through the harvest period, would be able to earn up to $1,200 per fortnight, without impacting their pension. I think that's a great incentive. A month working on a chaser bin is not physically demanding. You sit in an air-conditioned cab. It takes a bit of skill and a bit of training, but I'm sure many of the older people that I know would certainly be able to pick up that sort of job in no time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very supportive of the scheme. I see it as a great initiative to help regional Australia find the casual workers that we lost when we lost our backpackers, and, once again, that goes back to the COVID border closures. But backpackers do suit some of the work tasks in regional Australia particularly well. It's seasonal work; it might be a month or two. It doesn't suit Australian people to leave the metropolitan area to go to, for example, Manjimup, in the Southern Forests to pick apples for a couple of months. It's not something that rational people would do, but for a backpacker who's travelling around Australia, it's ideal work. Unfortunately we've lost them; they don't seem to have the confidence yet to start travelling again, particularly in Western Australia. But a pensioner and his or her partner may decide that going down to the beautiful Southern Forests for a month or two with the caravan, or to stay in a donga on a property, and help out with the apple picking, would be very much something that would suit their lifestyle and would suit them financially. Then they could continue on for a few months on their merry way with the caravan and enjoy their holiday. I absolutely support and commend this policy initiative from the coalition and I thank the member for Mayo once again for raising this issue in parliament.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  I thank the member for Mayo for bringing this motion, because we absolutely do need to consider all possibilities to boost workforce participation with people who are willing and able to work. It is a time at the moment where many employers in my community and in other communities are reporting that they're struggling to get the workers that they need. That's why it is really important that our government will hold our Jobs and Skills Summit in September, bringing together groups like unions, employers, civil society and governments so that we can collectively address this challenge that's before us and consider different options like this one that's been brought by the member for Mayo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at our pensions and our social security system, one of the central parts of the Australian social security system is our strong and targeted pension system. It's important to note that it is a targeted system; it measures a person's need for income support and their capacity to contribute towards their own support through the means test. The targeted nature of our system is a large part of what makes it equitable, and that should be a principle we retain as we do consider further changes. This is a government that will always stand up for pensioners. We know that the Australians who've worked hard all their lives, who have built this country, need support and respect based on that. That's an abiding principle for this government as we look at this. That includes the ability to work if they want to do so. The current pension work test does allow for pensioners to work, and these arrangements are generous. But the data shows us that, as at March 2022, only three per cent of aged pensioners were taking advantage of the current work bonus concession. In fact the number of aged pensioners with employment earnings has been declining over time, despite there being previous increases in the value of the concessions—so there have been some incentives put in place. So far what we haven't seen is people taking that up and actually working, so we need to consider what other factors may be behind older Australians not choosing to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that one of these factors is most likely age discrimination and the reluctance of many employers to hire older workers. I know in my electorate, I hear from a lot of older people, particularly older women, who might have been out of the workforce for some time and who are looking to re-enter, about the real age discrimination they face. They just can't actually get a job interview. From people who have been laid off later in life, I hear the same problem. Employers just knock back their CV once they see how old they are. Age discrimination is one of the factors that Ian Yates, the Chief Executive Officer of the Council of the Ageing Australia has cited as a factor in older people not being in jobs, even if they do want to work. In fact, he has cited figures from the Australian Human Rights Commission that somewhere between a quarter and a third of employers actively discriminate on age. This is something that, as a society and as a government, we absolutely have to consider. I was really heartened to see the Minister for Skills and Training in the media today talking about just this—about the fact that age discrimination does exist when it comes to older people working, and that that's something that we have to tackle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other factors that I think we also need to consider when we look at this issue are things like low wages. The member for Mayo talked about the aged-care sector, an area where we know that so many centres are crying out for workers. But let's be honest; the current wage in aged care is not very attractive. Again, if you're a pensioner, if you're looking at re-entering the workforce, one of the things you have to weigh up is, 'Well, is it worth my time?' I think a lot of pensioners are probably currently looking at the aged-care sector and thinking, 'On that rate, that is a pretty unattractive proposition.' Our government has made a commitment to look at low-paid work to support an increase for aged-care workers. We know that this is vitally important work and that our aged-care workers deserve a pay rise. Perhaps that's something that will make it a sector that is more attractive to older people. Again, this is an idea worth considering and it is great that our job summit will give us the opportunity to do just that as well as look more broadly at how we are encouraging people to be part of our system to work and to have the fulfilment and the income that comes from working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at all factors, such as age discrimination and low wages in industries like aged care and others. Most importantly, we must retain our respect for pensioners. We must make sure that we always stand up for pensioners and their right to a decent life.</span>

Certainly I would have to say in the last six or 12 months as I've travelled around my electorate the No. 1 issue when I walk into a business has been, 'We can't get enough workers.' It's repeated whether it's in hospitality, the aged-care sector, agriculture, aquaculture, mining or local mechanic shops—it's right across the board—'We can't get enough workers.' While I know the issue is similar in the cities, I don't think it's to the same extent as it is in regional areas, because we know that we are always struggling to attract people to come and live in regional areas, which I find fairly insulting. It upsets me, but I can't do all that much about it, I have to say.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The suggestion that age pensioners and disability pensioners should be allowed to earn more before they hit the threshold where their pension starts to reduce, I think, is a very solid one. It's one that has been backed by Peter Dutton, the Leader of the Opposition, calling for a doubling. I think we are sitting at rates of $336 a fortnight at the moment for pensioner couples and $190 for singles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a plethora of schemes in place to assist people into the workforce. I have a printed list here. There are over 50 different schemes in place to assist people into the workforce—from relocation to re-education and a whole host of things. I'm not saying any of those programs are particularly failing, even though I don't think it hurts to ask the question of whether they are succeeding. But there is a reality in this debate at the moment—the fact that we have hit 3.5 per cent unemployment across Australia. If anyone is being brutally honest, that last three per cent is going to be fairly difficult to get into the workforce for a lot of reasons. I won't go down that pathway at the moment, but the point is, while these assistance schemes all sit there ready to help and helping where they can, that the last three or 3.5 per cent to go into the workforce will be people who don't want to shift, people who have poor skills, poor education, poor health and a whole host of other reasons. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners are the perfect group to be targeting. I will just make the point that there is not a retirement age in Australia. There is no retirement age. What there is is an eligibility for the age pension, which is at the age of 67 at the moment. So no-one should feel as they approach 67—and I am not all that far away from it, I must say—that they need to get out of the workforce. In fact, I say to many people, 'Consider what it's going to be like doing nothing for maybe the next 40 years, because the medical health system's pretty good.' How long one's piece of string is comes into contention when one is considering retirement. There are a lot of jobs where you can back off and become partially employed, but there are a lot of jobs where you can't. I might point out that being a federal politician is probably one of them. I really encourage people to keep some kind of work measure in their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While some people at that age of 67, to be brutal, are pretty clapped out, there are a lot who are not. I have a friend who has started up a gardening service. I think he's 68. He's one of the most energetic people you are likely to meet. He doesn't really want to work for half rates. He says to me: 'Can't you lift the threshold? Can't you do something about it, particularly at this time when Australia is so desperately short of workers?' Well, I couldn't agree with him more. Well done, Cliff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do back this call from the member for Mayo and I do back the call from Peter Dutton, the Leader of the Opposition, to lift that threshold. The sooner the better. I know it comes at a cost. The Treasurer at the moment is talking about the threats to the budget. I understand that. I can also say that not filling those jobs across Australia at the moment comes at a far greater cost than the $160 million that is mentioned in the documentation I have here. Not being able to fill jobs, businesses not being able to expand when there are opportunities in the market, not being able to replace people who are wanting to retire for good reason, and not being able to replace businesses that have bad effects from COVID at the moment are really costing the community dearly. We should get on with the job.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  I thank the member for Mayo for bringing this motion forward. Without doubt, the dynamic of Australia's workforce over the last few years has changed. The pandemic impacted on businesses worldwide, and globally we all adapted and accepted change. We saw a record number of Australians working or studying from home, adapting work schedules to stay safe and still be productive. They tried to juggle a work-lifestyle balance. We experienced all the positives and all the negatives that resulted from the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very likely that many Australians would be able to clearly state that their way of work and their dynamic of work have changed over the past few years. I know many members of my community, in my home electorate of Pearce in Western Australia, have continued to maintain a flexible work schedule and still work from home on designated days whilst travelling to work on other days. This is not uncommon for many people across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that our workforce has the power to adapt and change, as it has over the last few years. We know that the Australian workforce is constantly changing, including people retiring and people entering employment for the very first time. The government is always ready to listen and consider initiatives to aid the Australian workforce in whatever capacity necessary. This will include consideration of ideas to boost workforce participation or ideas to boost labour supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many people in Pearce will know, my main priority on becoming a member is to bring a voice to Canberra, but I can only be the voice of my electorate of Pearce if I listen to what our community is telling me. We have a fabulous community of seniors—over 55s—in my electorate. I visit them as often as I can and I listen to what they have to say. We have many seniors groups, including the Groovy Grannies, the Knit and Natters, the Growing Old Living Dangerously, the Kookaburra Ladies and many more who volunteer thousands of hours of their time. Seniors forums have been organised to provide an opportunity for people to have their say. With repetition for emphasis: there is one very clear message that comes through for people over 55 who have retired and have the capacity, skill, experience and willingness to work—the barriers to entry into the workforce are too high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to many pensioners who are experiencing these issues. While existing arrangements do allow pensioners to work, only three per cent of aged pensioners are taking advantage of the current work bonus concession—that is, only 75,706 people out of 2.6 million. Like in my colleague's electorate of Jagajaga, the number of aged pensioners with employment earnings has been declining over time, despite previous increases in the value of the concession. The Leader of the Opposition recently said that the work bonus for pensioners should be doubled. However, the previous government elected not to do this during the decade they had in office, to the disappointment of many within my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The age pension income test is designed to provide work incentives for pensioners who choose to do so. We also know that many people who are on the age pension prefer not to work and are often kept busy in other activities or helping out with their grandchildren. For those who want to continue working or whose planned circumstances have changed, the incentives are there through the income-free area and the work bonus. However, many pensioners over 55 who have retired have advised that they would enjoy, and require, working more hours but the negative impact on their own pension and their partner's pension discourages them from doing so. The government is listening and is holding a jobs and skills summit in September to hear from Australians right across the country about the barriers that they face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People should have every opportunity to work if they wish to. This includes people with a disability, people managing health conditions, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, First Nations people and, of course, those over the age of 55. The summit will hear from Australians experiencing barriers, and we will listen to ideas about how we can do better and dismantle those barriers. The summit will be followed by a government white paper on employment— </span>

                  <a href="290544" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  In 2022 the Australian people showed us the way. Self-interest is out and the national interest is in, but it's planetary and interspecies interests that are trending. Our First Nations people have known this for eons. I am looking forward to enshrining their voice in our constitution and embedding their wisdom into our ways. I am honoured to stand on the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people and I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am the unlikeliest of politicians: no political experience in the conventional sense, no history with the Labor Party and no political pedigree. People ask: 'How did this happen? How did you make history? How did lifelong conservatives vote Labor?' In no other country nor electorate would my story even be possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the pandemic that led to my political awakening. In the first half of 2020 I stopped sleeping as I watched healthcare workers in Italy die. Hospitals resembled war zones. Patients lined corridors. Death was everywhere. At my hospital, colleagues in hushed tones disclosed to me concerns about their safety at work. They felt powerless against a medical establishment that steadfastly held that COVID was spread by droplets and surgical masks were fine. At that time vaccines were a pipedream and we were going into battle with sticks rather than lightsabres. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had to act. I tried corridor diplomacy, but hit brick walls. Aerosol scientists were shouting from the rooftops that COVID was airborne, floating in the air like smoke, slipping through the gaps in our masks and around the perspex screens that had sprung up like weeds. At the time, I would have been safer cracking rocks underground than working on a hospital ward. Miners had access to the best respiratory equipment, like machines that kept deadly particles out of their lungs, and they had the licence of their CEO and board, who were liable if things went wrong. It's a credit to our mining industry and unions that they have these standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, nurses and doctors were having the right masks ripped out of their hands due to PPE shortages. Staff infections spread to the community, triggering an extension of lockdowns while we waited for the vaccines to arrive. And we waited—while people got sick or got sick of lockdowns. It was cold comfort to my doctor husband and me that we had sorted out our wills. At least my children would be fine if their parents died. As it transpired, the cure for my insomnia was activism. Speaking truth to power brought a psychic peace. It was my political awakening that helped me sleep. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With like-minded colleagues, I co-founded Health Care Workers Australia and advocated for better: for masks that fit your face; for transparent reporting of healthcare worker infections, because you can't improve what you can't measure; for recognition that COVID is spread through the air; and for better national guidelines, because they determine our safety in hospitals, aged care, schools and businesses. I urged the then government to broaden our limited vaccine repertoire, because I could see variants coming. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my proudest works was the first Australian study documenting the experiences of healthcare workers. 'Hearing the voices of Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic' says it all. Their stories were the reason for the season. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I've learnt, I now bring to parliament—that is, the need to listen to the front line. Whether it's health care, business or the environment, those at the coalface know the problems and will proffer solutions before they become crises. That is the wisdom of the edge. National leadership that prioritises work health and safety is essential. Healthy, happy workers make the economy hum, especially in mission-critical industries like health care, aged care, education or business. This much we owe to our nurses, doctors, allied health professionals, paramedics, support staff and educators, whose deep wells of altruism are nearly dry. A future CDC must prioritise the welfare of our first responders, because there is no pandemic response without them. Today I pay tribute to my friend Millie, a nurse, and my friends Marco and Sarah, doctors, who are in the gallery. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Watch out for the tail. It has a sting. For COVID, it will be chronic disease and mass illness disrupting lives and constraining our productivity for years to come. This is not inevitable but depends on what we do next. Cleaning the air is one important but neglected lever that will help apply downward pressure. National guidelines on ventilation will empower our people and businesses to stay safe and live more freely. It will spawn a new industry in air safety, making us more resilient against respiratory viruses and a future disease X. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Diversity is the antidote to groupthink, so welcome those contrarian voices. The discomfort leaders like us feel when hearing what we don't like from people with skin in the game is usually a good thing. They are often the truth-tellers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, be aware that the four most dangerous words in science are, 'there is no evidence'. These four words have shut the gate on life- and economy-saving measures. When there is no evidence, then default to common sense and err on the side of caution until daylight emerges. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After experiencing the powerlessness of not being listened to, I understand the profound power of being heard. It's a lesson I carried with me to the streets and the homes of Higgins. I had thousands of conversations, walking up and down our electorate in my gold runners. It was a real grassroots campaign, powered by the greatest force for good—people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Higgins is 39 square kilometres—a little bit smaller than Lingiari—and encompasses South Yarra with its famous Chapel Street, the iconic Prahran market, the stately homes of Toorak, the leafy streets of Malvern and Armadale with their vibrant small businesses, south to the multicultural foodie hub of Koornang Road, Carnegie, bordered by the wide, quiet streets of Murumbeena, Glen Iris and Ashburton. Dog walkers abound, parents grab coffees between pick-ups, young people jog the streets, schoolkids jumble into trams. Since its inception in 1949, Higgins has been a Liberal stronghold, until now. It has produced two prime ministers, Gorton and Holt, or four if you include Menzies and Fraser, who lived there. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the former member for Higgins Dr Katie Allen for her contribution to public life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Higgins is a high-performance electorate where people are self-made or well on the way but disadvantage hides in plain sight. I observed too many young adults in full-time work still tethered to their parents, unable to buy a home. I met a young mum unable to return to full-time work because she could not afford $200 a day on child care. Marion, an educator who had been on a casual contract for over a decade, was now facing the prospect of losing her home because her hours had been cut. A small-business owner cried every night because she is exhausted by the pressures of the past two years. And I lost count of the number of male retirees, and they were always men, who demanded I tax them more because they were appalled at the level of inequality in our society and didn't need the 'welfare'—their words, not mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People from every background and belief were inspired to make a change at that election because they understood what it meant for our nation. It is an electorate beating with a lion heart. Dr Ennis, an endocrinologist and Higgins resident of 50 years, sums it up. As a child he asked his father who he should vote for. His father replied: 'Families like ours always do well when the Liberal Party are in government but sometimes you have to do what is best for everyone and what is best for the community. That's why I always vote Labor.' Three days after Dr Ennis died, Higgins returned its first Labor member. Dr Ennis did his bit; now I will do mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Higgins will judge us by the force of our actions rather than the froth of our words, as Churchill said. But listening to locals, hearing their stories on front steps and on the end of the phone became for me the reason for the season. To the people of Higgins: I carry with me your wishes and your worries into government. It is a humbling and heavy responsibility, and I thank you for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could not have climbed this mountain without the support of my incredible volunteer army, the Labor branches who came and gave; my friend the member for Macnamara, who reached out and mentored me; my campaign team, Michael, Josh and Jet; all of my Labor colleagues here, including the frontbench, pretty much the whole frontbench; and the Prime Minister. I thank them for their generous support. Prime Minister, your calm, considered approach imbued with wisdom and kindness is just the medicine our country needs. To my husband: you are a tower of strength. To my teenagers Annika and Ash: you are far more accomplished than I was at your age. Look outwards always and make a positive contribution to this world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is bittersweet because not everyone could make it. My sister is caring for a child with COVID and my brilliant colleague Nada is laid low with long COVID after two bouts of illness, but she is watching. Such is the pandemic's long-reaching shadow. But we can and must push back against this shadow because our party, after all, is the light on this hill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing is built without a foundation, and mine was laid by my parents, Robert and Vimala. My father came from a village in northern Sri Lanka. He's the middle of seven children to a single mother, having lost his own father when he was 12. That he rose to become an accountant and small-business owner raising three professional children is nothing short of a miracle. My mother juggled full-time work and running a home, turning out delicious meals to the strains of Elvis and ABBA. As Tamils, my parents left Sri Lanka in the 1960s due to ethnic tensions. I was born in the UK then moved to Zambia, where I lived for 12 years before coming to Australia on the skilled migration program in 1984 when I was 11. In Zambia, I went on safari in the way my kids go to the beach: gripping on for dear life in the back of a Land Rover, awestruck as a little kid in front of Victoria Falls—a torrent of water known as Mosi-oa-Tunya, 'the smoke that thunders'. But it was Australia that made me an infectious diseases and general medicine physician, an academic, activist and now a parliamentarian. What a country! My story is one of intergenerational upward mobility, where education and hard work bent the arc of our lives. But that wasn't all. A person like me, who has experienced more headwinds than tailwinds, benefited from the Hawke and Keating economic legacy, a Catholic education and a cohesive society that welcomed a stranger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a lexicon for economic progress, ranging from GDP to unemployment figures, but we lack the language for social cohesion. And yet it is like money in the bank: social capital put away in good times to be drawn down in bad. As a migrant, I have watched with alarm as words used in this chamber ricochet around the country, tearing at our social fabric. Spillover effects are acts of hate on our streets against Asians, Jews, Muslims, people of colour, the gender diverse. And the gun gets fired here. We have a choice. We can accept the politics of division or devalue that currency to junk. I am proud that the Australian people and the people of Higgins did just that. 'Do better,' they cried. The triumph of modern Australia—a diverse multicultural nation—is worth celebrating every single day. Social capital is our true sovereign wealth fund that, if managed well, will pay a dividend to us, its shareholders, forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing in this chamber, I still feel the pull of medicine: a rewarding career of service and advocacy that will be extended here. I saw, for 25 years, the sins of society wash up in our public hospital system: homelessness, poor education, childhood trauma, social isolation, poverty, racism, unemployment and climate change. According to the WHO, these so-called social determinants of health can account for over half of all health outcomes, where one problem reinforces another. Health is all about context. For example, diabetes clusters with poor nutrition and poverty. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lancet</span> describes syndemics, the synergistic interaction of social, economic and environmental factors. It's a framework relevant to our future CDC but just as pertinent to this place too. I prescribe pills for problems rooted in disadvantage, but these are problems that need a parliament, not a prescription pad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a doctor, I saw things as they were. Now, as a parliamentarian, I see things as they could be. The venerated fair go, much like our safety at work, does not happen by luck. Barriers must be identified and dismantled, like inequality and unconscious bias so that, as Kennedy said, man has the freedom to grow to his full stature. Structural reforms must be introduced and embedded until they become part of the furniture, like Labor's Medicare. For women, the motherhood penalty clips our wings just as we unfurl them after years of slog and study. In the blur of home and work, years slip by, and ambition is dimmed until it snuffs out altogether. That double shift nearly broke me, which is why I am delighted that child care has been elevated in the economic agenda. With mountains of work to do, who can afford to leave the talent of women on the table? It makes me proud that the Labor caucus is now 52 per cent women—and they are fierce. And 50 per cent of our new Labor members are from culturally diverse backgrounds, including First Nations. It makes me even prouder that Higgins had something to do with this high watermark.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the seams of the bedrock of our ancient land, like precious ores, lie new ways of thinking. The One Health model encompassing human, animal and environmental health immediately elevates stewardship. Our First Nations have known this all along. We cannot privilege one above the other, because we are nourished both physically and spiritually by the natural world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is the threat multiplier, adding pressure to every system and every sector in society, but its effects will be unequally felt, so ironing out inequality now is a matter of urgency. Obama said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are the first generation to feel the effect of climate change and the last generation who can do something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our journey to a low-emissions future will be contingent on taking our coal and gas communities along. We owe them much, and we are, after all, the party of the Hunter and Higgins—a broad church indeed! A land crisscrossed by zero emission high-speed rail will bring our regions closer to us and us to them, triggering a regional boom. On intergenerational justice, the cries are only getting louder. An affordable home backed by secure work is like the warmth of a million suns. It should be the norm, not the exception.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Innovation will be key to solving many of these challenges. For that, we must again embrace the power of listening. As a nation we produce excellent research but need to do better at commercialising it. Our PhDs want to be CEOs of their own start-ups. I was a Research Australia finalist last year for my work on artificial intelligence but had been underfunded for years. It shouldn't be this hard. Unless things change, and fast, we will continue to lose our best young minds in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hunger Games</span> of funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Higgins I met John, a postdoc who was taking up a biomedical fellowship in the US because he felt like Australia had given up on him. To get great research into the market requires the science of implementation, but implementation science withers on the vine if we devalue the humanities, our creatives and social sciences. There is a big difference between inventing vaccines in the lab and getting them into arms—one is a science, the other an art. Different but complementary skills are needed, so let's usher in a flourishing of enterprise, embracing the diversity that makes us stronger than the sum of our parts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is said that the people perish when there is no vision. Mine is for an inclusive, sustainable and competitive Australia. As a nation, we have an embarrassment of riches, hearts bursting with aspirations, bodies alive with animal spirits and brains fizzing with ideas. Our task as leaders is to listen to our front line and knock down their barriers, reject short-termism in favour of generational investment—raising, not dimming, ambition so that our people take flight and soar. Because only by unifying, empowering and electrifying our people can we reach that cleaner, greener, fairer future. I thank the House.</span>

                  <a href="288713" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I'd like to begin this address by reading out the names of four people who grew up in regional Australia. They are four people who by virtue of when and where they were born had limited opportunities, but they used what opportunities there were to create a significant legacy for those who followed. The regional Australians I want to mention are Richard and Eileen Birrell and Ray and Molly Dunham. They have passed. I'm sure they never would have thought that they'd be spoken about in this chamber, but their lives and their ethics tell us an important story. They were my grandparents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were born in regional Australia just after the end of the First World War and, as a result, their early teenage years coincided with the ravages of the Great Depression. They had little opportunity for formal education, as they had to leave school at a young age to support their families. Their work was tough, but work did at least exist, due to the developing agricultural and food-processing industries in the regions. They then experienced the danger and deprivation of the Second World War and, after that, started families. They were determined to work as hard as they could to ensure that their children had a chance at educational opportunities that they never had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My parents, Brian and Sue, both from different parts of regional Victoria, met at Melbourne University, and after their studies came to the Goulburn Valley, as the prosperity of this region offered opportunities—my father in law and my mother as a teacher. I was, therefore, lucky enough to be born into this amazing part of regional Australia. I spent my childhood growing up on the banks of the Goulburn River, or the Kaiela, as it's called in Yorta Yorta language. I have three younger sisters: Emily, Sarah and Hannah. We remain close as adults. Our family life was always one where questions were encouraged, intellectual curiosity was ubiquitous and the overwhelming ethic was that people were to be cared for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After formative years at school in Shepparton and then as a boarder at Assumption College in Kilmore, I was looking for opportunities, but, as a disorganised and unstructured young man, this took a little while. But in the regions the community has your back. I found work on a fruit and cattle farm in Ardmona, just near the city of Shepparton. I recall with great appreciation the support my mother, Sue, gave me at this time in my life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I love agriculture. I was proud of what I was doing, helping to grow healthy food for people. I wanted to do more in this industry, but I knew that I had to gain further education. We know moving to the city, for young regional people, is tough and expensive, and often, to the detriment of regional communities, it also means they and their new-found skills are lost to the big smoke. But, to my great fortune, the University of Melbourne agricultural campus is in a place called Dookie, only 30 kilometres outside of Shepparton, and I was able to complete an agricultural science degree in my own region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I worked in agriculture in the Goulburn Valley, as an agronomist, advising farmers on aspects of crop production, and I then worked for Israeli irrigation pioneers Netafim, helping farmers around Australia and New Zealand use technology to apply water more efficiently to farms. At this time, I had the opportunity to be involved in the vibrant sports and arts communities in Shepparton. Music is the art form that sustains me, and my guitar will be a constant companion with me here in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the opportunity to further my education again by studying a Master of Business Administration degree at the Shepparton campus of La Trobe University. The MBA offered invaluable insights into dealing with complex problems such as the relationship between people and the economy. In my view, an economy is there to serve people, and people will contribute successfully to businesses and the economy if they are made to feel valued and if they are able to use their own creativity to improve the performance of those businesses and that economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had these opportunities for tertiary education in my region because La Trobe and Melbourne universities are committed to operating there, not just in capital cities. I want governments to continue supporting institutions who do this, because doing that is not just saying your postcode should not define your access to education; it is actually doing something to ensure it, and the Nationals have lived up to that in my region in recent times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the past six years, I've had the opportunity to serve my community as the CEO of the Committee for Greater Shepparton, an advocacy group funded and driven by the business community. In that capacity, I was able to gain knowledge of the issues facing many parts of our community, and I come to this place with that knowledge, in a spirit of collaboration, to find solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate I represent covers some of the southernmost ranges of the Great Divide, in which are nestled the vibrant and burgeoning towns of Seymour and Broadford and the Puckapunyal Army base. This is Taungurung country. In the central part of the electorate are the alluvial flatlands that span either side of the Goulburn River as it flows through the towns of Nagambie, Murchison and Toolamba. The Goulburn then junctions with the Broken River in Shepparton. Across the north of the electorate are the Murray River towns of Yarrawonga, Cobram and Echuca and the agricultural centres of Kyabram, Rochester, Nathalia and Numurkah. The electorate is named after Sir Doug Nicholls, a Yorta Yorta man who grew up on the Cummeragunja mission, near Echuca. He was a sportsman, social worker, pastor, Governor of South Australia and respected elder in the community, and his is an inspirational example of service and leadership.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The region is many things: home to a vibrant, sophisticated and evolving Indigenous culture; a critical food bowl of Australia, enabled by the Murray and Goulburn rivers, which supply a network of irrigation channels gravity-feeding water to farmland with highly fertile soils; and a major producer of apples, pears and peaches. It is a large producer of milk and a processor of this milk into high-quality dairy products that make their way around Australia and the world. If you are having a pizza somewhere in Australia or Asia, there is a good chance that the mozzarella cheese on it came from the Goulburn Valley.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the electorate of Nicholls is, I believe, one of the most successful examples of multiculturalism in the world. People from all over have made their way to this region, often coming with nothing, and they have made extraordinary lives. My observation as a member of this community is that we seem to do better when we celebrate each other's different cultural identity but moreover embrace each other's humanity, the humanity being a stronger bond between us than any divisions that tend to be amplified by race, gender, sexual orientation or religious view. As the Pink Floyd song 'Echoes' says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You will have noted the keyword I've used in this address is 'opportunity'. It was afforded to my grandparents thanks to regional industries, although in difficult circumstances. It was afforded to my parents in their access to tertiary education, which was only made possible because of the hard work and financial sacrifices of their parents. It has been afforded to me through a loving family with a focus on education, mentoring from my community, access to tertiary educational opportunities in my region and the vibrant industry that sustains us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am here because we need that opportunity to continue to be afforded to the people in regional Australia, the people of my electorate. How can we do this? Firstly, and most importantly, the opportunity to work in agriculture and food processing in my patch comes through reliable and affordable water for irrigation. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has taken a significant amount of that water away from productive use in my electorate. The water is now owned by the Commonwealth to be used for the environment. I know it has caused a lot of pain. We understand the need to look after the river system, and strategic and efficient use of environmental water can help us do that. But we are at a tipping point and no more can be taken from communities that have already done much of the heavy lifting. When water leaves an area, so does the economy that that water creates. If a farmer sells a water licence back to the government, the farmer may well be compensated, but the milk or fruit that the farmer once grew grows no longer. The people in the supply chain that got the product to the consumer are no longer employed. The community, the region and, indeed, Australia are poorer in so many ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, there was a political add-on to the original Murray-Darling Basin Plan that said that 450 extra gigalitres on top of what was already taken could be taken away from productive use and sent downstream. But there is an important caveat in the legislation. It says it can only be taken if it would have a neutral or improved socioeconomic impact on basin communities. If any of this water was to be removed from irrigation in our region, the impact on our communities would be overwhelmingly negative. That's a no-brainer. In addition, any attempt to push that much water downstream could erode the banks of our rivers and cause negative environmental impacts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some try to argue that socioeconomic neutrality relates to the farmer being significantly compensated, so they say, 'We will just go and buy the 450 gigalitres back.' But my father, who has spent his working life analysing the wording in legislation, has always taught me that words matter and that in legislation all words must do some work and carry some weight. The meaning and weight of the term 'socioeconomic' is undeniable. 'Socio' means society. 'Economic' means economy. If the society and the economy in our basin communities would be negatively affected—and they would be—then the socioeconomic neutrality test fails. So no part of this extra water, this 450 gigalitres, can be removed from productive irrigation. If we do not have productive industries, opportunity for future generations will evaporate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is a complex challenge for our country. The overwhelming scientific opinion is that greenhouse gas emissions are causing a changing climate and that to prevent an average temperature rise that would lead to real challenges for humanity we as a planet need to reduce our emissions. The need to act is not in question. How we do it, without causing huge economic damage to our nation and its people, is the question. It is the how, not the if. Done in a reckless manner, with unrealistic time lines out of step with our global competitors, we could face a situation where industry moves emissions overseas. Australia's economic strength would be reduced but global emissions would not. It's a reality we need to face. I'm sure that as a nation we are up to this challenge, and I look forward to working constructively towards a just transition and keeping our mind open to the range of technologies that can get us there. In my mind, just transition means that the justice, human rights and dignity of those most affected by any change need to be protected, and often these are people in regional areas. We need to safeguard their opportunity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I joined the National Party and asked the people of Nicholls to elect me as representative in this chamber because I believe in regional Australia and I want to see it thrive. Some of the great steps forward that we have made have been thanks to my predecessor, Damian Drum, as a member of the Nationals in government. We're on a better path than we once were. We have new cultural institutions, better transport, better tertiary education facilities and more opportunity for young people to have successful careers in our region, particularly in health care. That came from a real collaboration between Drummy and the community, along with the focus of the Nationals. I want to continue to develop our region and regional Australia more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want an Australia that's dominated by a few ever-expanding megacities. Let's look at the example of Germany. Germany has a population of 80 million, but its largest city has three million. Its structure is a network of vibrant smaller regional cities with strong industries linked by high-speed rail. Australia needs to approach this population balance question in a strategic way. I believe this happens by sustainably developing our regional cities, ensuring the towns that surround them are places that people want to move to, and creating the space and conditions for vibrant and profitable industries in the regions. We can link these places to capitals with high-speed electrified rail, and all of this can be powered by new technology with lower emissions. The spirit of these communities will be centred on creating opportunity for all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the volunteers who supported my campaign, especially the campaign committee, chaired by Lyndsay Dann. The only reason I'm in a position to do any of this work is because I married Lisa. Prior to meeting her, I was described as talented but wayward, a young man lacking in organisation, structure and direction. But thanks to Lisa's love, support and influence, I've been able to attain a position I could never have imagined. A lesson here is that all of us deserve the opportunity for love and partnership.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My kids, Sophie and David, continue to provide inspiration, and I hope I can make them proud in this job, as we work towards ensuring that their generations, and the ones that follow, have better opportunities than we had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing: Richard and Eileen and Ray and Molly were born about 100 years ago in regional Australia. What future are we setting up for those born in the regions now? We owe it to them to invest, to innovate, to work hard and smart, to ensure opportunity is there for all, as we adapt to a changing future. So thank you all for the opportunity.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  Deputy Speaker, parliamentary colleagues, friends, family and everyone who is here today, I would like to begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal and the Ngambri people, whose land we meet on today, and paying my respects to their elders, past, present and emerging. I would also like to acknowledge the Garigal people, as the traditional custodians of the lands of Mackellar, and thank them for protecting country and waters there since time immemorial. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand before you today as the Independent member for Mackellar. To be here as the elected representative of the community that I love is indeed a deep honour and a privilege. But I stand here not for myself, not for a party, but as a voice for you, the people of Mackellar. I am just the fifth person to represent Mackellar since the seat was first established in 1949. I'd like to thank my recent predecessors Mr Jason Falinski and the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop for their years of dedication and service to our community. You may not know much about Mackellar or our vibrant, diverse and hardworking community, but the 150,000 people that call Mackellar home know we live in a special place. From the beautiful coastline that sweeps south from Palm Beach to Dee Why, to the bushland that lies adjacent to Terrey Hills, Duffys Forest and Belrose, Mackellar is simply a stunning place. For thousands of years before us, Mackellar was home to the Garigal people, and throughout Mackellar you can still stumble upon the area's Indigenous history, through rock carvings, middens and paintings. Over 1,000 sites exist on the northern beaches today, an echo of a period long past but that must be remembered and honoured.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is not just the natural beauty or the proud Indigenous history that makes Mackellar a special place; it is the people and their spirit—the spirit of Mackellar. That spirit was embodied by our namesake, Dorothea Mackellar, whose beautiful poem, <span style="font-style:italic;">My Country</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>moves us still and whose daring and pioneering spirit led the way for women's rights. Mackellar is home to some of Australia's brightest entrepreneurs, hardworking families, a vibrant arts scene and incredible sporting talent. Mackellar is also diverse. Wonderfully, Mackellar has Australia's largest Tibetan community. It is this community spirit, the spirit of Mackellar, that rose during the election campaign to say 'Enough. We deserve to be heard. We want change.' It is that spirit I represent here in parliament today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2022 election was a watershed moment in our political history. The unprecedented wave of grassroots democracy has resulted in the largest-ever lower house crossbench. The parliament now has more women representing their communities than ever before. How did this wave of change happen? What was the secret? How does someone like me, a GP never previously active in politics, overcome more than a century of party-dominated politics? The key—the power, I believe—was simply listening. Like my other crossbench colleagues, I listened to my community. During the campaign my team and I asked our community: 'What do you care about? What type of representative do you want? How can your MP help to improve your quality of life and how can we work together?' The results of this new type of politics, of putting people first and of listening first, were astounding. I had people in their 80s and 90s tell me that it was the first time in their lives they had ever voted differently. Young people came up to me in the street asking if they could hug me, letting me know how grateful they were that, instead of being treated condescendingly, someone was finally listening and promising to act—promising to put their future first. In 2022, listening to our communities was our strength. It transformed our community, and now I hope it can transform our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people ask me how a GP got mixed up in politics. Well before my journey, I had watched in awe as the Independent movement swept across Indi and then Warringah. I was proud that professional women with no history in politics could take on the political establishment and win. That sense of pride grew when these women changed Australia for the better through their actions, their words and their integrity. In 2019, the election looming, I had my own lightning bolt moment. It came in the form of a 12-year-old boy, Mathias, a friend of my son. I had been troubled about the impact that climate change will have on the health and wellbeing of children and future generations for many years. On that day, my son and his friends were asking me about climate change, and I responded that, yes, one day they would need to act on it. Mathias looked up at me earnestly and said, 'Yes, because you adults have failed us.' He had a smile on his face. His comment found its target. I listened and I decided to act. As Cathy McGowan puts it so frequently, I realised that there was no cavalry coming over the hill to save us; there was only us. I had to do whatever I could to make a difference. If not you, then who? We've already been waiting two decades for action. However, I never imagined that my decision to act that day would end up with me standing here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague Monique Ryan quoted Albus Dumbledore in her first speech. Coming after her, I obviously need to try and outdo her, so I am quoting Gandalf:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge you to join me and step out onto the road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stepping up as a candidate wasn't easy for me. I've always been pretty horrified by public speaking, for one thing. I also gave up being a GP, a job that I loved, and I knew this role would take me away from my children and family. But I am thankful that my past as an athlete trained me to step outside of my comfort zone. As I had done thousands of times before in my previous life, my earlier life, I put myself into the race. Thankfully, I did not stand up alone. A group of strong, everyday women stood up alongside me—Anyo Geddes, Leonie Scarlett, Rebecca Clarke, Maree Nutt and Patti Burton—women who'd had their own lightning bolt moments and decided to act. Together, we sat down with locals around the kitchen tables of Mackellar, and in the cafes and parks, and we listened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did we learn? Time and again, climate change was the first issue people talked about, and that they were most desperate for the government to act on. We have been warned repeatedly by experts and scientists that climate change is the greatest threat to our environment, our health, our security and our economy, and that opening any more coal mines or gas mines is inconsistent with the Paris target and a liveable future. My question is: are we listening? Without a doubt, humans, however, respond to stories, not statistics. Recently I visited Lismore to hear people's stories of the floods from their own mouths. I can only think the courageous young woman who recounted her story for me, telling me how, without warning, in the middle of the night, cold, dark, swirling waters rose rapidly within inches of their ceiling. She told me of the hours-long struggle as she tried to keep herself, her mother and her dogs alive, of the warmth that started to spread throughout her body as hypothermia set in, of the people who held up their children, screaming for them to be rescued as an overloaded tinny took them to higher ground, and of her inability to work or simply take a bath since. The physical and mental scars from repeated extreme weather events will last for years to come. I ask you: are we listening? I believe that, if we do listen, if we act, if we take the community with us, we can prevent the worst impacts of climate change and we can grasp the window of opportunity to lead the world in the clean technology revolution, but we must act now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we listened over cups of tea, we also heard people's deep frustration at the all too frequent corruption in our politics. Australians do want a return to decency, accountability and integrity. They want to trust their representatives and have faith in their democracy. They want to have confidence that decisions are being made in their best interests, not vested interests. As we witness the rise of autocracy around the world, we understand how fragile democracy can be. Together we must work to keep our democracy strong. We must ensure that the institutions underpinning our democracy remain independent and well funded. We must ensure that political appointments to government agencies are independent and merit based and that this is enshrined in law. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trust is the glue that holds society together. Without trust, people lose faith in institutions and disengage from their democracy. Over the next three years I will be working hard with my colleagues to build transparency and accountability into our political processes so that our democracy will remain strong into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Mackellar also told us they want a strong economy and support for our local small-business community. During my time as a doctor, I've learnt that a strong economy supporting well-paid jobs and stability is the key driver of good health. A decent job gives people purpose and access to the fundamental determinants of health. A roof over someone's head is key to safety, security and prosperity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard how difficult it is for many people to make ends meet right now. Despite Mackellar's beauty, there are pockets of disadvantage. Young people, young families and essential workers, many of them women, are being locked out of the housing market and so forced to move out of the area. Small-business owners, teachers, nurses, and many others are reeling from the pandemic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can build an economy where small business thrives, where people, no matter their postcode, can prosper, where owning a home is not a distant possibility for young people. We need to act on housing affordability. We need to act on the cost-of-living pressures we are facing. Investing in renewables and making electric vehicles affordable for everyday Australians will mean lower energy bills and lower everyday costs of living for families and small businesses. As the member for Mackellar, I will work to grow our economy and support local businesses and those who are doing it tough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Mackellar also told us that they struggle to get the health and mental health care they need when they need it. Before becoming a GP, I worked as an emergency doctor at Mona Vale and other hospitals, so I know firsthand the importance of meeting our community's healthcare needs. Chronic disease, population growth, an ageing population, climate change and future pandemics will continue to strain our healthcare services. Now more than ever we must invest in our healthcare workforce and value their work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The World Health Organization has warned that climate change is the greatest threat to human health. It will strike the foundation of our health and wellbeing. In the Lismore region, for example, people are still living in tents. Crops and livestock were lost and local businesses destroyed. Housing security, food security and a stable income are the basis of health. We need to implement a national strategy for climate health and wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As your GP will tell you, prevention is better than cure. Acting now on the obesity epidemic will alleviate the burden of future chronic disease. Let's invest in primary health care and in prevention. Let's learn from this pandemic and plan for the next one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Youth mental health is also a pervasive concern for my community. Tragically, the Mackellar community has grieved the loss of too many young lives through suicide. Every young life that is lost is utterly devastating. We must do better. As a GP, I know just how difficult it is for young people and their families to access the mental health services and support they need. Understanding the fear and the extreme stress of parents trying their hardest to keep their children safe without adequate support, I would give them my mobile number so they would always have someone to call. We must prioritise expanding mental health services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The neglect of our aged-care system was also exposed by the pandemic. Reform is urgent. We need to ensure older Australians receive the respect and quality of care they deserve, so this week I look forward to supporting the government's bill for 24-hour nursing care and a cap on administration costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the benefit of my experience in medicine and public health, I will use my role here to prioritise building health and aged-care systems that will meet the challenges of our time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken a lot today about the power of simply being listened to, its empowering and healing effect. However, for too many years the voice of our First Nations people has not been heard. They weren't listened to when their land was taken away. They weren't listened to when their children were taken away. They weren't listened to when their ancestors' bones were stolen and they weren't listened to when their culture was suppressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru Statement from the Heart, the First Nations Voice to parliament and the makarrata—truth telling—are all generous invitations for us to listen so that healing can begin. After more than 200 years I hope Australia is finally ready to listen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly I want to say to the youth of Australia, I am listening to you and I have your back. I do feel that as politicians we do have a duty of care towards you. It is your future we are creating, so you do deserve to be heard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Please indulge me as I round off with a few thank yous and tributes. You don't often get such an opportunity as this. I wanted to first acknowledge my female forebears, who provided me with so much inspiration during the campaign. My grandmother, Dorothy Arnott, the second woman ever to graduate from vet school at Sydney University. My great aunt, Phyllis Arnott, the first woman in Australia to earn a commercial pilot's licence. My maternal grandmother, Joan Probert, who left school at the age of 16 to support the family after her father died. My mother, Jenny, always strong and upright, who taught her four children the simple yet important life lessons of right and wrong and of giving it your all. I thought of them often throughout the campaign and felt, if they could, I could. I am so grateful that, with bold spirits, they paved the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also deeply thankful to my husband and life partner, Adam Magro, for always believing in me and supporting me. Unfortunately, he is not here. He has COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my wonderful children Freddie, Jasper and Claude—you know already that all of the sacrifice is for you—your beautiful daily encouragements during the campaign—'you're doing a great job, mum' and 'keep it up'—did keep me going. And to my mother, my sister, Simone, my brothers, Daniel and Edouard, and my brother-in-law, Dave, thank you also for urging me on and keeping me laughing. Dad also would have enjoyed the ride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the 1,200-plus volunteers and the team that campaigned for change: we often spoke about the spirit of Mackellar during the campaign, and wow—didn't it shine brightly during those months? It showed in the glowing faces of the children smiling up at me; the teens wanting selfies; the honks from tradies; the hugs, the music that was played and the songs that were written; the dancing; the signs on the side of the streets; the expressions of deep gratitude from people who told me they felt hopeful for the first time in years. There were so many words of support. 'Feel the support, not the pressure,' I was told. We kept it positive, we kept it polite, we planned and we prepared. There was joy and there was such wonderful camaraderie. So many deep and lasting friendships and connections were made. It was an exhilarating ride, and it has only just begun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Jacqui Scruby, Louise Hislop and Chris Williams: you gave up your jobs to join me and worked tirelessly by my side every day of the campaign. You had my back in every way. The words 'thank you' do not seem enough. Anthony Reed and Mark Connelly: you guys are pure genius. It was an honour and a pleasure to work with you. Thank you to the rest of the campaign team: Leonie, Rebecca, Kay, Vivien, Seb, Cara, Amelia, Petra and Peta. The hours, the effort and the dedication you put in were nothing short of herculean. You helped make history and you made it fun. To Cathy McGowan, Kirsty Gold, Tina Jackson, Anna Josephson and Rob Purves: thank you for generously sharing your knowledge and providing unwavering support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the hundreds of donors in Mackellar, the more than 11,000 donors to Climate 200 from around the country and the incredible Climate 200 team themselves: thank you so much for putting your faith in me and in Mackellar and for giving us a fighting chance against all odds. Thank you for dreaming big.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> To my friend Anyo Geddes: you stepped out onto the road with me and we've taken every step on the journey together. Without you, none of us would be here. You are amazing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> Finally, to the people of Mackellar: know I am here on your behalf. I will work hard every day to ensure that the spirit of Mackellar burns brightly here in this chamber, that your voices and values are heard and respected, and that your vision for a brighter future can be realised. Thank you all for giving Mackellar back our voice. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  It is my great honour to stand here as the elected representative for Corangamite for a second term. I thank the people of Corangamite for placing their faith in me, and I will work hard each and every day to honour that faith. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Australian people have voted for a change of government. As a passionate advocate for my community for many years, it is with a sense of relief that I am now part of a government that will get things done and will be more compassionate and more accountable. I am proud of the Albanese Labor government's commitment to addressing the big issues and making structural and policy changes to improve the lives of all Australians. We have major challenges ahead, but, by putting the wellbeing of people and the protection of our environment at the heart of all policy, we have a positive agenda for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am particularly proud of the Albanese Labor government, which has, under the direction of my colleague the minister for industrial relations, introduced legislation to ensure all employees across Australia have access to 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. As a government, we are determined to meet these big challenges. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the mayor of the Surf Coast Shire, I and my team worked closely with the ACTU—and the then president Ged Kearney, who is now the honourable member for Cooper—and the Australian Services Union to introduce 10 days family violence leave across the Surf Coast municipality. We were the first council to do so—12 years ago. From little things big things grow, and now this fundamental and vital support has been embraced by councils and corporations across Australia. This legislation matters. It means people experiencing horrific and often hidden violence do not have to choose between keeping a job and a wage and fleeing family and domestic violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my constituents, the union movement and every person who has advocated for survivors of family violence for making this happen. In my role as member for Corangamite, I remain committed to representing the interests and concerns of my community. I have listened to my constituents, and they have told me that they care deeply about the big challenges we face: issues related to climate change, aged care, NDIS, health care, integrity in government, quality education, reliable communications, and decent roads that connect us to work, to schools and to essential services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my regional electorate, safe and reliable roads are essential; my constituents reminded me of it on a daily basis. This is why my government has committed $125 million to build the second stage of the Barwon Heads Road. This is a significant arterial link between the Bellarine and Geelong, in a rapidly growing part of my electorate. This critical piece of infrastructure will serve more than 60,000 residents in the next two decades. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My region and the nation face rising cost of living pressures, low wage growth, the devastating impact of climate change and a skills shortage. We are determined to face these big challenges and to overcome them. We cannot waste a single day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Investing in health care is one of our most important investments. It will become easier for people in my electorate to see a doctor and receive care under Labor's policy to provide automatic Distribution Priority Area classification to regional centres like mine. This means that places in my electorate, like Torquay, Ocean Grove and Bannockburn, will now have access to more doctors to employ in their clinics. This will ultimately help patients across my region to see a doctor for non-urgent care quicker and closer to home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is also delivering at least 50 urgent care clinics across the country to take the pressure off our emergency departments, which are struggling at the moment. We recognise this and we will deliver these urgent care clinics. I'm proud to say that there will be one in Geelong. We have announced it, and it will serve our region. These clinics will make it easier for families to see a doctor or a nurse when they have an urgent but not life-threatening care need. These clinics will bulk-bill and ease cost of living pressures on families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the previous government, the cost of seeing a GP increased by 43 per cent in my region. Labor is investing almost $1 billion in primary care through the Strengthening Medicare Fund to deliver better access and care for patients. With our Strengthening Medicare GP Grants, we will invest $220 million in our local GP practices after almost 10 years of Liberal cuts and neglect. These grants will provide funding for GPs to help them do things like upgrade IT systems, upskill staff, purchase new equipment and upgrade ventilation and infection control, at a time when we know that COVID is still ever present. It's time we made health care accessible and affordable for everyone, and it's time we properly supported our healthcare professionals during what is one of the most challenging periods in our history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to talk about child care now. In my electorate, we have many, many young families and lots of parents who rely on child care so they can get back to work. Labor's plan to make child care cheaper will help thousands of families in my region. No one should be penalised for taking on extra hours, extra days or a job. Cheaper child care will help mums and dads get ahead. Too many families are locked out of child care because it's just too expensive. Improving our child care system is a fundamental economic reform. Investing in child care will improve productivity and women's participation in the workforce, which will in turn help boost women's superannuation and reduce the gender pay gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, people will now get a fair go at work. Too many people are struggling on low wages, with poor working conditions. We can do so much better. We owe it to the Australian people to lift wages and conditions for workers across all sectors. We are part of the way there, with our increase in the minimum wage. We have committed to ensuring Australians have access to secure jobs, and we want decent wages and safe working conditions for all workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru Statement from the Heart is something that I and my Labor colleagues are passionate about. The implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, through Voice, Treaty and Truth, is an opportunity for healing, truth-telling and closing the gap. This will be a defining moment in our history, and I'm proud to be part of an Albanese Labor government, which is taking real action to promote unity and healing by holding a voice to parliament referendum in this term of government. We will work in genuine partnership with First Nations people for better outcomes. We know that, if we want change, we must allow the voices of First Nations people to be heard and to heal the traumas of the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was honoured to accompany the Minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, and Deputy Leader Richard Marles during the election campaign to announce Labor's investment in the Wathaurong Aboriginal Co-operative, which will benefit First Nations people in my electorate. This $15.6 million investment will go towards upgrading facilities. The upgrade will create a space that meets current and future needs, including additional health consulting rooms, meeting spaces and a conference centre. The Wathaurong services cover an area of 700 square kilometres across Geelong, Colac, the Bellarine Peninsula and the western metro region of Melbourne. This service supports a community of more than 3,500 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, providing families with a range of important supports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change and energy is another major commitment of Labor. We brought it to the election, and I know my community is so proud that we have stepped up on this. We will take action on climate change, and we will invest in renewable energy. I can assure my community that I will be working very hard to ensure that any manufacturing opportunities in relation to renewables are grasped by the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, Labor will deliver on a community battery for the Sands Estate community in Torquay. The Sands Owners Corporation worked hard over a long period of time to build a case for a community battery. They spoke to me frequently, talking about this important need. It was with great pride that, during the election campaign, I made a commitment towards this community battery. It will allow local households to feed solar power into the shared battery during the day and draw from it at night. This will cut electricity bills and reduce emissions and pressure on the grid, which we must upgrade. The Sands community aims to reach net zero by 2024. I applaud this community for its vision and commitment to reducing emissions. It perfectly illustrates Labor's Powering Australia plan, which has been backed by business and industry across the country and will help to cut power bills for thousands and thousands of families and businesses. I was particularly proud to make this announcement and am proud to see the project will begin soon and to work with them for its completion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, families across the Bellarine will have quicker and safer commutes to work, school and weekend sport, thanks to the $125 million commitment the Labor Party made in the lead-up to the election. Now in government we will be able to deliver it, to build stage 2 of the Barwon Heads Road duplication. By 2031 the Barwon Heads Road will carry up to 44,000 cars and trucks every day. If we don't build for that traffic growth now, locals will be trapped in an ever-growing gridlock. I want to assure my community that I will be working hard to deliver this in a timely manner, because I know how challenging it can be for many who currently use that road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also proud of my election commitment of $20 million towards a 50-metre indoor pool in Drysdale on the Bellarine Peninsula. This is a growing region. People deserve to be well, in good health, and to be able to exercise and connect. This pool will deliver on that. I surveyed almost 2,000 residents on the Bellarine and they overwhelmingly told me that they want this indoor pool. I am working with the local and state governments to deliver this exciting commitment for the people of the Bellarine. I look forward to seeing this opened in the first term of our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We pledged $6 million towards a regional high-ball sporting facility for the urban growth area of Armstrong Creek. The high-ball facility will help address a lag in sporting and community infrastructure and provide an opportunity to host regional tournaments in basketball, netball and other outdoor ball sports. The Commonwealth Games are also coming to the region. I look forward to working with our state government on any opportunities that arise. This high-ball centre will be a place for hundreds of local families. Kids, mums and dads will come together, meet each other and make friendships for years into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important commitment is a headspace for Armstrong Creek. Young people will finally have a dedicated service for early intervention mental health support. We committed $4.8 million to establish a full-service headspace centre in Armstrong Creek, which will also service the surrounding areas of Torquay, Jan Juc, Grovedale and Marshall. The Albanese government will support young people and their families through their mental health challenges. We know from COVID-19 the everyday pressures and the demand for mental health support. It has surged across Australia and certainly in my region it has impacted young people. They have come to me and spoken about the need for better services. I will work with the community to deliver a headspace for Armstrong Creek.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Corangamite has one of the highest number of veterans in the state, with over 2,000 veterans and family members. In the Greater Geelong region there are around 3,500 veterans and family members. We must do better to support them. The Albanese government will invest in defence personnel and veterans on the Surf Coast and in the Geelong region by providing $5 million in funding for a new veterans wellbeing centre. The hub will be a one-stop shop for veterans and their families to access a range of services, including transition, wellbeing support, advocacy, employment, housing assistance and, importantly, social connection. I will soon be consulting with local stakeholders, RSL branches and the community to find the best location for a hub.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past three years I have had a large number of environmentally active people from the region speak to me about the need to look at stormwater run-off. We have some of the most beautiful wetlands in Australia. The Karaaf wetlands in my region are currently facing decimation because the stormwater has not been treated well. The local council are very aware of how important these wetlands are, and I'll give them a shout-out for the work they're doing in that area. Before the last election we committed $1.9 million to looking at how we do better for these wetlands. I'm proud to say that, now in government, we can actually work on the Karaaf Wetlands restoration project, which is to the north of Torquay. The Karaaf Wetlands is 320 hectares of wild, open country, and it is hypersaline saltmarsh. It's also home to migratory waders from North Asia and the endangered orange-bellied parrot. The Albanese government is committed to protecting our important waterways and wetlands, and I will be proud to work with the community and the council to make sure that we improve these wetlands, that they are saline and that the stormwater run-off is managed in a way that is responsible and environmentally sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community batteries: they are the way of the future. Our government is recognising that. They offer people in the community an opportunity to reduce our emissions, use renewable energy and reduce energy bills at a local and community level. I'm very proud that, under the Albanese Labor government, Torquay will soon be home to one of the first community batteries, as I mentioned earlier. Importantly, there will be more opportunities for local communities to embrace this innovation, and it's something I'll be encouraging my community to take up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the importance of government financial support to local sporting and community clubs. These are grassroots organisations. They are the glue that binds us together. That's why my government is committed to a number of sporting and community upgrades across my electorate, including the Queenscliff Football Netball Club, the Leopold Memorial Recreation Reserve, the Portarlington Demons Football and Netball Club, the Torquay Tigers Football and Netball Club at Spring Creek, the Ocean Grove Memorial Recreation Reserve, Barwon Heads Football Netball Club and the Bannockburn Football Netball Club. These are all important organisations where people come together, where children play sport and where I've attended many, many times. It was a great pleasure to support these organisations, which are largely driven by volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also funding an active youth space project in Inverleigh and an expanded childcare service at the Bannockburn Family Services Centre and addressing a mobile black spot in St Leonards. Throughout my region, communications and mobile are, in many places, underdone. We need to do better, and I will be working with the Minister for Communications to ensure that my region is well connected and has reliable mobile services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a local member for Corangamite, I want to do my best for my constituents and for all Australians. Now in government, we will get down to work and deliver on our commitments and give all Australians a better future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  Deputy Speaker Goodenough, congratulations on your appointment to the panel. Thank you to the people of Cooper, an incredibly progressive group of constituents. At the last ABC survey, or the one before the last ABC survey, my electorate of Cooper was named the most progressive in the country. I believe it's been pipped at the post by the good people of Wills, ably represented here by my friend Peter Khalil, the member for Wills. The people of Cooper have told me what they care about. They care about climate change; they care about refugees; they care about decent jobs and the cost of living; they care deeply about the troubled aged-care sector; they care about homelessness and, of course, decent public education, health care and Medicare; and, importantly, they care about integrity in politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to say that I have one of the largest First Nations communities in urban Victoria in Cooper, and so the Uluru Statement from the Heart, voice, truth and treaty were first and foremost among the things they wanted me to progress here as their member. I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria, working towards treaty alongside the Yoorrook truth-telling commission, and congratulate Aunty Geraldine Atkinson and Marcus Stewart as co-chairs of the assembly. We are learning from them in Victoria, watching as we move towards advancing the Uluru statement, with the largest number of First Nations parliamentarians in the history of this parliament. I'm proud to say that they are led here in the government by Minister Linda Burney and special envoy Senator Pat Dodson, and I'd like in particular to acknowledge my very good friend and fellow Victorian Senator Jana Stewart on her election. My electorate, Cooper, is named after William Cooper, a First Nations activist who was brave and relentless in the fight for self-determination, spearheading the struggle for a voice to parliament all those years ago, albeit via a petition to the then king.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a wonderful start to parliament we've had, with that welcome to country by Dr Aunty Matilda House-Williams and her son Paul reiterating the urgency around the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Last weekend at Garma we heard a wonderful speech from our Prime Minister, a speech that spoke of generosity and gracious acceptance of that offer. He spoke of manners, of this being a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to walk with our First Peoples, and said that, whilst acknowledging the atrocities of the past, we can create a better future—one we can look back on at the end of the day with pride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of your life, you want to look back. You want to look back and think you made a difference for the better. We all try, of course, in our own way: raising our kids right, helping our neighbours, volunteering, being as good a person as we can. But, my goodness, here in this House we have been given a great opportunity, a privilege not afforded to everyone, to make a difference—to make a difference as a government for the ages, even beyond our mortal selves. It is Labor governments that do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has said his will be a government that leads with heart. I want to be here with him. I'm proud to be here with him and this government to do just that. The first day's legislative agenda did show what we mean. Changed standing orders to create family-friendly hours was one of the first pieces of legislation tabled in this House, responding to the Jenkins report in full. This place should be an exemplary workplace and set the standard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Climate Change and Energy introduced his comprehensive bill, the most comprehensive plan supported by all sectors of society, setting up the architecture for us to launch our future as a renewable energy superpower, and a big call-out to all the climate activists in my electorate who are passionate about this and committed to saving the planet. Aged care, with years of neglect—so many of my constituents begged me to convince the previous government to act on aged care, and I am so proud to tell them we will. We stood here and tabled legislation to abolish the cashless debit card—a racist, punitive invention of the previous government. We will help seniors with the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet to come is a wonderful agenda: universal childcare support, protecting the environment, and paid family and domestic violence leave. It was incredible to sit here in the House and listen to the minister introduce that legislation, something that I personally have fought for for decades. We are strengthening Medicare, fixing the GP shortage and assuring our exhausted health workforce that we are here to make things better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to have a jobs and skills summit to make sure that we are prepared for the future, looking at insecure work, women's participation, all-ability-inclusive workforces and skills shortages. We will look seriously at the role of immigration for skilled workers as a pathway to permanency as well as improving productivity for this country. We will look to abolishing indefinite detention and getting rid of punitive temporary visas for people seeking asylum, making sure there are pathways to permanent residency and safe resettlement. Of course, as I mentioned, there is the Uluru Statement from the Heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Cooper is a vibrant, diverse electorate. It's home to ten-pound Poms and their families. It's home to post-war families who moved into Reservoir before the roads were sealed. It's home to a marvellous mix of migrants from Italy, Greece, China, Vietnam, Macedonia, African countries, the Middle East—you name it; we have them here in Cooper, and it's wonderful. It's home to artists, manufacturers, brewers, thousands of small businesses and, of course, the wonderful La Trobe University and dozens of fantastic schools. It's home to sports nuts of all types, from roller derby world champions to lawn bowlers. It is a large and vibrant First Peoples community, home to the Aboriginal Advancement League, the legacies of William Cooper and Sir Doug Nicholls, and Aunty Alma Thorpe's Gathering Place at Dardi Munwurro. I stand here privileged to be the member for Cooper.</span>

On behalf of the Returned Services League Joondalup city subbranch, ably led by veterans, and in the spirit of bipartisanship, I call upon the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the new Albanese government to honour the commitment made by the previous government to provide for the relocation of the Ocean Reef War Memorial to a new permanent site at the redeveloped Ocean Reef Marina. Impending construction work at the site means that the memorial arch constructed of steel and glass, built to commemorate the centenary of the Anzac landings at Gallipoli, will soon need to be dismantled and placed into storage. With $1.5 million in federal funding, DevelopmentWA will be able to restore the memorial to a new waterfront site for our community and future generations of Australians to gather for Anzac Day and Remembrance Day to remember the sacrifice of all veterans for our country. </span>

The Vietnamese Museum Australia will preserve and celebrate Vietnamese heritage and culture, including the stories of at least 110,000 Vietnamese refugees who were welcomed by Australia between 1975 and 1995. </span>

For each of these stories there is a person or a family whose life was completely disrupted, who had to leave everything behind, who had to undertake an incredibly perilous, often life-threatening, journey. Many of these people spent years in refugee camps. All of these people were ultimately welcomed by Australia—something that I think everybody in this chamber is now proud of—and all of these people in that period and since have repaid that gesture many, many times over. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  The $50 million Trailblazer funding investment, made under the previous government, is the single largest amount of government funding that UniSQ has ever received. This investment opens a door to a whole new universe of opportunities for future generations of local kids who are interested in exploring the emerging field of space engineering. Who would have thought, even at the turn of the century, that Toowoomba, a city known for its agricultural strength, would emerge as the leader in our nation's space research, and yet this is the reality that we face. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond research this means a whole new manufacturing industry for our region and strengthens ties to future defence capabilities. We've seen Boeing base its Loyal Wingman program at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre at the Wellcamp airport, and we're growing our local defence industry in our region. The lessons, sadly, from Russia's war with Ukraine show that, more and more, our national defence will rely upon brilliant minds and new technologies supporting our brave boots on the ground, and I'm so proud to think that our region can continue to contribute in this way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chancellor John Dornbusch, Vice-Chancellor Geraldine Mackenzie and particularly Professor Peter Schubel are to be commended for their relentless advocacy for this funding. As Groom continues to broaden its economy, creating new opportunities for upcoming generations, this addition will be remembered not as a small step but as a giant leap. I thank all involved for their tremendous efforts, including the fantastic members for Wright and Toowoomba North.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Last weekend we mourned, remembered and commemorated the lives of 18 men who lost their lives in the Box Flat coalmining disaster in Ipswich 1972. I want to thank President Hugh Taylor and the Ipswich Historical Society for the great work they did over the weekend, including the unveiling of the mine's rescue display and the memorial service, which was very moving, last Sunday. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After Box Flat and multiple inquiries, including a mining warden's inquiry, changes were made to law, regulation, safety and testing. On 31 July 1972 at 2.47 am—I remember the explosion myself—17 miners were killed in an explosion at the Box Flat coalmine in Swanbank, near Ipswich. Another man lost his life 19 months later. Eight of the men lost that day were members of the Booval Mines Rescue Brigade who had bravely gone back into the mine in an attempt to extinguish and seal off the fire and to save their mates. It remains the worst mining disaster in Ipswich's history and one of the greatest losses of life in Queensland's mining industry. The entrances were sealed, and the bodies were never recovered. My heart goes out to those families, who have suffered for generations and endured loss and pain. Thank you to Hugh and the Ipswich Historical Society for what they did over the weekend for those families.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  One of the major brakes on economic development in Tasmania is the cost of getting people, vehicles and freight across Bass Strait, which is why we urgently need enhancement of both the Bass Strait freight equalisation scheme and the passenger vehicle equalisation scheme. Only then will Tasmanians enjoy genuine parity with mainland transport costs—which is more important than ever, as the state recovers from pandemic lockdowns and border closures and if Tasmania is to take full advantage of the current tourist boom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The equalisation schemes have tried to cover the gaps, but frankly they've never come close to offsetting the added cost of crossing the strait. Moreover, some businesses tell me that it costs them more to pay the staff to fill out the paperwork to access the subsidies than what they actually save from the subsidies themselves. After the last federal government's attempt to further subsidise passenger vehicle fares resulted in gross price hikes for customers, rather than savings, it's clear that a more effective scheme is needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost for freight, vehicles and passengers to cross the strait should be no more than the cost to travel the same distance on Highway 1 on the mainland, so I call on the new government to finally implement an effective subsidy scheme that applies to all outbound and inbound people, vehicles and freight. Only then will Tasmania's economy be truly unleashed. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  In Goldstein you'll find vast open spaces and sporting fields, which, on most evenings, are full of children and adults training and, on the weekend, are full of people playing sport. At this time of year, many of those fields and pavilions are being used by teams playing Aussie Rules, and, in happy news, those teams are more and more frequently made up of women and girls motivated by the advent of the AFLW. But in several cases there is a lack of adequate changing facilities to cater for men and women training and playing on overlapping schedules. At the landmark Trevor Barker Beach Road Oval at Sandringham, for example, this is the case. The facilities at Trevor Barker, along with those at Peterson Street Reserve in Highett, in Brighton Beach, had all been earmarked for funding by the previous federal government, in partnership with Bayside City Council. There's now uncertainty within these sporting clubs, which are so central to our community and our environment, about their planned upgrades. Across Goldstein, in Bentleigh, Cheltenham and elsewhere, some girls change into their sports kit in the car, due to the lack of privacy and appropriate space to change. I call on the government to partner with local councils, state government and the AFL to ensure that girls and women—and, indeed, people of all genders—can access safe and fit-for-purpose changing facilities to enable equitable access to playing sport. I would be pleased to work with the government on these changes. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  I want to take this opportunity to talk about the upcoming World 9s Aussie Rules international event, coming to Darwin on Saturday 13 August. The World 9s is run by Australian Football International and it has adapted rules because we play on rectangular fields, either a soccer or a rugby field. There are only nine players, instead of the usual 18. It makes it more accessible and easier to organise compared to the traditional Australian Rules game. As all honourable members know, few things bring people together like sports. We have many multicultural communities in Darwin, and many of them will be represented at this competition, which will include a Greek team, a Timor-Leste team, a Pacific island team, a team from the Irish community and a Larrakia team—the traditional owners of the Darwin region. For this competition, it has been a real privilege to work with and sponsor the newly formed Darwin Lions, which is a team consisting of players from Darwin's vibrant African community. Sport is such a fundamental part of life in the Territory, so I can't wait for what will be a cracking carnival on 13 August. While I'm up on my feet talking about sport, as the chair of the parliamentary rugby club I am very proud to say that we played Balmain recently and we were, very humbly, victorious in that game! </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  It's a truism of politics that governments, when they're elected, bring to office a set of policies, a plan, a mandate and an agenda for anything to do with the critical issues of our time. And yet, when we look at the government so far, Australians are rightly asking: what is the plan on the economy? When we look ahead, Australians can see already—we've been looking at it for some time—that inflation is on the rise and interest rates are on the rise. The challenges facing the economy are more than ever before, and so Australians rightly ask the government: What is the plan? What is the agenda? What is the mandate? What is the policy that you bring? We have a Treasurer who has come forward with a PhD in economics, who spent time working for allegedly the best Treasurer in the world and who has had time in opposition to formulate a plan. Instead, the government came forward last week with a painting—it painted a picture. It served as a data collection agency and said: 'Here are a set of facts that are very troubling about the economy coming forward.' What we would like to know, what the Australian people would like to know, what small businesses would like to know, what everyone who is struggling with power prices, with the prices of goods and services, would like to know is: what will the plan be? We know so far the government have said, 'We're going to have a summit.' That's all well and good, but the question that we really need to focus on with laser-like focus is: what is the agenda? When you get to government, you need that plan. You need to implement the plan. You need to deliver on your policies.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Sadly, last week, on 27 July, a man lost his life on Appin Road in my electorate of Macarthur. We've been talking about Appin Road really since 2015, when approval was mooted for a Lendlease development on one side of that road. There was increasing traffic from the port of Wollongong coming along Appin Road, through my electorate of Macarthur, through Campbelltown and into Sydney. There had been a number of deaths on the road. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shamefully, nothing has changed. In the last two decades, 25 people have lost their lives on that road. It's a very dangerous two-lane road—one lane each way—surrounded by heavily wooded areas with large trees. If you make a mistake on Appin Road, there is no way out, and it is very likely you will lose your life. Liberal-National governments have done nothing about that in spite of entreaties over years. We have been talking and talking. We can't even get the ministers for the New South Wales state government out to look at the road. We need koala protections on that road, but most of all we need attention to that road so lives can be saved. I have called for a summit of federal, state and local government members to try and finally get some action on the very dangerous Appin Road. We all should be ashamed of what's happening.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  If you go down into the heart of Macnamara you will find the magnificent Shrine of Remembrance. It's a great and fitting tribute to the men and women who have served our country, and it stands there to celebrate and to thank those who have given the ultimate sacrifice—including many who, even in their time in Australia, had conditions and settings put on them that were unfair, like our First Nations service men and women, who served our country even without the right to vote in this country; and, of course, our LGBTIQ service men and women, who, up until recently, had to hide their identity as part of their service to our defence forces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, in their latest exhibition, the Shrine of Remembrance was celebrating the LGBTIQ service men and women who participated and served our nation. I think it was a wonderful tribute to those who have been often sidelined and those who have faced difficult circumstances. Unfortunately, as part of that exhibition, many of the staff at the shrine have faced threats of violence and threats of intimidation by members of the public, and they had to cancel a display of pride at the Shrine of Remembrance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just say that in Macnamara we are so proud of the shrine and we are proud of all of the men and women who have served our defence forces. Regardless of their race, gender, sexuality or whoever they are, we are proud of them, and we thank them for who they are.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Deputy Speaker Claydon, congratulations on your position. My electorate of Petrie in Queensland is rich with sporting clubs, and I am proud of the sporting culture that exists within the Petrie community. I was recently invited to attend the North Lakes Blues Netball Club grand opening, and they officially unveiled their four new netball courts. Prior to this, North Lakes had no publicly available netball courts, and the club was forced to hire courts at a significant expense which was passed on to players.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The club's president, Samantha Malopito, and I met back in 2017. She told me that she had approached different levels of government, pleading with them to help the displaced club. I acted immediately and was able to get a petition signed by all the players of the North Lakes Blues and their families, volunteers and coaches, and I was able to secure $1 million in federal funding from the coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge Division 4 councillor Jodie Shipway, who was also very supportive and secured council funding. As well as Samantha Malopito and her family, I'd like to acknowledge the club's volunteer executive treasurer, Nicole George, who was brilliant at helping implement this funding through council, Secretary Jodie Kilian and Vice-President Sonia O'Brien for their instrumental advocacy. Stories like this are why the Albanese government must prioritise funding for community grants in their October budget or risk losing touch with the community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Firstly, Arts Deloraine had their midwinter festival, called WinterFire, with arts, music and produce in the beautiful Meander Valley. There was just so much on and I was sorry I couldn't be there.

It was a fundraiser up in Deloraine, a wonderful initiative organised by family daycare educators Tammy Hilder and Susanna Haberle. They invited me to participate. Of course, I donated.

Stories remain, though, of personal hardship more than two years after the fires devastated my community. There are also stories in relation to community facilities. Community facilities are so important because they give an opportunity for communities to come together and assist each other in the recovery process.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many positives. We have worked successfully across the state and federal governments to identify local priorities and secure funding for projects in my region. But there does need to be a greater sense of urgency to get these projects actually delivered. I acknowledge that the COVID pandemic and the supply chain difficulties which have ensued have made it harder for communities to recover, but we do need to see a greater sense of urgency across the bureaucracy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two of the most heavily impacted communities in my electorate were Sarsfield and Ensay. They originally were deemed ineligible for Black Summer bushfire recovery grants. But we were able to overcome this technicality in relation to the ABN numbers and the heavy-handed bureaucratic approach of the NRRA to secure $5.9 million through the former Deputy Prime Minister's office to upgrade the recreational facilities at both Sarsfield and Ensay. The critical point is that this funding was announced on 24 March this year, around two months before the election. This is not a question of an announcement being made in the caretaker period. It was a victory for communities and a victory for common sense. Since the election, though, there has been no news in relation to these grants. I have written to both the ministers responsible. I am urging them to show some common sense and support these communities as they recover from the Black Summer bushfires.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I'm pleased to let the House know that last month the Lions Club of Eltham held their changeover dinner. While, unfortunately, I couldn't personally attend, I have heard the reports from the dinner and I'm really pleased to have been updated on the work of this great community group. I want to pay special tribute to Peter Talbot, who is a local Eltham legend. I recognise the many years of service he has given to the club and to his local community, and I congratulate him and thank him for once again taking on the role of president.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Lions Club of Eltham was formed in 1976, and it's spent the last 46 years in service to the residents of my electorate of Jagajaga and the surrounding area. Anyone who knows the Lions Club knows that no job is too big and no job is too small. In fact, they pick up so many of those things that fall between the cracks elsewhere. They run a legendary sausage sizzle. I myself have enjoyed it a number of times. And I know that people, particularly older people, in my electorate appreciate the services that they provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So congratulations to the Eltham Lions. They're part of a broader group of more than 25,000 Lions members across Australia who provide this service in their communities. I'm really proud to provide my support to local groups such as the Eltham Lions. I know that they continue to make lives better in my community and in others across the country.</span>

But what we have seen so far is the so-called party of the worker put jobs at risk by stalling funding commitments made to our Aussie manufacturers. Projects totalling over a billion dollars, budgeted through the Morrison government's Modern Manufacturing Initiative, are at risk of being torn up by this industry minister. These are projects in critical industries: defence, national security, food security, recycling and, importantly, medical products.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been a week since I first called for the minister to do something, and what have we heard? Nothing. Crickets. Well, crickets are not going to create the jobs and economic certainty that employers and manufacturers are crying out for. Instead, the government initiates a value-for-money review, ignoring the fact that a comprehensive assessment by an independent committee is already taking place. With soaring electricity prices, labour shortages and rising inflation, Australian manufacturers cannot afford a government which does not deliver on commitments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I wrote to the minister on behalf of all manufacturers across the nation to ask, 'Why the delay?' and to call on the minister to immediately confirm their funding arrangements. Labor's actions cast a dark cloud over these manufacturing businesses, apprentices, trainees, their families and our communities—and a dark cloud over our economy. The minister needs to step up, come clean and sort it out.</span>

Our country has lost a brilliant talent, a powerful and prolific national truth-teller. Archie's music drew from a well of trauma and pain, but it flowed with beauty and a resonance that moved us all. We will always have his voice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As he sang Archie gave Australia a priceless gift, with songs informed by his own experiences as a member of the Stolen Generations. He brought us face to face with the truth. His music spanned the breadth of the human experience. He was an elder, a storyteller. He was a source of wisdom, compassion, encouragement, generosity and forgiveness.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The circumstances of Archie's life may have been tough, but they never ever hardened his indomitable spirit, and above all of that it shone through to us in the music. He sang to us with love and patience, but he also sang with a humility that was as powerful as his talent. Indeed, he never asked anything of us, just to open our ears. And yet he opened his heart to us, his strong but tender heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His voice arrived like a warm embrace, and in the process he made the universe feel just that much bigger. Archie took us to some beautiful places, but the path he took us on to get that beauty could sometimes be a rugged one. He did not shy away from either pain or sadness, but neither did he from love. As Archie put it: empathy was his impetus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

While we grieve Archie's death, we will try to heed his words: 'We won't cry. Oh, we will lift our spirits high, up to the sky.' We will hold onto everything that Archie Roach gave us. We will celebrate him and all that he created. What a remarkable man. What a privilege that our lives overlapped with his. May he rest in peace.</span>

Forcibly removed from his family at the age of two, raised in foster homes, learning of the death of his biological mother and father via letter, living rough on the streets battling alcoholism and doing prison time, Archie Roach had every right to be resentful and vindictive, given the hardships of his early life. Yet, in his autobiography he wrote: 'People ask me if I ever get sick of singing my song "Took the Children Away". I tell them it is my healing song. Through songs I have been able to deal with the pain and trauma in a positive way.' Through music Archie was able to forgive and to heal. Indeed, 'Took the Children Away' did the same for many of the Stolen Generations and it helped the nation to come to terms with the actions of his forebears. Archie wrote: 'I believe in redemption and I believe in forgiveness, both important aspects of love, because I've experienced both.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the love of his foster family, the Coxes, which inspired his love of music. And, if music helped Archie to forgive then it was Ruby Hunter who brought about his redemption. Both children of the Stolen Generations and sharing a love for music, their partnership was the catalyst of change in fortune. Archie found his voice and audience in music. He found his rhythm and calling in life—a life which would take him from opening for Paul Kelly and the Messengers in 1989 to releasing a career-spanning anthology in March this year; a life which would see his talent recognised as the recipient of ARIAs, Deadly Awards and National Indigenous Music Awards; and a life which would see his service to our country acknowledged by his being made a Member of the Order of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It speaks volumes that a man who suffered and voiced the trauma of the Stolen Generations was able to write: 'Live a good life, be the best person you can be and always let love be your guide.' Australians will continue to be inspired by the lyrics and legacy of Archie Roach. On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to all of Archie's colleagues and friends, and to the entire Roach family, especially Amos and Eban, Archie's sons, and Kriss, Arthur and Terrence, Archie's foster children. May he rest in peace.</span>

ABS data shows electricity prices increased, on average, by 12.9 per cent per year when Labor was last in government, compared to just 0.3 per cent during the previous coalition government. Given the Prime Minister has now dumped his promise to cut power prices for Australian families by $275, can the Prime Minister cut the hubris and tell Australian families whether power prices will be higher or lower when they get their next bill?</span>

I'm happy to outline for the benefit of the House what the circumstances are when they get their next bill. We of course did have a policy, which we announced on 3 December last year. On 31 March this year the Governor-General, acting on the minister's advice, signed a determination to delay the publication of the default market offer for energy prices. On 6 April a determination to amend paragraph 17(2)(c) of the electricity retail industry code was registered and published. On 7 April the determination with the delayed date came into effect. Guess when the election was called—10 April. So three days before the election was called, this minister went to the GG and put in a determination to change the industry code to keep it secret. On 11 April parliament was prorogued and caretaker commenced. The first of May—May Day—was the previous publication date the default market offer that they deleted. Election day was on 21 May, and guess when they published it. Was it before or after 21 May? What do you think? Hands up those who think it might have been before the election! Hands up those who think it was after the election!</span>

This weekend at the Garma Festival, on Yolngu country, the Prime Minister delivered the most important speech on Indigenous affairs by a prime minister since the apology to the Stolen Generations in 2008. The Prime Minister recommended a simple question to be put to the Australian people in a referendum: do you support an alteration to the Constitution that establishes an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice? It is a simple proposition, a question from the heart.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I went around the festival, the sense of excitement was quite overwhelming—traditional owners from right across Australia looking forward with a sense of hope about the future, because they understand that a voice to the parliament is about both symbolism and practical outcomes, like education, health and housing and around family violence. A voice to the parliament will mean that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders will be consulted and heard on policies that affect them. These are practical outcomes that will make a real difference to people's lives: fairness, respect. That's what the voice is all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm encouraged by the opposition keeping an open mind on supporting the referendum, and I want to sincerely thank the member for Berowra for attending Garma with myself and the Prime Minister. I also want to acknowledge the former minister and my dear friend Ken Wyatt for the important foundations he put in place on this. We have been talking about recognising First Nations people in our country's founding document for a long time. It is time to get this done together.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General and Cabinet Secretary</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:14</span>):  I thank the member for Canberra for her question and acknowledge her longstanding interest in this matter. The Uluru Statement from the Heart is a generous offer from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of our country with a simple but powerful message about a pathway forward to a better future, a better future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—absolutely—but also a better future for all Australians. One of the things the Statement from the Heart calls for is the establishment of a First Nations Voice, and it asks for the voice to be included in the Constitution. It is a modest request. It is simply a request from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that they be consulted about decisions that affect them. This is not just a matter of fairness, respect or common decency—although it is that too; it is also a matter of common sense, because when Commonwealth governments have consulted with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about the policies that affect them, the results have been policies and programs that are more effective and more enduring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In answering the specific question of why it is important for a First Nations Voice to be included in the Constitution, I echo the words of the Prime Minister at the Garma Festival on Saturday. Including a voice in the Constitution gives strength and status to the principles of respect and consultation. Including a voice in the Constitution means that a willingness to listen to the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people won't depend on who is in government or who is the Prime Minister from time to time; the voice will endure regardless. Including a voice in the Constitution means that the voice cannot be silenced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former Chief Justice of the High Court Robert French said in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> this morning, the inclusion of the voice in the Constitution would be 'itself an act of recognition' but one that 'has the practical benefit of providing a means by which parliament and the executive government can be informed about the effects of proposed or existing laws, policies and practices in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of why it has to happen in this term of parliament, I again echo the words of the Prime Minister: 'If not now, when?' It has been already five years since the Uluru Statement from the Heart and we should not wait another five.</span>

It's not the government's intention to apply a windfall tax to the gas companies. Obviously we listen respectfully to the views that are put to us from right around the country about the best ways to deal with these cost-of-living pressures, a big part of which are skyrocketing energy costs. We listen respectfully to the proposals that are put to us, but we are not currently working up a windfall tax or anything that looks like that as we deal with the complex combination of economic circumstances that we have inherited as a new government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have a policy on multinational taxes, which is part of making sure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax here in Australia so that we can invest that money in some of those areas that the member for Ryan is right to identify, whether it be Medicare, whether it be child care or whether it be investments in education and skills, all of these important areas. One of our defining tasks as a government that we have embraced, the finance minister and I, indeed the whole cabinet, the whole party room, is: how do we take money which has been spent on unproductive purposes for a political dividend and redirect that money in the interests of the Australian people into areas which do deliver a social dividend and an economic dividend as well? As the creators of Medicare—as the creators of so many of these programs that we cherish—we are looking for ways to more responsibly fund those priorities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the energy market in particular, we have said today—indeed, the Minister for Resources has said today, and others, like the Prime Minister, have said today—our focus in the energy market is on security and affordability, some of the issues which have been raised by the ACCC in the report that I released overnight, which go to making sure that Australians can access the energy that they need at affordable prices. That's a big reason why inflation is what it is: energy prices are going through the roof. We're conscious of that, and we're working to ensure that we can responsibly address that. But the proposal that the member for Ryan has respectfully put to us is, respectfully, not a path that we are going down.</span>

It was indeed an honour to attend the Garma festival, to meet with elders and to listen to their concerns. It was an honour to go with so many of my parliamentary colleagues, including the Minister for Indigenous Australians; the Attorney-General; the Assistant Minister for Indigenous Australians, Senator McCarthy; of course Senator Patrick Dodson, the father of reconciliation in this country; the member for Berowra, the shadow minister, who travelled up with us on Friday—I thank you for your attendance; and the local members, the member for Lingiari and the member for Solomon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Five years on, it's time that we all walk the walk with Indigenous Australians. I believe that Australia can rise to this moment and advance reconciliation by recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our birth certificate, our Constitution. It's not a matter of special treatment. It's not a matter of preferential power. It's about consulting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples on decisions that affect them.</span>

                  </span>In the draft of the constitutional change that I spoke about on Saturday, it makes it very clear—the primacy of the parliament is not affected. It is also the case that it's not a matter of a voice or practical measures to close the gap; it's a matter of a voice being a vehicle to advance practical measures to close the gap. We know that, when a government listens to people with experience, with earned knowledge in culture and community, the policies and programs are always more effective, whether they be justice reinvestment programs or programs for Indigenous rangers. Where you consult people and give them that sense of ownership, you get better practical outcomes. The voice can empower communities, create opportunity, deliver justice and give security. This is an opportunity to uplift our entire nation. We need to seize that opportunity.</span>

We are going about implementing our election commitments, because we know, on this side of the House, that clean energy is cheap energy. We have already started implementing our policies to move renewables to 82 per cent of our grid. It is the case that the former minister for energy didn't just not issue a release, he actually had to physically intervene to change the law. He sat in his office and signed an instrument to change the locks. He probably sat in his office and then once he'd done it he thought to himself: 'Fantastic. Well done, Angus.' That's what he thought. We've got the former minister for energy who sat on energy price rises. We've got the former minister for environment who sat on the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the environment</span> report. The entire leadership group of the opposition is a walking witness protection program. I'm surprised they don't have their meetings in a safe house.</span>

High gas prices are making life harder for Australians, for Australian industries and for Australian employers. Wholesale gas prices in the second quarter of this year, around the time of the election, were more than three times higher than at the same time last year. That's why in June I worked closely with the minister for energy and the Minister for Resources and together we tasked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate skyrocketing gas prices, to consider the supply of gas to domestic versus export markets and advise the government of any regulatory changes that might be required. I want to thank the ACCC and particularly its chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, for the first-class report that I've released publicly today, which combines an aspect of their regular monitoring with the extra work that we asked them to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It contains some sobering reading, particularly in relation to these three warnings that they issued. First, the upstream gas market is highly concentrated. Around 90 percent of the market is dominated by three major players. Second, exporters aren't always meeting the spirit of their obligations to the domestic market under the heads of agreement. Third, the domestic market faces a major supply shortfall in 2023 unless action is taken to fix the regime. In other words, the arrangements set up by those opposite aren't working to ensure enough domestic gas at competitive prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC made it really clear that the timing of the gas trigger isn't flexible enough and the rules are too narrow. The heads of agreement isn't working either, because companies aren't consistently offering gas to the domestic market with reasonable notice or at reasonable prices. Most of our excess gas, the gas that isn't contracted, is being exported to the international spot market to take advantage of the current conditions. The domestic shortage that comes from this is expected to be about one-tenth of the domestic supply that we need next year. But here's the thing: there's enough uncontracted gas to meet our needs in Australia if the spirit of the heads of agreement is adhered to. That's why the steps outlined by the Minister for Resources today are so important and why they are called for and supported by the ACCC: to reform the trigger and take the first step towards activating it, to consult on the best ways to go about it and to improve the heads of agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all about two things: more gas for Australia, at more competitive prices. As the PM said, we will take the necessary steps to make that happen. We call on the gas companies to do the right thing by our workers and by our industries. We can do all this without jeopardising our trade relationships and our reputation as a reliable exporter of energy. We are looking for solutions here, not unnecessary conflict. A decade of slogans, of 22 failed energy policies and of wasted opportunities has cost Australians and their industries too much already.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:34</span>):  I thank the member for Parramatta for his question and I also congratulate him on his election victory. This is also the first opportunity I've had to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your elevation to that great role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The east coast energy crisis has been 10 years in the making—all from those opposite. Twenty-two times they failed to implement an energy policy. This is the mess they have left this country in. Today we see, as the Treasurer said, that the ACCC gas inquiry report has told us that we can expect a 56 petajoule shortfall in 2023. That's the equivalent of about 14 cargoes of LNG 'K' Line carriers going out from the ports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While those opposite when they were in government engaged in petty internal squabbles about energy policy, this government will act and has acted. For a start, this government has extended and will extend the life of the ADGSM. This is the trigger you were calling for us to pull, yet it doesn't exist at the moment. That right does not exist, because you failed to extend the life of that mechanism. Those opposite hid energy prices and the <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the environment</span> report. They also failed to extend the life of the ADGSM, and they all march around calling for us to pull that trigger. First things first, people. Let's make sure it's actually extended. That process is underway. In fact, one of the very first decisions of this government was to extend that, because we could see this coming. We did not put our head in the sand. Those opposite most certainly have done so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government today has also opened consultation in regard to reform of the ADGSM to ensure it is an effective tool and is fit for purpose, so that it is available on more than an annual basis. This is a means to make sure there will be an opportunity to activate a gas security mechanism more often on more reasonable notice, and that can bring downward pressure on gas prices. The current mechanism fails to do any of those things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also start negotiations on the heads of agreement. This agreement has been referred to in the media as a gentlemen's agreement. I have no idea why. That's what happens in this place sometimes. With the heads of agreement the target is to get the uncontracted gas—of which there is a sufficient amount—to make sure there will be adequate and reasonably accessible gas for Australians and Australian manufacturers. It is important work that this government is about to commence. We will renegotiate the heads of agreement to make sure it is effective. When those opposite were in government they implemented the ADGSM and the heads of agreement, and ever since the gas companies have ignored them. We will make sure it works and works for the Australian people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

If I may, can I start by congratulating you, Mr Speaker, on your election, and also congratulate the member for his election as the member for Hunter. As a former fitter and boilermaker, he knows full well the impact of these issues on manufacturing, and I welcome the chance to respond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gas price rise has been a serious problem for manufacturing across the country, but obviously for companies and manufacturers in the Hunter—represented by the member, and also the member for Paterson—they're gas reliant manufacturers. They're big employers, particularly in regional Australia and our outer suburbs. They are obviously concerned about the increase in price, but we should also take a moment to thank those manufacturers who have held on to jobs. They've worn some of those price increases, held on to jobs and protected regional communities. We are very grateful and thank them for that. They are dependent on the adequate supply of gas at a fair price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC today clearly laid bare those flaws in the domestic gas market that were outlined by the Treasurer: concentration in the market; a failure to adhere to the spirit of the heads of agreement; and there has been a concern around the shortfall and the pressure that will place on manufacturing. From our point of view, if you look at the way in which that has played out, gas prices themselves going from a shade under $8 a gigajoule a few years ago to the average spot price now being about $44, that is a huge increase. And the reality is this: we have multinational companies extracting an Australian resource to sell to international clients at a price that's squeezing Australian industry and jobs. Something has to be done about it, and I think there will be a lot of manufacturers today welcoming the announcement by the Minister for Resources to start the consultation around the ADGSM, because we do need to see some movement on this. We do need to see this fixed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a lot of talk from those opposite during their time in government, but the reality is what they've put in place does not work and needs to be adjusted—not just in terms of supply. Supply is one thing, but the price at which it is offered is another. It is reflective of a poor legacy: 22 failed policies by those opposite and a failure to get this right, and manufacturers have been forced to pay the price for that. This is not right. It is something that we are determined to correct, and we are taking action to do just that.</span>

Repeated infections of COVID-19 tend to be more severe and carry a high risk of persistent symptoms for as long as six months, as well as an increased risk of hospitalisation and death. There's increasing risk of cumulative neurological and cardiovascular disease from repeated infections of COVID-19. COVID-19 infections in this country are at a record high and increasing. Can the minister please explain how he proposes to manage the oncoming national significant burden of disability and chronic illness from repeated infection of COVID-19?</span>

She's one of a large number of doctors and health professionals now in this parliament who, together, are going to add enormous quality and depth to our deliberations on health policy. There can be no more important time than right now for that because this pandemic, as the member points out, is still ravaging our community. Official numbers record that more than 300,000 Australians each and every week are being infected with COVID, and we know from zero sampling and other ways that the likely number is more than twice that. We think that as many as half of Australia has contracted COVID just over the course of this year so far.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our focus right now is on getting through this wave. We have extended support to state hospital systems, we have massively expanded access to fourth dose vaccines and to antiviral treatments and we're encouraging Australians to be COVID-safe and, in particular, as the member points out, to wear masks when indoors and not able to socially distance.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member pointed out, and as the member for Higgins pointed out in her beautiful first speech this morning, we also need to come to grips with long COVID. As the member knows, long COVID is not easy to diagnose and it's not easy to treat. The medical literature already reports more than 200 different symptoms being logged, most commonly involving fatigue, shortness of breath and what people are now calling 'brain fog'. Some people's symptoms are disappearing after a few months; others, as the member points out, experience quite specific symptoms that require specific interventions—for example, from a cardiologist. But more and more Australians are suffering longer term multisystem disorders which prove very hard to diagnose and very hard to treat. The truth is we still don't really know the scale of this challenge. A common estimate of about four per cent of COVID patients experiencing long-term symptoms already runs to hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Australians. Support is available through standard Medicare systems. States are operating long COVID clinics, although their waiting lists are growing. But it's increasingly clear to me that we are going to need to develop a focused response nationally to the phenomenon of long COVID.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have already started work on the next phase of the government's pandemic response, particularly beyond this winter and this third omicron wave. I have already spoken to the Chief Medical Officer about the need to develop focused proposals around long COVID, in particular. It goes without saying that I'm very keen to continue further discussions with the member for Kooyong and other members of this place on this profound long-term health challenge that is proving so debilitating and so distressing for so many Australians.</span>

She, together with her other Hunter Valley colleagues, represents an area which has been crucial to Australia's energy generation and will continue to be so as we move Australia to become a renewable energy powerhouse. No region will be more important than the Hunter in that transformation. Getting more energy generation and more electricity generation is the centrepiece of the Albanese government's approach. We have Rewiring the Nation, which will ensure that we can transition to 82 per cent renewables in the system, because cheap energy is also clean energy. Unfortunately, the former government opposed, and continues to oppose, this investment in transmission.</span>

It is restricted to public affairs, administration and proceedings pending in the House. Then, of course, there's the well-understood requirement that an answer must be directly relevant to the question. It cannot be appropriate that there's a construct under which a minister is asked a question which invites them to reflect in the broadest possible terms on the conduct of the previous government. He should be telling the Australian people what the Albanese government's plans are to solve the problem. </span>

                  </a>  On the point of order: for the benefit of the Manager of Opposition Business, standing order 98, which he referred to at the start, carries the rules for the questions. They apply to the questioner. Standing order 104 is the one that refers to the answers, and that's the standing order that refers to the minister. It's not a valid point of order to use standing order 98 to try to limit what's in an answer. This question specifically included 'What are the consequences of a failure to act?' and the minister is being specifically relevant to it.</span>

I'll continue to listen to both questions and answers carefully and enforce the standing orders. Answers must be directly relevant and within the parameters of the question. The question was about consequences of a failure to act. If that part of the question was not in the question, the minister would not be relevant. I'll make a ruling if I feel the answer is not relevant and outside the parameters of the question. I call the minister, who was being relevant to one part of the question.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I understand the sensitivity of those opposite about the four un-fun facts of their record. The first un-fun fact is that in their time we had four gigawatts of energy generation leave the system and only one gigawatt of energy generation come on, because the previous government did not encourage renewable energy generation. We saw a 17 per cent decline in renewable energy generation over their period. Second, is that the previous minister announced a billion dollars of funding to get 3,800 megawatts onto the system and didn't deliver a gigawatt, a megawatt, a watt or an electron. Not one. Third, their signature policy, Snowy 2.0—we heard a lot about it. Good project. Did anybody in the House hear the minister come to the dispatch box before the election and announce it was running 18 months late? I might've missed it! Anyone? No. I don't think it came up. It wasn't mentioned. Finally, the result of their delay and denial was the dishonesty: the minister changing the law so he would not be held to account for his actions, citing an instrument to keep the facts from the Australian people. That's what the previous minister did. We are dealing with the implications of a Taylor-made crisis and we're fixing the mess we inherited.</span>

I refer the minister to her answer last week that 869 new nurses would be needed for Labor's 24/7 nurses in aged care policy. In April, when asked about the number of nurses needed to deliver 24/7 nursing, the now Minister for Home Affairs said, 'We will need to bring in low thousands, somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 new people.' Was the Minister for Home Affairs wrong, or did you, Minister, mislead the House?</span>

I think it was 1 April, off the top of my head, when these numbers were being discussed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's important to note here is that these numbers were the modelling of the then Morrison government when being told about workforce shortages. The difference is that we are actually doing something about it. We are doing something about workforce shortages. They were given a secret report that, on the theme of today, they chose not to tell people about. They were told the bad news and decided not to tell Australians anything about it but to try to skate through.</span>

                  </a>  So, yes, the number is still 869. It was also 869 when you didn't do anything about it, and it is thousands when we add the 200 care minutes, which is the other commitment that we speak about often. The thing to note when they ask us perplexedly where these workers are going to come from is that it is a problem that they chose to do nothing about. You had this problem for years and years and years. It's probably worth asking at this point, when we talk about aged-care workforce shortages, where it all stemmed from. It stemmed from December 2013, when one of the first actions of the Abbott government was to cut the aged-care workforce compact.</span>

                  </a>  I'll return to the question. When we talk about workforce shortages, this started in December 2013, when one of the very first acts of the Abbott government was to suspend standing orders in the House to cut the aged-care workforce compact, which was one of the first things that cut workers' rights and put us on this track. Who was the health minister at that very moment when standing orders were suspended? It was the now Leader of the Opposition. He is the one who was the health minister when they suspended standing orders to cut the aged-care workforce compact, which is one of the things that set us on this path to terrible workforce shortages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're upfront about this. It will require thousands of workers to come back online to fix the problem. That's why we're trying to give them a pay rise. We will need 869 nurses to meet our 24/7 nursing requirement. That is the question you asked me on Thursday. That is the question I answered. I think, Mr Speaker, you said, 'Want a different answer? Ask different question.' That was the number, broadly, as you well know from the secret report that you chose to do nothing about. Thousands of personal carers, thousands of kitchen staff and thousands of other staff in aged care are going to be required to get to what at the end of the day is talking about a better standard of care. They are quibbling over how we work to get a better standard of care and, really, after nine years of neglect, a better standard can't come soon enough. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Ms ROWLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:59</span>):  Mr Speaker, my deepest congratulations on your elevation. I thank the member for Makin for his question. As he—and, I think, every member of this House—knows, too many of our constituents have fallen victim to a scam text message or know someone who has. The perpetrators of scam texts are criminals who operate domestically and overseas. They utilise sophisticated technologies to harm innocent Australians whom they con into divulging sensitive information that can lead to their identity being stolen. They cause financial loss and emotional distress, and they ruin livelihoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC estimates that Australians lost more than $2 billion to scams last year. To give some perspective, according to Scamwatch, financial losses from scam texts have increased by a staggering 188 per cent compared to the same period last year, already costing Australians over $6½ million. This government considers this to be completely unacceptable, and, consistent with our priority to keep all Australians safe, it is pleasing that new rules recently came into force to help combat scam texts. For the first time, telco providers are required to identify, trace and block scam text messages. There are also enhanced obligations for educating consumers about scam texts. And if the telcos fail to comply with the new rules they face hefty penalties of up to a quarter of a million dollars. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can every scam text be stopped? Unfortunately, the reality is that scams will always exist, and consumers need to remain vigilant. But these measures offer better protection and deterrence than ever before, and there will be industry-wide consistency to implement and maintain first-rate capabilities to reduce scam texts. The evidence from scam call blocking shows that we can make a meaningful reduction in the volume of scam texts as well. In the first 16 months since the industry employed similar rules in relation to scam calls, over half a billion scam calls were blocked from reaching Australian consumers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the House and to Australians tuning in: if you receive a suspicious text which you think might be a scam, it probably is. Don't click on any link attached to it and don't provide any information in response to it. I encourage you to visit Scamwatch to report scams and to check out its useful tips on detecting and avoiding them. These developments reflect this government's broader suite of initiatives to help keep Australians safe from scams. We've committed to establishing a national anti-scam centre, which my colleague the Assistant Treasurer will be spearheading. This government is committed to disrupting the business models of scammers, and these latest regulatory improvements in relation to scam texts are an important step in that very sensitive mission.</span>

If you don't have a nurse in a nursing home, when an elderly person gets sick they can often end up getting an acute health condition because there isn't someone on site to help them. That's what the royal commission said. That's what we're responding to. </span>

                  </a>  Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. I'm asked a question about nurses in nursing homes, and what those opposite are saying is that it's not relevant—the consequences of not having a nurse in a nursing home 24/7. That's what they are saying. We had a very clear plan about nurses in nursing homes. We had a very clear plan about 215 minutes of care. We had a very clear plan about more accountability for the operators of nursing homes. We had a very clear plan about better nutrition in nursing homes for aged-care residents, because we know that, according to the royal commission, over half of aged-care residents were not getting the nutrition that they need. They're literally starving. This is the issue before Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the opposition: think seriously about the impact on those people watching this at home who have mum or dad or grandpa or grandma or their sister or brother in an aged-care home and are worried about the impact which is there, worried about the deficiencies that have been identified by the aged-care royal commission. And you know what they're saying around the country? They're saying, 'We want a nurse in a nursing home.' They're saying, 'We want 215 minutes of care.' They're saying, 'We want better nutrition.' They're saying they want better accountability. Those opposite just show, with this line of questioning, just how completely out of touch they are. </span>

The first thing I did when I got this job was go back to my old primary school and give my former teacher Mrs Fry a hug. It just seemed like the right place to start. Cathy Fry started at Cabramatta Public School in 1978, and she's still there, changing lives. And, although I see a lot of smiles across the chamber, we can all think of someone like that, can't we—somebody who shaped us, someone who changed us, someone who inspired us? There aren't many jobs in this country more important than being a teacher, and we need more of them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a shortage of teachers right across the country at the moment, and it's not just because of COVID; it's not just because of the flu; it's more than that. There are more kids going to school now than ever before, and that's a great thing, but there are fewer people going on to university to study teaching. We have seen a drop of about 16 per cent in the course of the last 10 years. We need to turn that around. That's why we've committed to providing bursaries worth up to $40,000 to encourage the best and brightest to become teachers. That's why we are expanding the high achiever teachers program, to encourage mid-career professionals to switch to the classroom. It is also why we're prioritising visas for overseas teachers to come and work here. Can I thank the Minister for Home Affairs, who initiated that. We have to do more than that because it is not just a shortage of people signing up to be teachers. More and more teachers are leaving the profession early, either because they feel burnt out, worn out, or for other reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are serious about fixing this, it requires the federal government and state and territory governments to work together. That's why next week when education ministers meet here in Canberra, we will focus on looking at ways that we can encourage more people to become teachers, how we can improve initial teacher education and how we can tackle some of those reasons that are causing teachers to leave the profession early. We won't do that on our own. I'm also inviting teachers, principals and other education experts to join us, to pick their brains, to get their ideas, to listen to them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important work. Education is the most powerful cause for good in this country. It changes lives, just like Cathy Fry has been changing lives for more than 40 years, and we want more Australians to help us do that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In moving this motion, I take this opportunity to provide the House with some guidance on the week ahead and where I think sittings are likely to be. I have provided most of this information to both the Manager of Opposition Business and to the crossbench. But just to be able to provide it generally, first of all, if this motion is carried, which I certainly hope it is, we will then go immediately into debate on the private member's bill, the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022. That is designated for two hours of debate. If we run out of speakers in those two hours, we will not go to a vote. The private member's bill will be referred to the Federation Chamber, and that will basically take up government business time for the Federation Chamber for the rest of the week.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a strong view, that has been held in this place for a long time, that for conscience vote issues every member who wants to speak should have the opportunity to do so. We may well get through the speakers this week in the Federation Chamber. If we do, it will come down here for a vote. But if we require more time when we come back for the next sitting fortnight, it will continue to be listed until we've got through all the speakers. If we run short on speakers today and we don't fill the two hours, as may occur, I would suggest then—although indulgence is completely within the realm of the Speaker—that further statements on indulgence following the death of Archie Roach might be an appropriate use of the chamber before we return to the address in reply where there are some further first speeches.</span>

I'm hoping to get both the Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Amendment (Selection and Appointment) Bill 2022 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022 across before question time. I suspect the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022 will be contentious but there is a time constraint on us for this which—</span>

So if it is to be abolished the Senate will need to deal with it in the following sitting fortnight. For those who follow closely the Senate agenda—which I haven't done previously in my life, but I'm doing now—they principally do their government business on a Monday. So I will be hoping to get that through tomorrow. I will be looking at the speaking list. If the speaking list is long, rather than gag the debate I will declare the bill urgent and we will have a vote as to whether or not that is the case. I remind people—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  Mr Speaker, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation. You have big shoes to fill, and I am certain that you will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I'd like to acknowledge at the outset that many individuals have written to me about the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022, on both sides of this. I'd also like to acknowledge the work of my colleagues Luke Gosling, the member for Solomon, and Alicia Payne, the member for Canberra, who have already spoken in this debate. I'd also like to acknowledge my territory colleagues that will follow me in this debate, not just here in the House of Representatives but hopefully in the Senate, particularly Senator Katy Gallagher. I wish to acknowledge my friends in the ACT Legislative Assembly that have raised this issue now for the last three to four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At its essence, this bill was about whether citizens living in the territories should have the same right, through their local legislatures, as citizens in the states to make their own laws. In my view, there can be no doubt the answer to that question is yes. The granting of self-government to Australia's two populous territories recognised that the people of the territories deserve the same democratic rights as people living in the states. As the then Minister for Arts and Territories, the Hon. Clyde Holding, put it in introducing the Australian Capital Territory (Self-government) Bill 1988:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill 1988, now before the House will establish the A.C.T. as a body politic, with the legislative and executive powers and responsibilities of the States and the Northern Territory. This Bill represents the most significant transfer of power, on a population basis, since Papua New Guinea became independent. It will allow 270,000 people the same democratic rights and social responsibilities as their fellow Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The A.C.T. and the City of Canberra have well and truly come of age. Canberra is the nation's capital. It is the home of many of the symbols of our nationhood—the National Gallery, the High Court, the National Library and of course this magnificent building—the home of the nation's Parliament. But, and this is often overlooked, it is also home for 270,000 people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">270,000 people live in the Australian Capital Territory. They go about the day-to-day business of their lives, working at their jobs, paying their taxes, making decisions about which schools their children will go to, which doctor or hospital will care for them when they are ill—just like every other Australian. However, unlike every other person in this country—where 'a fair go' is the creed by which we live—they cannot elect a member of their own community to their own government. They have no say in the decisions which affect their everyday lives. What an extraordinary admission in a country so committed to democratic ideals, and why? Are these people somehow different from other Australians? Are they second-class citizens in some way? Do they not understand, or have opinions on, the issues that confront them daily? Can they not be trusted with their own destiny? The answer to all these questions is very simple—the only difference between these people and the rest of Australia is that they live in the Australian Capital Territory!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All that is as true today as it was in 1988, except that there are now over 450,000 people living in the ACT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted that there exists a greater democratic deficit for Australian citizens living in our external territories—Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Citizens in these territories have a limited form of local government. Norfolk Island are currently in administration, but they have no democratic input into critical areas such as health and education and rely on federal representation more than 1,000 kilometres away. If this is to be a parliament that truly cares about territory rights then it needs to also turn its mind to providing a better voice for our less populous territories as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the ACT Legislative Assembly was established, there were exceptions to the powers of the legislative assembly, but these reflected for the most part either limitations that the Constitution itself placed on the states or matters that the states had agreed should be dealt with by the Commonwealth. For example, the ACT Legislative Assembly was not to have the power to make laws with regard to the raising or maintaining of any naval, military or air force or with regard to the coining of money, despite being home to the Royal Australian Mint. Similarly, the act excluded the power to make laws with respect to the classification of materials for the purposes of censorship, which was already the subject of a national scheme under which classification was the responsibility of the Commonwealth. In each case, commonsense dictated that these matters should be solely in the domain of the parliament of Australia. In effect, the ACT was not being placed in a position any different to that of the states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That leaves two further original exceptions: the acquisition of property other than on just terms and the provision by the AFP of police services in relation to the territory. The first of these was based on a limitation imposed on parliament by the Constitution, while the second reflected the fact that the AFP are under the direction of the Commonwealth minister and policing services in the ACT are the subject of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the territory. That bill was passed with bipartisan support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there was some discussion around the detail, the record is clear that, across the political spectrum, there was agreement that the lawmaking powers of the ACT Legislative Assembly and the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly should be equivalent to those of a state parliament. This remained the case until the passage of the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997, which removed from the ACT Legislative Assembly and the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly the power to make laws with respect to euthanasia or voluntary assisted dying. In doing so, that act introduced discrimination in that it remained completely open to any state parliament to pass such laws. The bill before us supports restoring the constitutional position that existed from the time self-government was introduced into each of the territories until the passage of the Euthanasia Laws Act. It will be a matter for each of the territories to decide whether and in what form any laws should be passed in this area, just as it is and always has been for each of the states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are some who may object that the ACT and the Northern Territory are not states and that their legislatures should not have the same powers as state parliaments. Of course it's true that self-government exists only because of acts of this parliament, not by way of constitutional right, and it is within the power of this parliament to amend the self-government acts if it sees fit. However, parliament, having made its decision on the general principle that self-government ought to be granted to the people of the ACT and Northern Territory, would be wrong to pick and choose matters for which we would deny citizens in the territories the rights to govern themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of us may be unhappy with the decisions made by the people of the territories, but, if we support the principle of self-determination, we accept their decisions and do not seek to substitute our own any more than we would where the same decision was made by a parliament of the state. Former Senator Humphries said in 2006, when he crossed the floor to oppose the Howard government's disallowance of the ACT's Civil Unions Act:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we may not agree with the ACT's legislative choices, but we have an obligation to respect them where they are democratically made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that the legislation on euthanasia or voluntary assisted dying is an issue that provokes strong passions, with firmly held opinions from opposing points of view. That's understandable since the issues relate to matters of life and death and pain and suffering and because we have a critical role to ensure we protect the vulnerable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between the time that I spoke on these matters in the Senate, two parliaments ago, in the Federation Chamber in the last parliament and now, both of my parents died, and in both cases I was entrusted to be their power of attorney. While I did not have to make any decisions in relation to my father, I did in relation to my mother and I was able to do so in accordance with her wishes and with access to palliative care. That decision made four weeks ago weighs heavily on my shoulders. Not everyone gets access to palliative care in their last days or decent and respectful care in their later years. Addressing these challenges should be a priority for all Australian governments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My own personal view is not in support of legalisation of euthanasia. However, with all its gravity, this is not something that should be restricted from consideration by the ACT and Northern Territory legislative assemblies.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  In 2016, Canberra man Nebojsa Pavkovic died on his 61st birthday. He was at the end of a five-week hunger strike inside a body which he knew was no longer working. Mr Pavkovic had been suffering from Parkinson's disease for a decade and had come to the decision, speaking with his family, that he wanted to end his life. He was, however, unable to do so through voluntary assisted dying and had to do so through the much more traumatic and painful approach of a five-week hunger strike. As daughter Katarina Knowles said, 'He was really, truly bedridden, and it was just the worst.' I spoke to Katarina a year ago, when I was moving a private member's motion in this place to repeal the Andrews ban to finally allow the ACT and the Northern Territory to have the same rights as the states to legislate over voluntary assisted dying. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now in a situation in which this parliament is lagging behind the broader community. Surveys in the 1980s suggested that public support for doctor-led voluntary assisted dying was somewhere in the high sixties, in the 1990s, when the Andrews ban was passed, it was in the mid- to high seventies, and in the past two decades support has been in the eighties, and yet it has not been possible for those in the territories to have the same debate over voluntary assisted dying as those in the states. They have been prevented from doing so by an anachronistic ban put in place 25 years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to remember the state of the world back then. That was a stage in which the Northern Territory had been first in the world in introducing voluntary assisted dying laws and there was a concern that people from the states might go to the Northern Territory in order to use those laws. So the Andrews ban overturned the right to the Northern Territory and in so doing the ACT became collateral damage. The ACT hadn't legislated at that time, but the Andrews ban swept up the ACT just because it could.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, as those who argued for the Andrews ban put it, the ban was put in place because the territories had moved before the states. Frank Brennan asked the rhetorical question in a submission, 'Should the Commonwealth parliament overturn a territory law?' He answered his own question as follows: 'Only in very rare circumstances where no state has similarly legislated.' We are not now in a situation where no state has similarly legislated. We are in a situation in which every state has similarly legislated. So to hold back the territories is to hold back two jurisdictions from putting in place the very same laws that are in place in every state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that just a short drive from this parliament is New South Wales, a place which has enabled voluntary assisted dying. And so the argument has been turned on its head. While the concern might otherwise be that people would travel to the Northern Territory in the mid-nineties to take advantage of those laws, now it is the concern that while the vast majority of Australia has legislated for voluntary assisted dying the territories are carved out. People in the territories who wanted to choose the circumstances of ending their own lives would need to travel now to a state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned before the strong community support for voluntary assisted dying. I want to take the House to a few statistics that illustrate quite how strong that support is. According to Vote Compass voluntary assisted dying is now supported by 87 per cent of Australians, 79 per cent of coalition voters, 77 per cent of Catholics, 78 per cent of Protestants. We now have a situation in which many European countries, many states in the United States and the District of Columbia have legalised voluntary assisted dying. It is also the case that the territory legislatures have grown up. The ACT was an eight-year-old parliament when the Andrews ban took effect. It's now in its 30s and is a debating chamber the equal of any state parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the advocacy work of Andrew Denton from Go Gentle; Andrew Barr and Tara Cheyne from the ACT, who were here in the House this morning to hear the members for Solomon and Canberra introduce this private member's bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise the members for Bean and Lingiari who support this private member's bill and Senators McCarthy and Gallagher in the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note that while Labor territory representatives are united in our support for this bill, around half of those that I've named do not themselves support voluntary assisted dying. They are standing on the principle of territory rights, recognising that they want those parliaments to be able to have the debate, but making the case that in the end they hope those territory assemblies do not go ahead and enact voluntary assisted dying. And so I hope those in this parliament who themselves have personal misgivings about voluntary assisted dying will nonetheless vote for this bill on the basis of territory rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been pleased to have a range of conversations with those on both sides of the House and on the crossbench about this important bill. In many of those conversations I have noted the commitment to territory rights. I know that many coalition members who are listening to this debate also have misgivings about voluntary assisted dying. Many of them, if they were in state parliaments, would have voted against the legalisation of voluntary assisted dying that has now gone through all of the state parliaments, but the coalition has a strong commitment to federalism. As others have put it, if you want to be in the fight against voluntary assisted dying, run for a territory parliament, because that's where the debate should take place—in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and on the floor of the ACT Legislative Assembly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should no longer be the place of this House to hold back the territories from doing what every single state has done. The Andrews ban was wrong in 1997, but it is utterly ridiculous today for that ban to stay in place. I draw coalition members' attention to the words of then Liberal Chief Minister of the ACT, Kate Carnell. She argued in 1987 against the Andrews ban, saying that it was 'limiting our self-governing powers' and that 'what is at issue here is nothing less than the democratic rights of the citizens of the ACT'. That principle is one that has been shared by former senator Gary Humphries and by Marshall Perron in the Northern Territory. There is nothing about restoring territories' rights that is inherently a Labor value. It should be supported by those in the coalition too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me this has been a long process. In the 45th Parliament I moved a bill to repeal the Andrews ban. In the 46th Parliament I moved a private member's motion to remove the Andrews ban. In neither case did the then government bring that debate to the floor. It is to the credit of the Albanese Labor government that this debate has been brought to the floor. I do note that, when the Andrews ban was debated in this place 25 years ago, the Prime Minister was one of those who personally spoke out against the Andrews ban. Prime Minister Albanese has been extraordinarily consistent in his support for territory rights, in his recognition that voluntary assisted dying is appropriately an issue to be debated by territory parliaments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People may well differ on the question of euthanasia and voluntary assisted dying, but they ought to be united on territory rights. I acknowledge the hard work of Senator Leyonhjelm in a previous parliament in trying to get this through the Senate and that vote came down to just a few votes in the Senate. This time I hope the vote in the Senate will be much stronger, much more overwhelming. When it happens the sky won't fall in. The territories will debate voluntary assisted dying. They may choose to follow the states or they may not, but it's appropriate that those legislatures have that debate. It's appropriate that a conversation about an issue that enjoys the support of nearly nine out of 10 Australians should be debated in the territories, as it was in the states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to any members of the House who are currently unsure of their position on a conscience vote: we don't have conscience votes in this place very often. My door is open. If you want to speak about these issues, I would love the opportunity to engage you in that conversation. I would love the opportunity to make the case that so many of my constituents in the electorate of Fenner have made to me—that they should not be second-class democratic citizens; that they should have the very same rights over this issue that people in states currently enjoy. So come and knock on my door. Come and knock on the door of the members for Bean, Lingiari, Solomon or Canberra. We'd be pleased to speak to you about this issue. We respect the diversity of views on the question of voluntary assisted dying but we call for your support for the fundamental democratic principle of territory rights. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  The Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022 is probably one of the more difficult bills that many of us will have to face. I have been given many notes from both sides of the debate on this. They are all well-meaning and all make very valid points. The AMA has reservations about euthanasia, faith leaders have got their reservations, as have many of my constituents. However, that's also balanced by quite a few people who have absolutely no question in their minds about the rights of people to choose to go down that path. Having personally witnessed four to five people slowly dwindle away to diseases such as cancer, I must admit that it's a real conundrum for me as well. In fact, before we came to the first week of parliament, last Sunday I visited a party member who was passing, and he subsequently passed away on the Tuesday. I was able to witness firsthand very recently how awful it is when someone is taken in that slow manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill is not about whether euthanasia is right or wrong; it's about restoring the rights to territories to make decisions on this. My only concern there—well, I have a couple of concerns, but one of them is that I just don't believe the territories have the levers and the systems; they're not set up. In other words, they don't have a Senate to debate this properly and handle issues like this. We have those powers federally, and I think that the federal government needs to deal with it here, in this House, and not pass it on to the territories. I suspect, and I hope that I'm not right, that they are passing it over so that they don't have to really confront this tough issue. I hope they're doing it for the right reasons, but I don't know what their motives are. We can deal with it here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also against it because I am one of those people who would like to see the powers of the states and the territories reduced. I think one thing that the pandemic showed us for sure was that Australians have had a gutful of living in what they called eight countries, with closed borders and different rules in every state when it came to who could go to work, who couldn't go to work, who they could see or who they couldn't see. We had people from Queensland trying to go to work in New South Wales and come back, but they couldn't because they had to quarantine. Yet on their passports they had one common thing, which is that they are all Australian citizens. I might reside in Queensland, but I am an Australian citizen. As such, I and many other Queenslanders and Australians believe we should be able to move within our country and our borders as we see fit. They wanted the federal government to lead when it came to mandates on the pandemic, and we were actually constrained by the Constitution. So I am against anything that gives states and territories more powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have a good conversation about the Constitution in this country, and we need to change a few things so that the federal government can take its rightful place and lead when it comes to matters of national crisis and matters of conscience such as euthanasia and other matters, and not hand it to the states. We are supposed to be the highest level of government in this country, and the Constitution prevents us from fulfilling that obligation to the people of this country. So I say: don't support giving the rights back to the territories. Deal with it here federally. Let's ante up. Let's behave like we are supposed to and deal with the big issues and not pass it off to the smaller and lower forms of government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I rise today to support the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022. This is the first bill I have risen to support in this place, and as a representative of a Northern Territory electorate, I am pleased that it is about supporting territory rights. I am a Territorian born and bred, and I well remember the shock that we felt when the federal government overturned a duly enacted territory statute, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. Even those who did not support that particular piece of legislation were outraged that politicians representing electorates far from the Territory could meet in Canberra and decide to squash a Territory law without the consent of those for whom the law was enacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Commonwealth parliament passed the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act in 1978, the particular cohort of federal parliamentarians who made up the parliament at the time had the wisdom and empathy to grant to Territorians the power to elect their own politicians. Those Territory politicians would then be authorised to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Northern Territory. The words 'peace, order and good government' make up a standard phrase in constitutional drafting which predates Federation and goes back to the constitutions of some of the pre-existing colonies. They formalise the purpose and scope of what legislators are expected to do. The subject matter of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act was naturally and self-evidently within the ambit of peace, order and good government for a governed area and population, and, on that basis, equivalent laws relating to voluntary assisted dying have, in the more recent past, been enacted by state legislators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is absolutely no reason why the Territory should be different from any state in this respect, or indeed in regard to any law which could be properly characterised as being for the peace, order and good government of the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory deserves the right to legislate on issues that affect it, just like the states do. There is no defensible rationale for condemning people who live in the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory, which share similar self-government arrangements, to being second-class Australian citizens when it comes to their collective capacity to make laws for themselves in the constitutional space which in other parts of Australia is occupied and actively engaged in by state governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has a history, and in many respects an unmeritorious history, of intervening in the Northern Territory and of imposing ideologically driven policies from Canberra. Those who live in the Territory object to that approach. You need to understand the Territory to create effective policies for the Territory. That is what lies at the heart of this debate. On the issue of voluntary assisted dying, Territorians should be able to have their views and voices heard and acted upon. The Northern Territory's legislative assembly comprises politicians elected by Northern Territory electorates, and it is their job to reflect the views of their constituents in the legislative assembly. It is no part of the job of a federal parliamentarian whose seat is in some other part of Australia to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a very simple one. In terms of the Northern Territory, it simply repeals one section, section 50A, of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act. That section was inserted by the federal government's Euthanasia Law Act 1997. It was a section that prevented the Territory from enacting laws regarding voluntary assisted dying and made the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act inoperative. However—and, in my view, importantly—this bill also ensures that the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 is not automatically reinstated. This bill would not make voluntary assisted dying legal, and indeed it shouldn't. Territorians must have the opportunity to debate any euthanasia proposal that might be forthcoming. It is a contentious issue, felt very deeply on both sides. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If proposals are made by the Northern Territory parliamentarians to introduce legislation regarding voluntary assisted dying, I will be calling for a comprehensive and in-depth education campaign. People 25 years old today were newborns when this legislation was passed in the Northern Territory parliament. No-one under the age of 40 has had a chance to learn about the issues, participate in debate or tell their elected representatives what they think. Our Northern Territory society has become much more multicultural since then. We have many more people with different religions or spiritual backgrounds who were not part of that debate the last time. And people out bush, Indigenous people, need the information and the time to become well informed about what voluntary assisted dying means. The reality is that many people on remote communities and outstations do not trust the system. They do not trust the messages that come from the broader society and they are scared about what the implications and consequences of government-sanctioned euthanasia might be. We saw this mistrust with COVID, where many people out bush believed it was a disease to be imposed on them. I saw it with euthanasia in the late nineties, when I was working in the community health sector and saw how the issue impacted Aboriginal people's willingness to come into the health clinics. We cannot allow this to happen if we have another debate. So I am pleased that this bill does not seek to automatically legalise euthanasia in the Northern Territory, and I am absolutely delighted that it restores the power of the territories to make their own laws relating to voluntary assisted dying. I support the passing of this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  Deputy Speaker Claydon, like many of my parliamentary colleagues, I congratulate you on your recent elevation to high office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to object to the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022, and I will give my reasons why. But, before I do that, I want to recognise and acknowledge that this is a conscience bill. This is a bill where reasonable minds will differ. This is the first time I've had an opportunity to speak in this place since my demise as Speaker, and a time like this is very important. It makes you recognise and better understand how important it is to be able to speak on matters such as this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first thing I want to say is that I implore all members and senators to conduct themselves in a respectful manner in a debate such as this, as I am sure they will do—and I congratulate them on doing so so far. This bill has a fairly innocuous title. In some respects, it is somewhat misleading. The name of the bill relates to restoring the territories' rights effectively to be able to govern themselves. At first blush, that would be difficult to argue against. I accept that. But it's more than that. It is much more than that. Basically it gives the territories the right to determine euthanasia, voluntary assisted dying, and that is the point I rally against. I openly admit that there are many people in Australia who have a different view on this. I accept that. Maybe even many on my own side of the chamber have a different view. But that's the beauty of the democracy in which we live, and it's the beauty of the ability to speak freely on these sorts of conscience votes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe in the sanctity of life. I believe that states should only in the most exceptional of circumstances approve of the killing of a human being—in instances like war or self-defence, to name two. I'm making a lot of concessions here, and one of the concessions is that I've never been in a situation where I've had to watch my mum or my dad die a painful death. I accept readily that I am coming to this view with, some might say, a fairly innocent approach. But belief is belief, and I would like to think that, even if I were faced with that situation, my belief would not change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go into the merits of the bill, I want to say that I understand that the issue of voluntary assisted dying, or euthanasia, is very much a polarising one. Statistics have already been raised by members of this House that there's support in the order of 80 per cent for voluntary assisted dying. It's clear that voluntary assisted dying in some form or shape has been enacted in all of the states in this country. That is true, but that doesn't make it right. Some people would say, 'You're an elected representative in the federal parliament; you should mirror the views of your constituents and the country.' There is some truth to that, but that is not an absolute. There are some times when we as elected representatives feel so strongly about something that many of us will draw a line in the sand and say: 'No, I'm sorry. I'm not prepared to go past that point.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us who were in the chamber several years ago will remember when the marriage equality bill came up. I made a commitment to the people in my electorate that I would support marriage equality based on the will of the Australian people, and I did. I honoured that commitment. But we're talking about the lives of Australians. We're talking about the sanctity of life, which is, in my view, absolutely more paramount than me being a federally elected member of parliament. My conscience does not permit me to vote for this bill. Some members will say that this bill doesn't legalise euthanasia. I accept that axiomatically this bill does not automatically mean that euthanasia in the territories will be legal. There would be a process that would have to be gone through in the territories' legislatures. I accept that. But I don't want to be one of those people that effectively authorise that to happen. On that basis, I oppose the passing of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise once again the member for Solomon and the member for Canberra, who kicked off this debate earlier this morning. But on the justification for the passing of this bill as referred to by the member for Solomon—I like the member for Solomon; I think he is a good, decent bloke—on this occasion I think he's been misled, because he started off by saying that this bill is not about euthanasia. But that's exactly what it is about. The member for Canberra, who followed him immediately afterwards, confirmed that—that this bill is absolutely about providing an entitlement for the territories to make laws in relation to euthanasia or voluntary assisted dying. I don't say that as a criticism of the member for Solomon. As I said, I think he is a good and decent man. But I do believe that he's wrong when he says that this is not about voluntary assisted dying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What those proponents of this bill fail to recognise—they talk about the importance of territory parliaments having some form of similar arrangement to the states. At first blush, that seems like a reasonable proposition, but I would suggest that it is constitutionally incorrect. Section 122 of the Constitution provides for this parliament, the Commonwealth parliament, to effectively have plenary powers over the territories. That is inescapable. Unlike state parliaments, this parliament has the power to pass laws in relation to the territories. The territories are a creature of the Commonwealth parliament. The Commonwealth has admittedly enacted self-government acts for the Northern Territory, for the ACT and also for Norfolk Island. Each of them has their own respective self-government provisions in their acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give some background for anybody who may be listening to this: on 25 May 1995, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly passed the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of 1995. On 9 September 1996, Kevin Andrews, the then member for Menzies, introduced the Euthanasia Laws Bill. The purpose of the bill was to provide that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, and the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly did not have the power to make laws which would permit that form of intentional killing of another that is called euthanasia or the assisting of another person to terminate his or her own life. The bill passed with amendments following a conscience vote in the House of Representatives on 9 December 1996. It passed the Senate in March 1997. The passing of Kevin Andrews's bill certainly overrode the Northern Territory's right to introduce laws to provide for euthanasia. In my view, it was the right thing to do then because it protects the sanctity of life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this chamber will never get an opportunity to pass laws in relation to voluntary assisted dying in any of the six states. For those in this chamber who believe in the sanctity of life, who believe that our most vulnerable should be protected, this is an opportunity to defend that right, to defend that sanctity of life, because if we give that up today, this week or for however long this debate takes, it's gone forever. I believe, as a community, as a society and as a country, we should be putting more money into things like palliative care to ease the suffering of people who are suffering and who are going to die. But there's a difference between providing palliative care and taking an active role in actually killing someone. I know that this is not just an issue which is open for debate amongst people of faith; this is also an issue which is actively debated by some members within the medical profession who take an oath, the Hippocratic oath—to first do no harm, to look after people. The concept of taking the life of a patient is anathema to many of those medical professionals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I encourage respectful debate. I'm sure that that's what will happen, as often happens on these conscience debates. That's as it should be. I respect that this is an issue where fair minds will differ, but this is an opportunity for this parliament, the federal parliament, to stamp its authority and respect the sanctity of life. We won't get many opportunities. This is a very, very important day today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, contrary to what the member for Solomon was saying earlier, is really about euthanasia and allowing the territories to legalise it. If this bill were a referendum bill to change territories—the ACT and the Northern Territory—to states, then I might support that. But the reality is that the territories are not the same as the states, and the Constitution sets it up that way. It's very clear. All the states have 12 senators in the other place. Tasmania, with 400,000 or 500,000 people, almost the same population as Canberra, have 12 senators. And the ACT get two senators because they're not a state; they're a territory. It's the same with the Northern Territory. They get two senators as well. If you want to become a state, then become a state, but this is really about legalising euthanasia through the back door and parliamentarians in this place trying to override what was done or the current parliament not debating it and putting that in place.</span>

In light of these provisions, together with public comments that the proposed legislation is <span style="font-style:italic;">exclusively </span>directed at enabling euthanasia/voluntary assisted dying to be enacted in the Territories, it is evident that the Federal Parliament is being asked to take responsibility precisely for legislation enabling the administration of lethal drugs to patients. This is quite a different proposition to the Acts of State Parliaments with similar intent. Through this legislation, the Commonwealth is being asked for the first time to sanction the killing of its most vulnerable citizens in jurisdictions where, Constitutionally, it has direct responsibility.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">3. The ACT (Seat of Government) is prevented from establishing its own police force or developing legislation around censorship, yet these are not presented as limitations on democracy in the manner in which provision to legislate to sanction the killing of its own citizens is frequently publicly presented.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a member of the Federal Parliament you have responsibilities for the citizens of your own electorates, States or Territories, but you also have wider responsibilities to work for the common good and the dignity of persons beyond any local dimensions. In exercising a conscience vote as a parliamentarian, you are called on to consider the deepest dimensions of your own humanity and to act in a manner consistent with the good of all Australian citizens.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, there is considerable irony that this call has a high degree of traction while the plight of many vulnerable Australians including First Nations people, those who are living with disability or who are aged may be offered this option but not consistently high quality care.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is the Territory's fiscal imbalance is at the core of arguments against this. The Northern Territory simply can't raise the funds required to cover its spending responsibilities. The Northern Territory accounts for about a sixth of Australia's total landmass, yet its population is around one-twentieth of Sydney's. What this means is that, if the Northern Territory receives the bulk of its funding from the Commonwealth, it's only fair that the Commonwealth retains some influence over Territory decision-making. I believe that this bill is not about the Territory wanting more territory rights, so to speak, but purely about enacting euthanasia through the territories, which is not their responsibility. It rests with the Commonwealth parliament, as we have the opportunity to pass laws in relation to territories. So I will be voting no.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  In March of last year voluntary assisted dying legislation passed both houses of the Tasmanian parliament. Tasmania became the third state in Australia at that time to legislate voluntary assisted dying. It was the fourth time assisted dying laws had come before the Tasmanian parliament since 2009. After a number of years of advocacy from Independent legislative councillor Mike Gaffney, who put forward the bill, and months of careful consultation with the community from MPs and MLCs on all sides, all members had a conscience vote and the bill passed the Tasmanian Legislative Council unanimously, with MPs in the lower house voting 16 to six in favour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with all social issues, the issue of voluntary assisted dying is contentious. But, regardless of how an individual may feel on the issue, the fact that the issue could be considered by Tasmanian parliamentarians is a right that our fellow citizens in the Northern Territory and the ACT are denied. To deny a territory the ability to make a decision on such a critical issue and one deemed important by many in their communities, no matter which side of the argument they fall on, is to deny the right of each and every citizen to participate in what is a democratic process simply because of where they live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how do we find ourselves here, having this very debate? Over 25 years ago, the Northern Territory were leading the world with their groundbreaking laws on medically assisted dying. On 25 May 1995, the then Chief Minister, Marshall Perron, introduced the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, allowing for someone in their last months of life to apply for a medically assisted death. The law came into effect on 1 July 1996. Still, the road for those seeking to put the law into practice was not easy. Taxi driver Max Bell, who was suffering from stomach cancer, became well known for driving 3,000 kilometres from Broken Hill to Darwin to use the Territory's euthanasia law. He was unable to carry out his wishes after medical and psychiatric professionals in the Northern Territory refused to provide the required information necessary as part of the process, and he eventually returned to Broken Hill. Bell eventually succumbed to stomach cancer, and the media coverage of his case sparked greater cooperation from medical professionals and paved the way for a 66-year-old carpenter, Bob Dent, who was suffering from prostate cancer, to become the first person in the world to take his own life under legally sanctioned voluntary euthanasia laws. For Bob's wife, Judy, there was comfort in Bob leaving the world on his own terms after she had watched him battle his terminal illness. She said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The worst thing about looking after somebody who is very ill and in pain is that you can't do anything about it …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would have taken some of his pain for him if I could have, but I was even afraid to hug him.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Naturally I didn't want him to die but I didn't want him to live the way he was having to live …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just nine months later, the former member for Menzies, Kevin Andrews, introduced a private member's bill successfully overturning the Northern Territory law while also amending legislation to prevent the Territory reintroducing it. The bill was supported across political lines, including by the now member for Watson, then director of the Euthanasia No! group. Dent was one of only four Territorians who were able to undertake voluntary euthanasia before the law was overturned. Judy, like so many Territorians, saw the federal government intervention as treating them like second-class citizens. Indeed, by overturning the law, it's hard to argue that the message is that democratically elected legislators of the territories cannot be trusted to make laws responsibly and appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't stand here and seek to criticise either the former member for Menzies or the current member for Watson, or anyone in this House, for their views on euthanasia. It is a deeply complex and sometimes deeply personal and sensitive issue that holds many shades of grey. However, I agree with the member for Solomon that, although this legislation should be about the sole issue that territory rights should be the same as the rights of people living in every state across Australia, for many this issue is tied to that of euthanasia. However, it is also the job of an elected representative to consult and advocate and ultimately vote on issues in line with community expectations. And the point that must be made is that the majority of us making a decision on this legislation do not represent these communities and, as such, should not have the power to stop the territories making a decision that's right for their own community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've come a long way as a society since the Northern Territory laws were first enacted in 1996. The act caused an uproar nationally and internationally, from politicians to healthcare professionals, religious groups, pro-life and pro-choice pressure groups, academics, the media and members of the general public. But, as pointed out by Go Gentle Australia, surveys show that around 85 per cent of Australians support the legislation of voluntary assisted dying to allow for a better choice at the end of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned previously, in Tasmania the End of Life Choices (Voluntary Assisted Dying) Bill passed last year—the fourth attempt at passing such a law after previous efforts in 2009, 2013 and 2017 failed. Each and every attempt saw passionate advocacy from both sides of the issue, but, year after year, community expectations have changed. And, thanks to the tireless work of Independent MLC Mike Gaffney, Tasmania now has laws that, by and large, meet the community's expectations. As pointed out by Mr Gaffney, the end result is a good indication of how parliament should work. The legislation will allow people who are suffering from advanced, incurable and irreversible conditions, which are expected to cause their death within six months, to end their own lives. The law will come into effect in October and, I hope, will bring relief and peace for those who may seek to exercise this right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should it pass, the proposed legislation before us today rightly gives the territories back their democratic powers, which were taken from them 25 years ago, allowing them to consider the issue of voluntary assisted dying in their respective jurisdictions. While not reinstating the Northern Territory euthanasia laws that were previously in force, this bill, at its core, allows territory parliaments and their communities to decide what is right for them, just as Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia have the legislative powers to do. I note that the Northern Territory Attorney-General has stated that their current voluntary dying legislation does need to be rewritten and modernised to meet best-practice standards. Every elected representative, whether local, state or federal, is elected to represent the views and wishes of their community on a whole range of issues, and to be denied the opportunity to carry out that role on such a significant issue is, in my view, undemocratic and inequitable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Efforts to overturn the 1997 federal government legislation have failed twice in recent years. A 2018 bill introduced in the Senate by former senator David Leyonhjelm saw a number of senators on both sides vote against it. In 2021, former Northern Territory coalition senator Sam McMahon attempted to introduce a territory rights bill to restore euthanasia powers in the Northern Territory, but it did not come to a vote. So the time is now. With this legislation we have a chance to deliver to the territories what is rightly theirs. The Commonwealth must ensure those in the territories are not treated as second-class citizens, and it must step out of the way by handing these legislative powers back. Territorians deserve the right to the same self-determination as all other individuals across the country, and I wholeheartedly support this bill.</span>

I rise to pay tribute to the memory and the life of Uncle Archie Roach, and the family, as we know, has given permission for us to use his name and his image to preserve and continue his legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday night, there was a ripple around the Garma festival as the news spread about the passing of Archie Roach. Everywhere you were, there were sounds of wailing, crying, with people clinging to each other in grief. Archie Roach was born in 1956. He was my contemporary. A member of the stolen generation, Uncle Archie was just three years old when he was taken from his parents; that was in 1960. Archie's memory from that day was his father screaming, restrained by the police, while all but one child were loaded into a big black car. Archie Roach never saw his parents again. Later in life he wrote the wrote the song that we all know so well, 'Took the Children Away'. In that he wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Snatched from their mother's breast</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Said this is for the best</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was placed in a children's home and a series of foster homes until he finally found a family he could call home. He was seven years old.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Archie was 14 years when he received a letter about the death of his mother. Until that day, he didn't know he had a family. Shocked and angry, he ran away from home at 15, first to Sydney then to the streets of Adelaide and Melbourne, always searching for his family and his identity. But it was while he was in Adelaide that he met his soulmate, the remarkable Ruby Hunter. Both homeless at the time, they met at a Salvation Army drop-in centre called, of all things, The Peoples Palace. Uncle Archie said he always remembered the day he met Ruby. She was wearing a blue dress, and he always remembered that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Archie Roach was a pioneer of First Nations music, the voice of a generation. He was a singer, a poet and truth-teller. For many Australians his song, 'Took the Children Away', which he wrote in 1990, was their first exposure to the horrors of the stolen generations. His music shone a light on the truth of that policy. He always said his music was born of pain and trauma but driven by hope and healing. Paul Kelly said of Archie, 'big tree down, weeping in the forest.' Paul Kelly of course collaborated with Archie Roach in his first album, <span style="font-style:italic;">Charcoal Lane</span>. His early passing at 66 underscores the life expectancy gap for First Nations people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  on indulgence—I start, in paying tribute to Archie Roach, by extending my deepest sympathies to Archie's family, particularly his sons, Amos and Eban, and thank them for granting us permission to use Archie's name, to share Archie's images and to continue playing his music. They didn't have to do that and they certainly didn't have to do that immediately. In a very real way they've given us, the nation, permission in some way to grieve with them and there's a lot to grieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've thought about it and I don't think ever met a more humble person than Archie Roach. When we talk about his music living on, it's true that we can play the albums, right back to <span style="font-style:italic;">Charcoal Lane</span> or more recently <span style="font-style:italic;">Tell Me Why</span> and you can hear the voice. But what we won't get is that banter between songs that you'd get when you would see Archie Roach live. The first time I saw him live was in Wollongong at the ACTU Congress some years ago where he performed. The last time I saw him perform was at the Woodford Folk Festival. He was performing there with Paul Grabowsky. Together with Paul Grabowsky they reimagined all his early work. If anyone hasn't listened to the album <span style="font-style:italic;">Tell Me Why</span> please do, because in reimagining it they also wrote three new songs. They wanted to write a new song for each of the foster families that Archie had been with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a song that I heard for the first time at Woodford, because I hadn't bought the album at that stage—but I was listening to the vinyl yesterday. He told the story of one of the foster parents and them bringing him into the house once a week and wanting him to learn manners when having a cup of tea. In that image was both the generosity and the condescension all sort of wrapped up together. In telling it Archie just told it as a story of love and then sang the song with the chorus, 'One for each person and one for the pot'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of tributes are out there at the moment. The Minister for Indigenous Australians just referred to what has been said by Paul Kelly. I think perhaps the most powerful of the tributes that artists have put out there was the one I saw yesterday from Dan Sultan. Dan just looked down the camera and started playing the guitar and did not sing a word. As you listen you realise that you're hearing the guitar backing for 'Took the Children Away'. Without saying a word he reminded us that the music is there forever, but the voice, the power of that voice, is not with us in the same way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the power of that voice was the way Archie continued to lend it to others and to lend it to the next generation. His mentoring of Australian musicians was extraordinary and unbelievably generous. A lot of people will know the band AB Original—Briggs and Trials—and the album <span style="font-style:italic;">Reclaim Australia</span>. Even if you didn't listen to the whole album—for some people that album, both the music and for some the lyrics, will be a bit too much—just listen to the first track, because all the first track is an interview with Archie Roach, with the music playing behind and him, talking about activism and the need to act. <span style="font-style:italic;">Re</span><span style="font-style:italic;">claim Australia</span> by AB Original—you'll get it off your phone. Just listen to the first track and if the music keeps playing then we've done well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His generosity in continuing to act as a mentor to artists went right up until only a few weeks ago. I try to listen each week to Triple J's Like a Version and three weeks ago it was Archie Roach. He was there with Becca Hatch and Marlon x Rulla. He finished with a medley of Bob Marley hits, which means the final words I watched him sing while he was alive were: 'Get up, stand up, stand up for your right. Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight.' It's important that we don't. We're all in a better position to be able to do all of that together, because we've been blessed with the life of Archie Roach. </span>

Thank you to my constituents in Melbourne's west. Representing you in this place is the greatest honour of my life, and I'll continue to work hard each and every day to try and live up to it, and to build a better future for you and your families. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, too, to the Labor activists who helped us win the campaign in Gellibrand in this election. I've never taken the support of my constituents for granted, and we campaign hard every election to return a Labor member to this House.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hundreds of volunteers contributed to our campaign, and I am thankful to each and every one of them. A few special thanks, though. To the indefatigable Alison, thank you for your enormous contribution nearly every day of pre-poll and on polling day and for filling in on all of the roster shifts when someone wasn't available, which in COVID times was not a few times. Bill, thank you for covering the Truganina pre-poll and for making the commute all the way from Altona—past the Altona pre-poll—to get there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to Terry, Gary, Matt, Mita, Brenda, Greg, Gavin, Effie, Janet, Trish and Dean for putting in hundreds of hours into the campaign, collectively. Thank you to all of those who joined me in pre-poll: Linelle, Janet, Marcelle, Joan, Eerik, Michael, Catherine, Pritam, William, Paul, Karen, Scott, John, Julie, Clovis, Martine, Louise and Liam—thank you all. Campaigning is hard, and campaigning during Melbourne's winter is even harder still, so thank you for braving the cold and the mud of the Altona Finnish Society, the windswept car parks of Truganina and the bustle of Point Cook town centre. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to all the polling day booth captains: Kemal, Chris, Caelan, Gary, Matthew, Monica, Jock, Brenda, Cornelius, Trish, Paddy, Ann, Lance, Stan, Bill, Alison, Mat, Effie, Jebesh, Scott, Robin, Nathan, Brett, Kate, Eloise, Cindy, Oliver and Sienna. Thank you to all of the scrutineers, who stayed behind after what was already a long day—though I suspect arriving just in time to hear the election results from Western Australia probably made it worthwhile. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you lastly to my staff: Finn, Sienna, Henry, Steve, Andrew, Walt and Kieran. It's been a hard term. Thank you. I couldn't have survived it without you. Thank you also to all of my staff who've worked with me during nine long years of opposition but weren't working in my office in time to see the promised land. There have been a lot of people, but thank you in particular to the long termers: Raymond, Lara, Heather, Cesar, Diane, Ben and Fiona. You're all true believers who made a big contribution to this government along the way. Finally, thank you to Clara Jordan-Baird. I know how much you would have loved the last couple of months, and I've been missing you particularly as a result. We'll hold your memory close as we begin delivering on the causes that you worked so hard for in your life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Albanese Labor government we aren't wasting a moment. The election came at a critical time in our nation's history, when the challenges facing our nation have been growing more rapidly than ever before. Australia was adrift under the previous government. We saw nine years of economic policy stagnation, nine years of climate change inaction, nine years of neglect bordering on sabotage of the levers of our influence around the world. It was a decade of drift. After nine years those opposite left Australia with $1 trillion in liberal debt and far too little to show for it, and no plan for the future. I am proud to be a member of the Albanese Labor government, that doesn't only have a plan for a better future but hasn't missed a moment in getting to work on it. We've already secured an increase in the minimum wage. We promised it; we delivered it. We've introduced legislation to enshrine our climate change commitments into law, to fix the aged-care crisis and to create universal paid leave for family and domestic violence, a cause that members on this side of the House have been campaigning for for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the problems left to us by the previous government can't be fixed overnight, but we're getting on with the job. There's been a bit of a dynamic across the government as new ministers settle into their new roles, get behind the desks and look down into the bottom drawer. Again and again, my colleagues are finding that those opposite simply gave up on governing long before the last election. Whether it's visas, share registers or healthcare funding, they were in power but they were checked out, obsessed with their own internal conflicts and culture wars instead of the job that Australians elected them to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own position, I'm deeply grateful that the Prime Minister has chosen to appoint me as the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs. After I was sworn in, I looked in my in-tray and saw for myself the mess left behind by the previous government in the Australian Passport Office—an issue that will be familiar to every member in this House. A massive backlog of passport applications exists, many delayed by weeks. Phones are jammed with Australian seeking an update. Queues are wrapped around whole city blocks, full of Australians anxious about their family reunions and long-awaited international holidays being wrecked by the previous government's mismanagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two million Australians allowed their passports to expire during the pandemic without renewing them. Yet the Morrison government made no attempt to smooth the entirely predictable surge in demand for renewal applications that was to come when international travel resumed, or to prepare the resources in the Public Service that would be needed to deal with them when they came.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They weren't doing the basics of government, and Australian travellers were left to pay the price. They paid the price in that terrible anxiety, worrying about family holidays being cancelled when one member of the family is still waiting on a passport application to be approved. And countless hours were wasted in frustration in overlong telephone queues, and in queues running around the block from passport offices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to have been able to take quick action with the foreign minister to begin addressing this problem. Since the election, we have doubled the number of staff in the Australian Passport Office from roughly 730 to around 1,400. The queues at passport offices have all but vanished, and the call waiting times are down to just a couple of minutes now. We're still dealing with the backlog, but by the end of next month we hope to have returned to normal passport processing times, and to have restored the high-quality passport services Australians appreciate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the staff from the Australian Passport Office and the wider Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who have pitched in across the organisation to help fix this mess, including—I noted some commentary on Twitter—the 2022 DFAT graduate class. These public servants, in the passport office in particular, went above and beyond, working very long hours and staying hours after the end of their shift to meet this surging demand amidst enormous public frustration and media scrutiny. Thank you to all of you for going above and beyond in doing your job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges that we faced in the Australian Passport Office struck me particularly acutely in the foreign affairs portfolio because the ability to travel, to connect and to engage overseas is part of who we are as Australians. The Australian people are deeply connected with the world around us, and this matters to our broader foreign policy. As Minister Wong has underlined: 'Our foreign policy is an expression of our values, our interests and our identity. It starts with who we are.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our foreign policy objective in this term of government, as it should be for every government, is to grow Australia's power and influence around the world. As the ferocious travel schedule of our new foreign minister, our defence minister and our Prime Minister has already demonstrated, we intend to do this with new energy and increased resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're also taking a new approach. One of the ways that we'll maximise our influence is by highlighting the common ground of modern Australia with the world around us. We're a nation where more than half of our population was born overseas or has a parent born overseas. We're a nation of more than 300 ethnic heritages. My electorate in Melbourne's west is representative of this. Two-thirds of my constituents were born overseas or have a parent born overseas. That's true of my family as well, where two-thirds of my immediate family were either born overseas or have a parent born overseas. In fact, it might be 75 per cent. There isn't a country on earth that isn't connected to modern multicultural Australia, and we intend to leverage this to maximise our influence. There's not a country in the world that we can't reach out to and draw on commonality, on a shared interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also a nation who proudly celebrates our First Nations peoples, the oldest continuing culture in the world. You saw some of that celebration in the very moving condolence motions for Archie Roach that the chamber has just heard today. We'll draw on this heritage to develop an Indigenous foreign policy, weaving First Nations voices and practices into the way that we talk to the world and into the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This new approach is already creating new bonds and common interests around the world, particularly with our Pacific family, from whom we have a lot to learn on this front.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw modern Australia this week in this place. I've often commented that Australia is one of the most successful multicultural nations in the world, but we have monocultural institutions of power. This week has seen a slight break—progress made in changing that unacceptable reality. Half of the new members of the Albanese Labor government have either a multicultural heritage or are Indigenous Australians. This parliament welcomes new members and senators with cultural heritages from Laos, India, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Malaysia and Vietnam, along with more Indigenous representatives than ever before. As I've sat and listened to their first speeches, it's made me proud to be Australian, proud to be Labor and proud to represent this country internationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Reid, a new member of Chinese-Laotian heritage, noted in her first speech, the House of Representatives 'is starting to live up to its name,' because 'representatives that embody all of the Australian story make our parliament better and our democracy stronger.' Senator Stewart took this further in her first speech, welcoming this new diversity but emphasising, 'Now we need to move beyond just looking like the country we're here to represent and add some colour to our words and our actions.' Just today, the new member for Higgins further explored this theme, noting that one of the great unaccounted for strengths of this country, one of our great assets, is our social cohesion in the context of this diversity, which is an enormous source of social capital that can be drawn on by governments, by business and by community members as a whole. And I am particularly proud that while these speeches celebrated the emerging modern Australia they didn't deny the difficult path that we have travelled as a nation to get here. The member for Swan, a new MP of Goan Indian heritage by way of Kenya and Kalgoorlie—find me a more Australian story than that—told the House in her first speech about her family story of an initial rejection from the Australian Embassy in Kenya when they applied to migrate to this country, first being told, 'You have the right skills but you are the wrong colour,' only to be subsequently welcomed after Gough Whitlam dismantled the White Australia policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In their presence here and in their words, these MPs tell the true story of the greatness of our country. A failure to own who we once were opens a space to our adversaries to sow false narratives about who we are today. And those who seek to deny Australia's difficult history on race don't just lack credibility; they also deny our greatest strength as a nation, as a democratic nation: our ability to change and to grow as a people and as a nation. Who would deny in this chamber today that we are a not far greater nation today than we were when Edmund Barton was our first Prime Minister? We've outgrown them. We have transcended them. We have seen the error in our ways with the White Australia policy and we have built something so much better here today. We should tell this story and we should celebrate it. We can all be proud of the journey we have gone on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hearing these individual stories by these new members in this parliament, listening and reflecting in important venues like this chamber makes us stronger as a country and more influential overseas. Modern Australia is not an ethno-nationalist state. We need to actively build the bonds that tie us together as Australians, to bring together what Noel Pearson has called the three stories of modern Australia, the three stories that together make the one story of Australia: tens of thousands of years of continuing Indigenous heritage, our Westminster institutions and our thriving multicultural migration. You can't tell the story of Australia without telling those three stories. It is essential for nation-building and vital for our international relations. We need to own our history, to celebrate our ability to change and grow, to be proud of our diversity and to use it all as a source of national strength. It is doubly important that we do so as we have some change and growth still to do—on this front, underlined by the task in front of this parliament to get on with the implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the First Nations Voice to parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to someone who embodied the best of the Australian spirit. Associate Professor Joseph Epstein AM was a remarkable physician who made a contribution to my community in the western suburbs of Melbourne. Joe passed away on 20 June. Joe started working in Footscray in 1963 as a medical student and went on to spend 50 years as a surgeon at Footscray Hospital where he founded the emergency department—an emergency department frequented by my family and children quite regularly. Joe loved Melbourne's west, the people, the stories and their attitude to life, and Melbourne's west loved Joe, his compassion, his advocacy and his sheer determination to push for better health outcomes for all of us, including our community in Melbourne's west. His loss will be felt not only in our community but right across Australia, where his leadership in emergency management and public health will have an enduring legacy. He was a mentor to generations of doctors and nurses, advised ministers and bureaucrats and was a champion for equality and access to health care for all, particularly for First Australians. A 50-page 2016 tribute book to Joseph described him well, as 'a physician, surgeon, mentor, agent provocateur, philosopher, politician, photographic historian and raconteur', truly a life well lived. I offer my deepest condolences to Joe's family and friends and to the emergency medical community in Australia, who continue to live out his legacy in my community on a daily basis. In particular I want to acknowledge Joe's wife, Jan, who was a constant source of love and support for him and who made all of his achievements possible. On that note, I have the great honour in preceding the first speech of my good friend the newly elected member for Hawke.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  It is a great honour to stand here in this parliament, embedded beneath a grassy hill on the lands of the Ngunnawal and the Ngambri people, the traditional custodians of the Canberra area. I pay my respects to their elders, past, present and emerging. I also acknowledge the Wurundjeri and Wadawurrung people, who have for millennia been custodians of the earth, the trees, the water, the animals and the sky that now make up the electorate of Hawke. I extend my respects to the First Nations members of this parliament and to all First Nations members people here today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru statement is a gracious offering, a road map towards reconciliation—voice, treaty, truth. If, like me, you believe in Australia and believe it to be the greatest country on this planet then we must have the courage to face history, find a shared truth and forge a future together with our Indigenous sisters and brothers, steeped in the confidence of justice. I thank and applaud the Prime Minister for his characteristic conviction and leadership on this most important matter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would not be here today but for two extraordinary women: my mum, Penelope, and my partner, Zoe. My mum is an educator, a unionist, a community activist and a matriarch. The sharpest of intellects, and with the strength of weathered granite, Mum devoted her professional life to public education. She lived her collectivist values every day and proselytised them as she weaponised education against structural disadvantage, inequity and misfortune in our community. Mum raised my younger brothers and I here in Canberra, in Tuggeranong, the deep southern suburbs, far from the civic splendour of the parliamentary precinct. She poured her love into us. She was the patient, omnipotent manifestation of security and protection, and occasionally the furious personification of consequence when circumstances demanded it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My brothers, Joshua and Isaac, are testament to her parental artistry. They are men of integrity, of consideration, of humanity and of humour. With all my love and pride, I acknowledge them and their beautiful families: Josh, his partner, Silvie, and their son, Ernest; and Zac, his partner, Ella, and their children, Gene and Clement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mum, thank you for your unwavering, limitless love and for giving us absolutely everything you have to give. I love you very dearly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other seminal woman of my life is my partner in all things: Zoe Edwards. Zoe is my best friend, my confidante, the person I most admire. She is the smartest, funniest, most passionate, compassionate and inspiring being to grace this planet. She has devoted her own professional life to furthering the interests of working people, as an industrial lawyer, as a scholarly practitioner of public policy and as a proud trade unionist. Our life together is gloriously lit in chaotic technicolour by our beautiful children, Hunter, Banjo and the eagerly anticipated little sister in mum's tummy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hunny, Banji, little sister: I'm sorry for the inevitable sacrifices that we have chosen for you to make. Like all the other parents here, we make these sacrifices so that you and your generation can inherit a world that is kinder, stronger and more just. You are the sun and the stars and the very quiet space in between of our universe. Mum and I are so proud of you, and we love you with every atom of our beings. And Zoe: I lack the eloquence required to give lyrics to the music of our life together. I love you and I adore you. Thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the presence of Zoe's mum, Sarah, a fiercely loving mother and grandmother. Thank you for being here and for all that you do—and the absence of Zoe's dad, Scott, who passed away in 2015, a brilliant intellectual, a passionate Labor activist and a beloved friend of mine. He would have been elated by the election of this Albanese Labor government and had much to contribute in terms of unsolicited policy direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke has always been my political hero. His enthusiastic ambition for our great country was fuelled by his zealous belief in its exceptional potential—a belief that I share. He brought together disparate interests and ideologies. He gave our nation the confidence to face our region and the world, to make an impact far beyond our dry weight. And, it must be said, he had an exquisite head of hair. In humbly standing here as the inaugural member for Hawke, named for this great Prime Minister and patriot, I pay tribute to him and his legacy, to Blanche d'Alpuget and the extended Hawke family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Hawke is aptly named—encompassing places and people that I believe Bob would have been proud to be associated with. Stretching from Sunbury, Bulla and Diggers Rest in the north-east, we clinch Hillside on the outer edge of Melbourne suburbia. Heading west, Melton is the geographical heart of Hawke, before the Western Freeway drops down into the evocative agrarian valley where Bacchus Marsh lies at the convergence of the mighty Werribee and Lerderderg rivers. Further west again is the beautiful town of Ballan, where Zoe and I have chosen to raise our family. To the north is the goldrush town of Blackwood, surrounded by the wilderness of the Lerderderg and Wombat forests, and to the south, the Brisbane Ranges, straddled by the bucolic regions of Beremboke and Balliang.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our communities are diverse. We have some of the fastest growing parts of Australia—Melton is on track to have a bigger population than Canberra by 2050—where the grazing and rock farms yield to new houses and new families, families buying their first homes, in many cases establishing themselves in Australia for the first time, in all, working hard to make a better life for themselves and their loved ones. These pioneers contribute richly to the social, cultural and economic fabric of our existing communities, and we welcome them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But these enrichening changes also bring significant challenges. Population growth is putting our physical and social infrastructure under immense pressure. After a decade of wilful investment failure by those opposite, our roads and transport infrastructure are inadequate to service our communities, severely impacting our quality of life and, in some cases, our safety. Our primary healthcare system is collapsing. It takes weeks to see a GP. Our modest hospitals can't handle the increased demand and lack the capability to treat the complexity of conditions that come with population explosion and diversification, much less a global pandemic. We have great schools and dedicated teachers, but enrolments are rapidly increasing. We need better facilities, and our teachers need a federal government—this federal government—that will have their backs and value their toil. In all of Hawke we have no TAFE, no university, no public technical or trade apprenticeship school, no local education prospect beyond year 12 for our kids to aspire to. We need jobs—local, secure, well-paid jobs—and we need the economic investment to sustain those jobs perennially.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Hawke are workers, and through that work they contribute to our society and they derive dignity. We are the teachers, the healthcare workers, the cleaners, the farmers, the drivers and the baggage handlers. We work in hospitality, child care, factories, construction and transport. During COVID the workers of Hawke kept our country moving, delivering medicines and vaccines, caring for our loved ones, maintaining our domestic supply chains and putting food on our tables. They paid a disproportionate cost for these contributions with their health and the health of their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the people I represent, I am a worker. When I first left school I worked as a labourer in a factory in Queanbeyan. I've washed dishes. I've cared for kids. I've answered phones in a call centre. I've advised on policy and campaigned for the things I believe in. I've been a partner at one of the biggest firms on the planet. I am equally proud of each of these contributions. From each I have learnt something of myself and the world. I've learnt how to fight for the things I believe in. I'm here to fight for the people and communities of Hawke and play a role in the fight for our national interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Hawke was drawn from McEwen, Ballarat and Gorton. I want to acknowledge and thank my Labor colleagues Rob Mitchell, Catherine King and Brendan O'Connor for their support during the campaign and for previously representing our communities so admirably. While I get the great honour of standing in this place, Labor's victory in Hawke is due to the collective heroic efforts of Labor members, union comrades, community activists and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Brad Macpherson, Chantal and Brad Yates, Ryan Little, Ravinder Kaur, Derrick Simpson, Brad Stewart, Rhonda Edmonds, Daryl Baker, Tor Roxburgh, Barry Agg, Kylie Spencer, Nathan Miles, Jarrod Bell, Andrew and Shannon Gould, Russell Bell, Ed Abrehart, Jo Fox, Ben Davison, Ken Hardy, Ash Vandenberg, Lara Carli, Steve Abboushi, Carly Moore, Dut Athian, Beth Maplestone, Greg Fleming, Glenn Barfoot, Chris Wells, the great Andrew 'Tiny' McLean and so many more. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I specially acknowledge the wonderful people associated with the Khalsa Shaouni Sikh temple in Plumpton, especially my dear friends Gurdarshan, Avtar and Simar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also grateful and humbled by the support I received from our sisters and brothers in the trade union movement: Michael Donovan and the SDA, Dylan Wight and the AMWU, and my friends at the ETU, ASU, RTBU and ANMF. I particularly want to acknowledge the mighty Transport Workers Union. I'm a proud member of the TWU and am ever grateful for the support and friendship of Secretary Mike McNess, former secretary John Berger, National Secretary Michael Kaine, National Assistant Secretary Nick McIntosh and all of the TWU organisers and members. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I especially want to acknowledge and thank my great friend Assistant Secretary Mehmet Suleyman. Mem has devoted his life to serving the members of our union, to fighting for their rights and their safety. I would not be here were it not for his friendship, encouragement and strategic nous. I am eternally pledged to our union's struggle for safe rates and better conditions for all transport workers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I find my feet in this new role I am very ably supported by the best of staff: Henry Fox, Di McAuliffe and Millie Page. I thank you for your wisdom, passion for our community and tolerance of me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout my various professional incarnations I've been so lucky to enjoy the mentorship of the superlative exemplars in each field: Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, a person who approaches politics, public policy and life with the deepest of consideration and intelligence; Senator Don Farrell, my first boss in politics, who, along with his wife, Nimfa, remains my benchmark of integrity and decency in our business; former senator Stephen Conroy, a person of such profound conviction, coupled with the courage and strategic brilliance to drive that conviction to impact; and James Mackenzie and Peter Konidaris, who have mastered the noble art of progressing the public good from the shimmering towers of the business sector. And in all matters of life there's my fraternal friendship with Philip Dalidakis—all the candour of his intellect and the generosity of his spirit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a great presence missing from this House tonight, a mentor and a friend without whom I would not be here. Former senator Mehmet Tillem was a person of consequence. He was deeply principled, intelligent, full of humility and humour. He was a natural leader of people. He was inspiring and courageous. His generous friendship was protective and warm. He should have been here today, as he should have remained in the other place to continue his life's work in the pursuit of fairness for all people. But, sadly, he was lost to us far too young, just shy of three years ago. His wife, Ferda, and son, Mikhail, are here today, and I'm honoured by their presence. Mikki: your father was a great man who was respected and loved, and who I admired immensely. He loved you so very much, and he was so proud of you. You were the absolute centre of his universe. Thank you both for being here today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not individual exceptionalism that has propelled me here, but rather the collective efforts and investments of so many special people. I have mentioned some already, but there are others who must be acknowledged for their talents and friendship, those who have watched upon the wall and laboured with me for our shared values: Ella George, Noah Carroll, Cal Viney, Tig Huggins, Bassel Tallal, Samuel Lynch, Emma Henderson, Jett Fogarty, Martha Haylett, Christopher Ford, Hakki and Natalie Suleyman, Chris Lovell, Steve Palmer, Kos Samaras, Alan Griffin, Ros Spence, the Palmer Street family, the comrades, the Memorial Ducks, the ANU foresters, the PwC crew and the MBS legends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to the team at Victorian Labor and the ALP national secretariat for executing a brilliant campaign. Thank you to my Labor colleagues, friends whom I admire and am proud to count myself amongst. And thank you to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for your principled leadership and for reminding Australia that we are a compassionate, intelligent and ambitious nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have already said, I'm here to fight for the people of Hawke, and to stamp our values upon the national conversation. Fundamental to the issues we face as communities and the nation is the concept of prosperity. I don't speak of the false prosperity espoused by those opposite, measured only in financial wealth and its competitive accrual. I speak of the prosperity enjoyed by citizens who are both mentally and physically healthy, where we and our loved ones can access world-class health care as a matter of right. I speak of the prosperity of opportunity, provided and inspired by access to education, training, fulfilling employment and vocational pride; the prosperity generated by quality of life. I speak of the civic structures and infrastructure that facilitate our social and economic contributions, our moral and monetary reward, and the expedient return to the embrace of our families. I speak of the prosperity secured by valuing our environment and our planet, by making decisions based on sustainability and triple-bottom-line outcomes, for meaningful action on climate change that creates jobs and fuels our economy with cheap, clean renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I joined the Labor Party because I believe that the role of government is to maximise prosperity, to grow the collective pie and to ensure it is apportioned according to our community's collective interests. This stands in stark contrast to the ideologies of the other parties, to the Left and to the Right, where too often the maximising of prosperity for the many is usurped by the constituency, cravenly clambering to secure the largest portion at the expense of the greater good.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations publishes the Human Development Index, which measures and ranks all countries by whether people had the freedom and opportunity to live a life they value. In 2013, the year Labor lost office after fending off the global financial crisis, Australia was ranked second in the world on that index, behind only Norway. In 2019—the latest available report—Norway was still on top, but the years of coalition government had seen Australia drop to eighth place—a squandering of our prosperity. We now draw a line under this lost decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be a member of a government that will capitalise on the natural strengths of our country, address our shortcomings with constructive honesty and always be guided by our values. We will invest in a prosperous future, in health and education, for our children and theirs. We will face the historical injustices perpetrated against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We will unlock Australia's true economic potential by investing in Australian industries, fuelling them with sovereign and renewable energy supplies and creating secure, well-paid jobs. In doing so, we will take real and sustainable action on climate change, in a way that empowers and rewards those who are most exposed and least privileged. We must rebalance the relationship between workers and employers, reform our broken bargaining system to ensure labour is properly priced and real wage rises are realised by working people. We are pursuing the most ambitious of programs and we have the energy, the passion and the capability to deliver real and lasting prosperity for our country and our communities. And then, in the dusk of day, when we have fought and delivered for the communities of Hawke, Australia and our region, I'll go home where I belong, with my family.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  Congratulations to the member for Hawke for his maiden speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all stand in this place and look forward to the 47th Parliament, I want to thank the people of Forde for giving me the privilege and honour of once again representing them in federal parliament. I look back to when I was first elected, in 2010. It seems so long ago that I was first elected, and to now stand in this place at the start of my fifth term is a real privilege and honour. Many of my colleagues now haven't experienced life on this side of the House, but I find myself returning to the opposition benches, where I served in my first term. Sadly, many of my colleagues from the last parliament won't be returning to this place. I take this opportunity to acknowledge their outstanding contribution to the Liberal-National coalition and to their country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As most people know, to be successful in a federal election campaign—or any election campaign, for that matter—requires an awful lot of support, help and assistance from a great variety of people. I want to take this opportunity to thank those people. I want to thank my colleagues—former Prime Minister Morrison, former minister Fletcher; former minister Stuart Robert, the member for Fadden; and former minister Colbeck—who came to my electorate during the campaign. And how could I ever forget Senator Cash's visit? In the middle of prepoll, at one of our many prepoll booths, we ended up buying her a set of gumboots because her footwear at that point was not appropriate for the conditions at prepoll! I'd like to thank my FDC executive and all the FDC members for their hard work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The team in my office, led so ably by Jessica Howard, my chief of staff, include Alanah, Katie, Vanessa, Peter, Zane, Lynette, Bonnie, Nicholas, Roz and Vicki, a tremendous team that did an awful lot of work well over and above the call of duty. To all of the supporters, donors, volunteers who, for two weeks at prepoll, stood in the rain and mud and who helped so ably on polling day, also in the rain, wind and mud, who have supported me over many years over my five campaigns, thank you very much. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I want to take the opportunity to thank my family. After five successful election campaigns, my loving wife, Judi, and my two sons have been through a lot. With hand on heart I can admit that I could not do it without them, and they have my deep and heartfelt thanks. The six-week campaign for the 2022 election was one of the hardest I have been involved in, and the task was not made any easier by the seemingly constant cold and wet weather. As I said before, to all of the volunteers and those who stood in the mud to hand out how-to-vote cards at prepoll and at polling booths across the electorate, thank you so very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But as I look back, I am proud of what we as a government achieved over the last nine years. While it is disappointing to be on this side of the chamber, I look back with pride on what we have been delivering for our local community. At the end of the day, what is most important is that we are delivering results for our local community to make the lives of everybody in our electorates better each and every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent a diverse area and one of the fastest-growing areas in Australia, the northern Gold Coast, which I share with the member for Fadden in the City of Logan, with the member for Rankin, the Treasurer, and also with the member for Wright, Deputy Speaker Buchholz. If I look at the growth in those communities since I first got elected in 2010, it is nothing short of extraordinary. Tens of thousands of people have moved into those communities over the last 12 years, and we see that now each and every day with the growth in the requirements of infrastructure right across the electorate. That is why I am pleased that I can stand here and say that, over the past nine years, the coalition government has delivered its share of the funding and has made those commitments for the upgrade of the M1 to the tune of $1.25 billion, from the Gateway to the Logan motorway. These projects are now well under way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker Buchholz has been an advocate for the $16 million upgrade to the Mount Lindesay Highway at North Mclean and now the $75 million duplication of the Mount Lindesay Highway from Stoney Camp Road to Chambers Flat Road. Deputy Speaker Buchholz well knows how important that piece of road is as a lifeline not only to the western part of the City of Logan but also to the Scenic Rim, and equally how important the M1 is as a lifeline and a major artery between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, providing access for those rapidly growing communities. Equally I am proud of the fact that as a coalition government we announced funding for the upgrade between Kuraby and Beenleigh to allow for fast rail, which will also include also upgrades to stations in my electorate at Loganlea, Bethania, Beenleigh and Eden's Landing. All of this will continue to serve these rapidly growing communities and provide transport solutions that are alternatives to hopping in the car and going on the M1, particularly.  But it's not only these big infrastructure projects; it's also the smaller projects across the electorate, like providing funding for upgraded services through both the headspace at Meadowbrook and, importantly, a new headspace service in Upper Coomera, allied with the new Medicare funded MRI service in Upper Coomera, run by Qscan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I look at these achievements, I look back with pride at what we achieved over the last nine years in government. I disagree with those opposite—which I'm sure they're not surprised by—and I'm proud of the fact that, despite the level of debt we now have as a nation, over the past two years, through the largest pandemic this country has faced in 100 years, through the measures the former government took, we kept people in jobs, we kept small businesses' doors open and we kept our economy ticking over, to the extent that now we have one of the greatest economic outcomes coming out of COVID—although we're still dealing with COVID to this day—of any nation on the planet. I think we should be extraordinarily proud of that. There is nothing more important, from my perspective, than keeping a roof over somebody's head, helping them keep their business open and helping them keep their employees engaged and working in that business. There is nothing better than somebody having a job to go to each and every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there are businesses—because I've met and spoken with them in my electorate—who haven't been successful in surviving the last 2½ years, and that's incredibly disappointing, because that impacts not only those business owners but their families and their friends and gives them a mental strain about what they're going to do for the future. But, by and large, the measures that were put in place by the former government—the government that I was part of for the last nine years—provided tremendous support to our economy at a very, very difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important aspect of our communities is our sporting clubs and community organisations. I have, like many of us in this place, many of those types of organisations across the community of Forde. I'm pleased to say that, again, the former government was successful in providing funding to those organisations to upgrade their facilities. As Deputy Speaker Buchholz would know—because it is the same with many of the sporting facilities in his part of the world—many of the sporting facilities in the city of Logan are well past their use-by date and require upgrades. I'm pleased we were able to provide funding to Logan Lightning Football Club for the upgrade of Chris Green Park. It is a football club that I played for for a number of years. In its former life, as Beenleigh Soccer Club, it was where I started my senior footballing career. I played over 100 games for the club before I went on to play at a higher level. They have been successful this year in reaching the round of 32 for the Australia Cup, which is our version of the FA Cup. It's the first time in their history they've succeeded in that. That $600,000 investment built on another $350,000 investment a couple of years ago for their Cornubia Park facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at a club like Mustangs Brothers Rugby League Football Club, a small club at Chambers Flat who do extraordinary work in their local community. We were successful in providing $150,000 in funding for them to upgrade their lights and upgrade their fields in conjunction with Logan City Council and also some state government funds. We invested $92,000 in refurbishing the tennis courts at Beenleigh Tennis Centre. The result of that is that now Tennis Queensland has put a proposal together to turn the Beenleigh Tennis Centre into a regional tennis centre. And had we been successful at the last election, there was a $5 million commitment from us to bring that to fruition. These commitments have had a significant and positive impact on many of the residents and sporting communities across the electorate. I'll continue to advocate for those key projects across our community in this term of parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I'd like to bring to the attention of the House the work that needs to be done on Exit 38 at Yatala. This is an exit that services one of the largest employment centres on the northern Gold Coast that is still rapidly growing. Some mornings we will have a tailback of traffic from that exit of more than a kilometre on the M1 in a 110-kilometre-an-hour zone. I'm pleased to say that during the election campaign we made a commitment, if we got re-elected, of $55 million towards upgrading that exit, as we are doing already with Exit 41; the smaller project on Exit 45; and Exit 49, which will commence later this year. That builds on the successful upgrade that we achieved several years ago to Exit 54 at Upper Coomera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government—and I've already written to the Prime Minister in this context—to match that $55 million of funding that we committed to get this project off the ground. It is critical to the safety of motorists on the M1, it is critical to allowing people to get to work safely and get home safely, and it is critical to the freight task that is now the major component of the Yatala Enterprise Area, which straddles both sides of the M1 on the northern Gold Coast. It is also important because—I had a meeting with a company earlier this week who are building a new factory out at Yatala, relocating from Hemmant in Brisbane. I'm also aware that Visy is talking about building a new glass bottling plant. So the call on this infrastructure is not going to get any less; it's only going to get greater, and that's before we start talking about the residential development that's going on on the northern Gold Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, there is still plenty of capacity for upgrades to our sporting and community facilities. As I've touched on already, Tennis Queensland has proposed a regional tennis hub in Beenleigh. But we also have upgrades to facilities like Beenleigh's Hammel Park, the home of our local netball clubs—well, the home of one of our local netball clubs—baseball and rugby league. We look at projects such as the upgrade to the clubhouse for Ormeau FC, a rapidly growing small football club in the northern part of the Gold Coast. These are projects—and there are many others—that I will continue to fight for, for my community, over this coming term of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we go into this new term of government, I hear much said and made about the issue of a changing climate. Now, I have no issue with the argument that our climate is changing and that we need to take responsibility for looking after our environment, to leave a better environment for future generations of this country. I will say, however, that I disagree with some of the methods of going about it and some of the commentary that's been made. I want to take issue with some of the commentary about the flooding that has occurred in my patch over the last little while. Can I say that worse floods have occurred in my area historically. One that I remember particularly well was in 1974, given how close to getting flooded our house was at that time. But what I find immensely frustrating and immensely disappointing is that, despite the relatively recent nature of that flood, within the living memory of many people in my community in the city of Logan, we have seen successive councils continue to allow houses to be built on flood plains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are serious about dealing with the impacts of a change in climate in a practical sense, we have to seriously look at our planning schemes and our approval processes to ensure that we don't continue to build houses in the path of potential floodwaters. The same happened in Townsville with the floods in 2017. Areas that were flooded when I lived in Townsville in 1998 have had brand new housing estates built on them. It is the height of irresponsibility for us to be building properties in those areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of that is to ensure that our infrastructure is properly designed to ensure we minimise the impact of flooding events to upstream communities. Part of that is the design of our bridges. In many instances, we build our bridges from riverbank to riverbank. We don't build them across the flood plain, and the consequence of that is that, in a flood, they act as a dam and push water back upstream. You end up getting flooding further upstream in houses that maybe didn't flood in the past when you had different infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are simple, practical measures that we can start to undertake now to reduce the impact of flood events. Will we reduce it entirely? No, we won't, but it is a good and positive start. I'm pleased to say that the previous government started to look at this stuff.</span>
              </p>

The class of 2022 brings the number of elected members as representatives of our communities to 1,240 since Federation. I feel very fortunate to have this rare opportunity to influence the direction of change for our community and country. It is something I will reflect on every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to congratulate my colleagues on all sides of the chamber for their success at the election, especially the other 34 new members. We have an obligation to serve with dignity and respect, displaying the leadership qualities expected of those elected to office. And, in reflecting on that fact, I want to affirm that every person has a right to feel safe and valued in the workplace, including all people for whom this is a workplace. We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to unacceptable behaviour. We must set the standard. To be here is not a right; it is an honour bestowed on us by the people. It is our duty to improve standards across society through the considered decisions we make every day in this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to acknowledge His Excellency the Governor-General and commend him on a powerful opening to parliament and a distinguished contribution to our democracy. I congratulate the Speaker of the House on your appointment and I wish you all the best in the role. To the voters of Spence: thank you—thank you for placing your trust in me to be your representative in parliament; it is truly humbling. I will work hard every day to deliver for our community. To the hundreds of volunteers who gave up their time during the campaign: you make the impossible possible. Thank you for your generosity. To my dedicated campaign team—Matthew Marozzi, Chelsea Bishop, Ruben Bala and Caleb Flight—thank you for keeping me focused and on track. To my wonderful staff—Matthew Werfel, Nymfa Farrell, Alex Pados, Scott Johnstone, Louise Drummond and Alex Coates—thank you for ensuring that our electorate office is open for business and running smoothly, enabling us to meet the expectations of all in our community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a proud member of the Australian Labor Party, a party that stands and delivers change for the betterment of all. We are staunch in our pursuit of fairness, equality and social inclusion. We strive every day to enhance the wellbeing of our communities. To the state Labor secretary, Aemon Burke; his predecessor, Reggie Martin MLC; and the broader party membership: thank you for your friendship, guidance and support over many years. To my great mate, TWU branch secretary Ian Smith: thank you for the opportunity to represent the road transport industry for the last six years as an organiser; I am grateful that you took a punt on me. We have enjoyed a great friendship forged from hard work and mutual dedication to advancing the cause of fairness for working people. You have been a fantastic mentor, and I thank you for your guidance. To Michael Kaine, Nick McIntosh, Richard Olsen, Tim Dawson, Mike McNess and your teams around the country: thank you for your support and encouragement over many years. To Josh Peak, Sonia Romeo and the team at the SDA: thank you. It has been a rewarding journey working alongside your union. To Brett Larkin, Campbell Duignan, Jamie Newlyn, Christy Caine, Paddy Crumlin and all the MUA rank and file: thank you. You have been fantastic mentors during my formative years within the trade union movement. I am grateful for your support during my almost 10-year career at sea as a seafarer, delegate and advocate for workplace safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the AWU and broader union movement: thank you. A little over 12 months ago, I approached a very close mentor and confidante for advice around pursuing preselection and life as a parliamentarian. Former Senator Alex Gallacher, unfortunately, is no longer with us. He was a fierce advocate for the preservation of superannuation and the improvement of road safety for all. In his absence, I would like to thank his wife, Paola, for allowing me the time to seek his counsel on a regular basis; I hope to meet the expectations he set out for me in those formative discussions. I would like to thank Senator Don Farrell; the member for Kingston, Amanda Rishworth; and Senator Marielle Smith for their time and support during my campaign and since. I look forward to working with you all over the coming years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in Mildura, in the surrounds of Sunraysia. Born to my parents, Julie and Glen, my life started out on the dark clay soils of the Murray River junction town of Curlwaa, on 45 acres of citrus and vegetables. Dad was a farmer. Mum, a nurse, was our carer, and raised me and two younger sisters, Georgina and Kristina. Our house was small and modest, a 10-by-10 fibro farmhouse. It was our home—a home I remember fondly to this day. My parents were involved in all aspects of our community—the tennis club, the Country Women's Association and the Country Fire Service, to name a few. Community was a way of life, where everyone looked out for each other in the district. This sense of community and service was something encouraged in us by our parents, and I always felt supported in my pursuit of life—although, upon telling my mother that I'd enlisted into the Army Reserve with the 8/7th Royal Victoria Regiment, I think that support may have wavered as only a mother's care can for the safety of a child.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my mum, Julie, and sisters Georgina and Kristina: thank you. I thank you for your support, especially since the loss of my best mate with dad's passing in 2017. I know if he were still here with us, he would have been so proud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my amazing wife, Cassandra: I wish you could have been here today. I feel I've waited a lifetime to find you, or for you to find me. You are my lodestar. You keep me grounded, and I will be forever grateful for your selflessness in supporting me. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my predecessor, the Hon. Nick Champion, with over 15 years dedicated to this place and the people of Spence—formerly Wakefield: you helped to shape and deliver lasting outcomes for our community. I thank you for your contribution, friendship, wise counsel and enlightened wit. I wish you all the best in your endeavours within the South Australian parliament as part of the Malinauskas Labor government, and look forward to working alongside you within our respective electorates for many years to come.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The division of Spence was named in honour of Catherine Helen Spence, a formidable pioneer of the women's suffrage movement, an advocate for electoral reform and a champion for women's representation in parliament during the late 1800s. Spence is a diverse electorate, stretching from St Kilda on the Gulf St Vincent across the Adelaide plains to Gawler, from the hills of Humbug Scrub in the Mount Lofty Ranges and across the flat to Angle Vale. It takes in the Salisbury, Playford, Gawler, Light Regional and the Barossa councils. It's home to one of the most culturally diverse communities across Australia. Historically known for agriculture, manufacturing and defence, it is home to RAAF Base Edinburgh, which plays a significant role in our homeland defence and operations abroad. I thank all our current and former defence personnel for their service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Spence is also well known for developing some of the AFL's greatest players—home to names like O'Loughlin, Wanganeen, Bond, Burgoyne and Warrior, to name a few. We are home to iconic South Australian brands such as SAFCOL, Bickfords and RM Williams. Winaityinaityi Pangkara, the country of the birds, is the acclaimed Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary National Park. It starts at the beaches of St Kilda, running north along the coast for 60 kilometres, and forms part of the East Asian-Australasian flyway, a significant flight route for migratory birds across the world, part of a diverse ecosystem in the area and tourist destination for avid birdwatchers the world over.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The suburb of Elizabeth, named in honour of the Queen, was the centre of a significant population expansion in the mid-1900s, welcoming migrants, particularly from the United Kingdom, to help expand our manufacturing capabilities within South Australia. Now, our electorate welcomes migrants from around the world to be part of building our future. We are a place of opportunity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm extremely fortunate to have enjoyed opportunity throughout my life. My parents cared for our education as kids. Foundational literacy and numeracy were fundamental basics that our parents instilled in us. For many years, I took these skills for granted. My work has exposed me to the realisation that there are high levels of illiteracy in the workforce and the community. Unfortunately, for far too many, this fails to be recognised or addressed until far too late in the learning cycle. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we fail to invest strongly in early education, we run the risk of missing out on the next David Unaipon or Dame Roma Mitchell. It is a risk that could compromise our ability as a people to solve the greatest challenge of our future. More than that, failure to invest appropriately in public education is an abrogation of our responsibility to honour every young person's fundamental right to a good education. This is why I believe in the need to ensure every child in this country receives the best quality education and is supported to reach their full potential in life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From early childhood to higher learning, education is a gateway that opens us up to inclusive social experiences and better health outcomes, and gives us the capacity to adapt to an ever-changing global environment. It sets us up for success throughout life. Crucially, an educated workforce forms the foundation of a strong and successful economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a proud trade unionist, unashamedly proud. And to each and every worker: value your union and its membership as you would your passport. It is your ticket to good, secure, well-paid work. It opens you to the possibility of travel and so much more. As a member of the MUA and TWU, a former delegate and senior organiser, I have witnessed the exploitation of workers. Profit is put before people, and wage theft is often the norm not the exception. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen the collapse of our Australian merchant shipping fleet, forcing thousands of highly skilled seafarers onto dry land. We have 12 Aussie flagged ships left on our coast. It is a national disgrace that we have left ourselves so compromised, unable to respond in times of crisis. Our merchant navy has played vital roles in numerous conflicts, none more so than World War II, ensuring our armed forces were supplied with munitions, helped with the injured and refused to ship pig iron to the enemy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have watched the tsunami-like surge of the gig economy leave a trail of destruction in its wake, displacing traditional, well-paying jobs for systems where the lowest bidder wins the work. It has caused a fast-paced dash towards insecure work, cost cutting and avoidance of safety practices in the workplace. It has allowed the opportunity for the employer to turn off your ability to earn altogether, with a simple keystroke. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Amazon effect is forcing good companies with gold-standard agreements to the wall, in a war they just can't win. It is why we need a tribunal to set minimum rates and standards to protect both employees and employers, ensuring our roads are safe, our skies are safe and, above all, our people are safe. I cannot be any clearer when I see this: safe rates save lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many in the gallery today who have sat beside me at a negotiation table or opposite. I am unapologetic for being a fierce advocate in demanding fair outcomes for workers. We need to adopt an approach where our workforce is seen as an asset and not a liability, where loyalty in both directions is rewarded, where the success for one is a success for the other. Fostering good workplace relationships with unions, workers and employers alike will lead to higher levels of productivity in the workplace, in turn, delivering better outcomes for all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Industries, governments and the community must work together more effectively in another critically important area—that is, the protection and preservation of the planet we share. We have all been witness to the tragic events over the last few years, from bushfires to flooding. It is clear we have a climate emergency. The only viable option for the future of humanity is to ensure we can sustain life here on earth. We owe it to ourselves, to our children and to future generations to leave the world not only habitable but thriving. The transition to a clean energy market is an exciting one. It will create new jobs and opportunities for our nation. By embracing change now, we can ensure prosperity for our country to become market leaders not market followers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also work to secure our food production. As a farmer's son, to me it was clear that our seasons were changing two or more decades ago. Water restrictions, brought on by lengthened periods of drought and upstream influences on water flow, affect the livelihoods of all who rely on access to secure water supply. Extreme weather events regularly affect crops and compromise the viability of primary production. Through sustainable, regenerative farming practices, we can ensure better yields by conserving the quality of our topsoils, using less water for our crops and limiting pesticides and herbicides.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must find new ways of packaging and distributing food and limiting its waste, providing safe, affordable, high-quality nutrition to Australia and the world. It is time to embrace the circular economy fully and find ways to recycle more products destined for landfill, more products that can be remade into new materials for building houses, roads, furniture and much more. These new materials will help with more-efficient buildings, requiring less energy consumption, delivering a new wave of meaningful employment for our next generation of workers, a fair go for all, and ensuring opportunity for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strengthening our communities is the Australian way. We have a moment in time, a moment when we must be bold and push the boundaries of the possible to achieve the impossible, where a dream of shooting for the stars becomes a reality, to be a nation that knows no limits and seizes the moment, to lift our people to a new generation of prosperity through the embrace of innovation and investment in the future. Leadership simply must come from government in these matters. With the election of an Albanese Labor government, Australians have given the signal that they are ready for a new chapter. To do my part in exercising the leadership that our community deserves, it will be my honour and privilege to serve the people of Spence and the nation in this the 47th Parliament of Australia. Thank you very much.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land upon which we gather today, the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, and also those in my electorate of Robertson, the Darkinjung people. I pay my respects to all elders past, all elders present and all elders emerging. What we must recognise is that the land upon which we work, the land upon which we love and the land upon which we live always was and always will be Aboriginal land. As a proud Wiradjuri man, living on Darkinyung country, to be here today—to have the honour and privilege of speaking in this place, representing my community—is the result of not just an electoral victory but the sacrifice, the courage and the commitment of those that have come before. We have an essential duty to listen to our elders, to hear them and to understand them, so that our light might shine brighter today than it did yesterday. This begins by implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will start by thanking the hardworking and welcoming people that are the constituents of Robertson. You are the reason that I stand here today, and it is an honour and a privilege to represent you. You are the reason that I will fight with all I have for the Central Coast. From the mighty peninsula, where I grew up in Umina, to the Gosford CBD, to the leafy suburbs of Empire Bay and Kincumber, to the waters of Davistown and Saratoga, over to Narara and Niagara Park in the north, to the sparkling beaches of Copacabana, Avoca, Terrigal and McMasters, to Kariong on top of the hill and to our more rural areas of Mangrove Mountain and Spencer, this is our place. To our world-class volunteers on the Central Coast—the rural fire service, state emergency service, surf lifesavers and all those that help our community in times of need—your dedication goes above and beyond, and we thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The campaign for Robertson was extraordinary. It was a grassroots movement centred around what matters—the health and wellbeing of others, the protection of our natural world and the accountability of those elected to govern. It was inspiring to see so many people, both in the party and throughout our community, come together to bring about much-needed change. It was and is a time for unity for the Central Coast, where every voice matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some exceptional people that must be mentioned today. Firstly, my family. To my beautiful partner Shaylee: you inspire me every day to be a better person and a better doctor. Your empathy and compassion have ensured that our journey here has been one of inclusivity and equality. With you by my side, everything is possible and nothing is unachievable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My father, Bryan Reid, raised in the council flats of Newtown, a nurse, a paramedic and now a small business owner, recognised the importance of education to overcome barriers. His father, Ronald Reid, who is no longer with us, and my beautiful nan, Aunty Robyn Reid, raised a giant of the Central Coast. My mother, Leanne Reid, a successful small business owner, is the most generous person you will ever meet and is the embodiment of selflessness. She was raised lovingly by her single mother, Elaine Rowan, who is watching on from her home in Woy Woy tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mum and Dad, I still remember you walking me to Umina Beach Public School. I still remember you being there when I finished school at Central Coast Grammar. I still remember looking out at the crowd at the University of Newcastle and seeing you there when I became a doctor. There has never been a time in my life when you have not been there for me. When I was growing up, you taught me the importance of people. You showed me and continue to show me how important it is to not leave people behind and to make sure that no-one—no-one—is held back. To my little sister Grace, a powerful, strong Indigenous woman capable of changing the world: Grace, you've always had a strong sense of what is right and what is wrong, and it is because of that you have always made sure that I have remained true and that I have remained focused on why I'm standing here today—people. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Jo Lloyd, one of the greatest campaign managers anyone could ever ask for, your commitment and your loyalty go above and beyond, and the people of Robertson and myself are so fortunate to have you on our side. To Jesse Corda, from the days we spent doorknocking in the rain, in the blistering heat and sometimes in both, to the thousands of phone calls we made in our tiny campaign office—we did it. Thanks, mate. And to my role models in the Labor community: Prime Minister Anthony Albanese; ministers Jason Clare, Chris Bowen and Ed Husic; assistant minister Emma McBride; Senator Deborah O'Neill and state member for Gosford Liesl Tesch, your support and guidance throughout the campaign have been absolutely invaluable, and I will be forever grateful. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given we had the backing of such a strong community-led campaign, including our wonderful branches, it would be impossible for me to single out individuals, but you know who you are. The community gave so much to our campaign, and I owe each and every one of you an incredible thanks. To all those sitting in the gallery, and those watching on from home, thank you for not only making this journey with me, but for every moment of your unwavering support. I want to recognise the previous member for Robertson for her commitment to our community, and I wish her and her family well for the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Health is not simply a state of being free from illness or injury. Health is the strength of a society and a community. Health is a community having access to affordable and equitable care and services. Health is having the freedom to go about our daily lives with the reassurance that those elected to represent us are held to account. Health is having a strong, clean, protected and sustainable environment. Health is having a sense of belonging through cultural acceptance and representation. Health is having the ability to participate in the workforce all while knowing your children are being cared for and educated to the absolute highest standard. Health is having a safe and secure place to call home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The health of our nation and, indeed, the Central Coast is front and centre to what we must achieve. I am so honoured to be part of a government that will change lives for the better. I have been particularly fortunate to serve my community through our health service, in particular, in our emergency departments. To work alongside great doctors like Dr Matthew Ingram, Dr Matthew Knox and Dr Liam Clifford and provide care for our most vulnerable truly is a privilege. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our hospitals are a place where it does not matter who you are, where you come from, or the circumstances leading to your presentation. You will be cared for and you will be cared for for free due to the hard-fought Labor initiative that saw a little, green card come into the lives of all Australians. A little, green card with the word that represents complete and universal access—Medicare. A place where the lights are always on. A place where you'll be met by some of the world's most highly trained nurses, doctors and support staff. A place where people do not expect to be and it often is the worst day in someone's life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shift I will now describe was not that dissimilar to many others that had come before it. But it was the turning point and why I stand before you today. I stand removing my PPE and washing my hands after seeing a patient, and then I hear the sound of the bat phone, a high-pitched shrill piercing the already noisy environment. The sound of that phone, the pre-arrival notification of a critically unwell patient, commands the attention of everyone in the room. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the loudspeaker—'bat call'. And so it begins. The team assembles in the resus. bay and roles are assigned: airway, breathing, circulation, drugs. We stand ready in full PPE to try and shield us from COVID-19, with a face mask essentially suctioned to our faces, eye protection and a face shield, and a long, splash-resistant gown with gloves. You feel the sweat running down your face and your neck, but you have no time to sit and no time to rest. The room must be prepared for the incoming patient. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then you hear it. You hear the sirens. The ambulance drives up to the resus bay, having to slow down because of the many other ambulances that are ramped and filled with unwell patients. The doors to the resus bay open, and paramedics are doing chest compressions and rescue breaths on the 55-year-old male that was found unresponsive on the floor of his home by his wife and young children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A cardiac arrest protocol begins in order to save the man's life. In the time that this happens, his wife arrives and is understandably distraught. Just under 20 metres away, in the waiting room, more patients present within minutes of each other—one with a stroke, another with a heart attack and many who are unable to afford or unable to see a GP in a timely manner. This is on top of a waiting room and a subacute area that only have standing room remaining and an acute section without any beds. The corridors of that waiting room are filled not only with medically unwell patients but also with those fleeing domestic violence, those at risk of homelessness and those who just have nowhere else to go. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in resus, return of spontaneous circulation has occurred, and his heart is now beating properly again. This patient needs to be transferred to the intensive care unit for critical care, but there are no beds. The stroke and the heart attack need immediate attention, but there are no beds—no beds and not enough staff. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While all of this is occurring, others come through the door: the five-month-old child with a femoral fracture as a result of domestic violence; the 17-year-old in crisis due to a deterioration of their mental health; and the 80-year-old presenting unwell—someone's mother—and yours will be the last hand they ever hold. The people that come through the door on their feet, in a chair or in the arms of a loved one all know one thing: that we will be there for them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The emergency department, however, can surprise you. It can be a place of love and a place of new life: the healthy baby boy born in the resus bay; that Saturday sporting injury that, after an X-ray, turned out not to be a fracture; and the child presenting in the middle of the night as unwell, who just needed an ice block, some medicine and lots of hugs from mum and dad. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shifts like this formed a turning point for me. I stand before you today not because I no longer want to be a doctor—I love being a doctor, and I will always love being a doctor—but because, by undertaking this most important role, my skills and my experience will no longer be limited to the bedside. At the bedside, I have the opportunity to help one family at a time. Here, in this place, I have the opportunity to be part of something that can change the lives of everyone in our community for the better. I have the opportunity to use my experiences to bring about informed systemic change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people come through the doors of the hospital, they put their absolute trust in those caring for them. They know that you will do your absolute best for them against all odds. The decisions that you make will make a difference in their life and for their life. And that is what I want to help bring to this place. The public must be able to trust us. We have been given an incredible honour of representing our communities, and the people need to know, and need the guarantee, that they can trust us to do the right thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will fight day and night to ensure that those in power—every person in this place, including myself—are held to account, because the health of our nation depends on it. A healthy democracy has at its core accountability, and I see it as my responsibility—in fact, our responsibility—to ensure that we safeguard and protect it for future generations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government developing the nation's first independent anti-corruption commission is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle in restoring the community's faith and trust in their elected representatives. Our future generations should be at the heart of every decision we make. Without them, we are nothing, and this great Australian story ceases to exist. Therefore, we must provide them with an environment, with a planet where they can continue to grow, to love and to become whoever they want to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the afternoon, with the sun setting and an orange glow filling the sky, if you look out from Umina Beach, you will see a small island, Lion Island, and on it a colony of penguins. Surrounding it and the remaining coast are rolling waves and rolling ocean teeming with marine life. It is truly something beautiful to behold. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The scene I describe is not that dissimilar to many parts of Australia, although the peninsula is truly one of the greatest places on the face of this earth, but it places front and centre what we must do—protect, preserve and nurture. I want to see a world where our policy brings people and business into the future and where Australia becomes an environmental and climate superpower benefiting us all. To improve the health of our climate and environment is what my father would describe as a generational project. We must leave things better and stronger for future generations—for our family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many families across this country and across my electorate, own and operate small businesses, which are the backbone of this nation. To have a small business is not to just have holidays when you want or to have an easy life, like some people believe. It is to risk everything because you want to aspire to something better, to provide for your family, and to have the capacity and ability to provide local jobs for local people. That is small business, and Labor supports it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For myself, family is everything, as is my community. Part of that story is my nan, Aunty Robyn Reid, an incredible Aboriginal elder and leader. Nan has spent every waking moment being part of and supporting the local Aboriginal community on the Central Coast, and I am so proud to be a part of that. One of seven children, she spent her childhood in what was inhumanely branded 'the camps'. Nan grew up where severe abuse and poverty were the norm. The threat of not sleeping or of not living somewhere safe and secure was real. The threat of not eating was real. But she was able to escape this cycle with social housing—in Newtown, in fact. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision of social housing, which my nan refers to, to this day, as a blessing, was a pivotal opportunity in her life—an opportunity that gave her safety, security and support to strive for something even bigger. With her perseverance and incredible resilience, she was able to go on to be the first person in her family to own her own home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My nan loves being able to use her story to help support and inspire members of our local Aboriginal community and let them know that, if they are struggling, they have the whole community behind them supporting them. I am so proud of my Aboriginal heritage and couldn't be prouder of the incredible role that my nan plays in our local community as a strong female Indigenous elder. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every person deserves the right to have a secure roof over their head, and I will endeavour to ensure that those sitting in the emergency department waiting room, those on our streets and those at risk of homelessness have just that. A nation's health depends on its ability to care for its most vulnerable, and Labor's housing vision is part of the therapy that's needed to resuscitate our social and affordable housing right across the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our movement, the Labor movement, has always been one of opportunity and access. Whether it be the health of our loved ones, the education of our people, the acknowledgement of the past, housing our most vulnerable, making sure employment becomes more secure, or the expansion and modernisation of our economy, our movement is one that has and will continue to improve the lives of all Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the pillars of the Labor Party, and they are the foundations of our society and they are who I am. As your member for Robertson, I will work to protect our most vulnerable, to grow our region and to unite our community, because together we are healthier, together we are better, and together we are stronger.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  Wentworth, thank you for electing me to this place. It is an enormous honour to represent you here. Our community is passionate in its support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, so let me acknowledge the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, who are the traditional owners of the Canberra area, as well as the Gadigal people of the Eora nation, who are the traditional custodians of Wentworth, and pay my respects to their elders, past, present and emerging. My community and I are passionate about voice, truth and treaty as embodied in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, and it would be my profound honour to contribute to achieving those goals in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every story starts with family. Some in this room knew my mother, Carla Zampatti. Many of you knew her designs. If she were still alive today, she would be delighted to see so many women in the House and that so many of them have worn her clothes in the last week. Thank you, all. She was an Italian immigrant. Her father left his pregnant wife in Europe to come to Australia to seek a better life. He was interned as an enemy alien during the war. My mother didn't meet her father until 1950, when she walked off the docks in Fremantle. Mum didn't speak English when she arrived. She left school at 14. She started her business in her 20s, when women didn't really run businesses. She got divorced when she had a nine-month-old baby and had to restart her business when women still didn't really run businesses and weren't really single mums. She was a champion of women, migrants and the arts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, Mum's life represents the Australian dream. She taught me many things. She gave me her migrant values. She made sure my siblings and I knew that we had to earn our place in the world through hard work and never taking anything for granted. She showed me that, it doesn't matter where you come from, everyone can make an enormous contribution and that social mobility, the freedom to become, is the best thing about this country. She told me that as a woman I should and could do anything I wanted and not to feel guilty about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's my father, John Spender, who so wished he could be here today. He was a member of this Australian parliament, as his father was. From Dad I received a passionate interest in ideas, learning and understanding how the world is governed and the high honour and responsibility of public service. He taught me to think independently, even if it makes you unpopular. He took that from his father, who in turn also served in parliament. He was Sir Percy Spender. He was the son of a locksmith and he was significantly responsible for both the Colombo Plan, Australia's first turn to Asia, and the ANZUS treaty, Australia's most enduring alliance. He stood for the future, not the past. Many claim him as a party man and as a Liberal Party leading light—and he was—but his first loyalty was to what is right. He first stood for parliament as a sort of Independent in the seat of Warringah. He stood against the defence minister of the day because he disagreed with the defence policy and he decided that the best way to change it was to stand up—and he won the seat. And he continued to stand against his party when he felt that the party was in conflict with the national interest. I speak of him because of what he means to me but also because of what his example means to this House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the gallery are my siblings—my brother, Alex, and my sister, Bianca. I love debating Alex, and if he was in this parliament he would be firmly over there on those benches. And Bianca is simply the most wonderful sister anyone could have. Finally is my family that we created: Mark, my husband, who loves me better when my hair is frizzy and I don't have any make-up on, who gives me great advice even when I ignore it, and my wonderful children, Arietta, Octavia and Rafferty. I am eternally grateful for your love and care. I'm here because I want your future to be better for the choices made here in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My family values have had a significant influence on my career. I started working in my family business at the age of 10. I'm sorry, Minister Burke; this is just how family businesses operate! I only truly left it when I stood for this election. I love the dynamism and freedom that comes from business, how you can find new ways of solving problems. But my passions have always been greater than business. That is why I first studied economics—because I wanted to understand how public policy works and how it impacts on the lives of people. It's why I worked in the UK Treasury, where I felt that government policy was so far away from the people it was meant to help, and then in the UK public teaching hospital, and it is there that I learned and focused on how to improve quality of care without necessarily increasing costs. I've never forgotten those lessons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My career has taught me how business and social impact can work together to solve big problems, from my time at Sydney Renewable Power Company to my time in Kenya working with rural farmers and finally to my time at the Australian Business and Community Network, where volunteers from business mentored thousands of kids from low-socioeconomic schools about the world of work. Those kids were like my mum, without a lot of material advantages but with so much to bring to this country if we support them. It was the best job I've ever had. Your family gives you your values, and your career lets you live them. But they're not the reason why I am here. I am here because my community, Wentworth, sent me here to represent their values in parliament. I want to acknowledge those who came before me: Dave Sharma, who worked very hard in the community; Kerryn Phelps, a trailblazer female Independent who stood for humane treatment of refugees; and, of course, the former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. These are enormous shoes to fill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wentworth is known for its beaches, our harbour, our green spaces, but those images don't actually capture the community of Wentworth. It's the community that makes it so special: like Todd and Trent, who founded the 440 Run Club—it's called that because you have to get up at 4.40 on a Saturday morning to help young people reduce alcohol consumption and improve their mental health; like Henry, who invented a film that you can put on planes—it's literally like covering them with contact to reduce drag, to reduce fuel consumption, to reduce greenhouse gases and actually to grow local high-tech jobs; like the wonderful locals at ACON and Waverley council who worked to deliver the new memorial to gay hate crime victims in Marks Park; like Kitty Clark, the director of the gallery Saint Cloche, who galvanised a local arts community into fundraising thousands for the victims of war in Ukraine; like the Holocaust survivor Eddie Jaku, who recently passed and is much missed—he advocated for kindness and compassion out of the world's worst genocide; and finally like Sean, who I met in Bondi one day pushing his daughter on a tricycle. I asked him, 'What do you care about?’ He said: 'I care about the environment. I love the beaches and I want this for my kids. I want a kind society. I want us to treat people well. Finally, I'm a small-business owner, and that's the most important thing for me.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's Wentworth. We care about the environment. We love the natural world and we carry in our hearts the responsibility to pass it to our children. Our community is kind, compassionate and inclusive. We voted for marriage equality in overwhelming numbers. We are passionate advocates for refugees. We have Australia's largest Jewish community and many treasured Holocaust survivors in that community. Many of us came to Australia to seek a better life. We are entrepreneurial, we are innovative and we are businesslike. We work across technology, in finance, in arts, in medicine, in caring for others and in teaching. We expect the government to use our money wisely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to those people who sent me here. When I first was approached by community members about running I said no, but I couldn't let it go. Saying yes was the hardest decision I have ever made. I have a young family, I had a job I adored and I used to have an Italian passport. But I said yes because our values were not represented in this parliament. I said yes because I watched with despair the former government go to COP26 with the position that our businesses, our scientists, our community did not support. They did not stand for us, for Wentworth, and I could not stand aside any longer. This was the moment to say we can do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people ask me if it was hard to stand against my family's Liberal tradition. There are those who try to paint me and other Independents gathered here today as radical. I said to them: protecting our environment for our children is not a radical choice; ensuring that our businesses are at the forefront of innovation is not a radical choice; making sure that our institutions have integrity, transparency and accountability is not a radical choice; and having equal representation of women and men in public life is not a radical choice. We are the values of modern Australia, and to truly stand up for them requires unprecedented community action, and I want to pay tribute to those who contributed to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our first event, when hundreds of people came together at Paddington RSL on a typically rainy Saturday, was the first taste of the commitment our community was willing to make to change, and the community grew from there. At first, people took a brochure. They may have worn a cap. They put a dog bandana on their puppy. They wore a T-shirt. Then they found themselves dropping off leaflets, standing on street corners, talking to their neighbours about politics when they have never done that before. Then they were making a line of signs, one kilometre long, waving to the people of Wentworth as they drove to the city. How did it happen? It happened because good people stood up and lived the words that we need to be the change we want to see in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to those who approached me and those who supported me, particularly—this is a long list and I know I'm going to forget someone—Lyndell, Anthony, Daniel, Maria, Michaels, Davids, Alexa, Ed, Kath, Sarah, Traceys, Alex, Ruby, Max, Charlotte, Joe, Fred, Kerry, Margots, Andrews, Ians, Sigrid, Louise, JulieAnne, Jillian, Tim, John, Wendys, Ken, Jonathan, Nick, Desiree—I promise haven't just taken a baby list!—Heather, Ella, Peter, Margriet, Martin, Sally, Steve, Annettes, Catherine, Karen, Daniella, Ramazan, Eliana, Jack, Lynn, Marianne, Matthew, Michelle, Mike, Pam, Patricia. Thank you. You were wonderful!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to my wonderful friends and family who supported me in this choice, and thank you to the thousands of people who supported, volunteered and donated. You are the change that created this. I'm the vehicle of the ambitions of our community to have a voice that truly represents our community in parliament. My first loyalty is to the people of Wentworth, to represent you and your values, not a party. But I know that Wentworth wants me to focus on the best interests of Australia as well, as these people care for the whole country and not just our own patch. For our times are not easy, and it is the values of Wentworth and all the Australian people that are needed now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have so much to be thankful for. We are the most successful multicultural country on this earth. We have the longest continuous civilisation on this earth. We have abundant resources. We are educated. We are healthy. The Australian dream is still meaningful here. And we are irreverent. And yet we face significant challenges. There are global challenges: climate change, Ukraine war, shifting global power dynamics, the pandemic. There are local challenges: low productivity, inflation, cost of living, mental health, government debt, a world where young people's real wages are going backwards and housing is out of their reach. And there are challenges to our own values. How do we humanely treat refugees and asylum seekers? How do we achieve a makarrata to truly bring reconciliation to our country? How do we bring respect, safety and equality to all women? And how do we support and include all Australians in our future?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will stand with Wentworth for the future of this country, not the past. I will stand with Wentworth for strong climate action in this decade and beyond, for a more ambitious climate change action than the government has put forward—one that is informed by the science and works collaboratively with business, unions, community and government to achieve; one that underpins our national security through a reduction of foreign oil. I will stand with Wentworth for investing in our democracy and in this parliament. That means a strong federal ICAC, that means support for ABC and SBS, that means donation reform and that means an end to pork-barrelling. But it also means challenging this parliament to behave better because we do not behave like this in our living rooms, in our workplaces. I am yet to meet a member of the public who thinks the pointscoring football match of question time is actually helping our country be governed better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will stand with Wentworth for a future focused economy. We need to listen to business about migration, about getting the skills we need into this country. We need to listen about innovation. We need to listen about how to help Australia lead R&amp;D, not lag. And we need to listen to businesses about regulation. We absolutely must protect our workers and the environment but we need to do this in a way that still allows business to focus on its customers, its suppliers and its people, not to be tied up in government complexity and red tape. I will stand with Wentworth for the tough decisions in government for the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My mum almost went out of business in the late eighties, and she taught me that spending more money doesn't always equal better. But both sides of politics so often signal their commitment to issues with dollar signs. In business, if you spend more money and you don't get results, your budget gets cut. We are spending more money in education and in health, and we are going backwards. We must engage with the states in the harder task of reform. We must always remember that this isn't our money. We are taking it out of the pockets of families that need it. And they need it now more than ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a tax system that holds us back, stamp duty that imposes costs on housing, a payroll tax that is a tax on working—a tax system that doesn't drive productivity. It's not fit for purpose. The economists know it. The business community knows it. The social sector knows it. But neither party wants to deal with the real challenges that we face there. And we must face those hard questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will stand with Wentworth for young people, because all the generations of Wentworth are concerned that homeownership for young people is slipping out of reach. The hard choices of increasing housing supply and reforming stamp duty must be addressed. I will stand for education and for truly preparing young people for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will stand with Wentworth for bringing the kindness and compassion that we show in our private lives back into parliament in how we treat our most vulnerable—in how we treat our refugees and asylum seekers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, finally, I will stand with Wentworth for women. I am the daughter of a female trailblazer. I am a feminist. I am the mother of girls. And, if nothing else, I am one piece of a transformational change in the balance of this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to the others who are part of this incredible wave of change—the women and multicultural people who have come into this parliament and made it the closest that the Australian parliament has ever had to true representation. I pay tribute to my fellow Independents, those in the parliament now but also those in the past, the brave women who have said: 'Enough is enough in stale old politics.' It will be my lifelong honour to stand in the class of 2022 with you all and seek the change that our communities sent us to pursue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I will say to the coalition: in 1996, you actually led the parliament in terms of women. Twenty-three per cent of women in the lower house were women in 1996, in the coalition. After this last election, it was 19 per cent. In 25 years, it has never got above 25 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women will be represented. We have been polite, we have asked nicely and we have waited. But we've done waiting, and we're going to take what is ours. This crossbench reflects this. Ignore it at your peril.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let this parliament be the one that ends the politics of waste. I do not want to waste the potential of so many women by not allowing them to work. I do not want to waste the potential of so many young people who are locked out of opportunities in this country. I do not want to waste the economic opportunity of decarbonisation for this country. And I do not want to waste the precious world that we've been given.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand in the middle of parliament because this is where the people of our country stand—in the middle. They stand for balance. They stand for difference, but not division. They want us to be builders, not wreckers. They want us to find solutions, not finger-point. You can be pro environment and pro business. You can live in the city and care about the country. You can be economically responsible and compassionate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One final thing—I will confess to you: I will make mistakes in this parliament. No doubt I will disappoint some people. But the one thing I will do is listen to my community. When I falter, I know you will be there. You will tell me the truth. I feel the weight of responsibility for the woman who came out of the polling booth with tears in her eyes and said to me: 'My daughter had anorexia and couldn't get the care she needed. I voted for you. Make a difference.' I feel the weight of responsibility for 17-year-old Millie, who said: 'I've always wanted to go into politics, but I never saw anyone I wanted to be. But now I have.' I will seek to be worthy of your trust. I will carry you in my heart. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHANDLER-</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">MATHER</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  Thanks, Deputy Speaker. Since the invasion of this continent, generations of First Nations warriors, organisers and leaders have fought, and continue to fight, to protect their lands, seas, air, people and culture against colonisation. I would like to pay homage to them, in particular the Yuggera and Turrbal peoples, who are the traditional owners of so-called Brisbane and my electorate of Griffith, and the traditional owners of this place, the Ngunnawal people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with so many issues in this place, there is often a deep hypocrisy when it comes to the way some politicians talk about First Nations people. How often are we told that governments support the rights of First Nations people but then fail to introduce the 339 recommendations of the Aboriginal deaths in custody royal commission, over 30 years after they were handed down? Or allow coal and gas mines to open up on land, often against the express wishes of traditional owners? While billions of dollars of mining revenue flow offshore into the coffers of billionaires, First Nations people too often lack basic health care, housing, education and incomes. Politicians make decisions that destroy First Nations land and then write laws that allow their corporate donors to rob their wealth and put it in the hands of people like Gina Rinehart. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is abundantly clear to me that billionaires and big corporations run parliament. Indeed, when it comes to representation, I imagine that people like Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart must feel pretty good that sometimes it feels as though 89 per cent of this place ultimately represent their interests. The major parties have proved often willing to accept an enormous human and environmental cost in order to serve the interests of big corporations and billionaires, such is their power over this place. Three million Australians live in poverty, with millions more on the brink, while Australia's richest 200 people just ticked over half a trillion dollars worth of wealth. Our nurses, teachers and doctors are viciously overworked, just to make up for the chronic underfunding of our public hospitals and schools. Meanwhile, the next federal budget will include billions of dollars in subsidies for fossil fuel corporations that just happen to be making record profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the middle of one of the worst housing affordability crises in our history, where single mums are forced to live on the street after massive rent hikes, the big four banks just announced $14 billion in after-tax profit. Close to a million people are on the waiting list for social housing, suffering severe private rental stress or homelessness, but 89 per cent of this place would rather support billions of dollars in tax concessions for property investors than even contemplate capping rents or building enough public housing for those who need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighty-nine per cent of this parliament literally supports spending $224 billion giving every politician and billionaire an extra $9,000 a year in the form of the stage 3 tax cuts. But apparently bringing dental into Medicare is too expensive. Apparently, scrapping crippling student debt and making uni and TAFE free is too expensive. Apparently, building enough beautifully designed public housing so everyone has a place to call home costs too much. Apparently, raising JobSeeker and the pension above the poverty line so people don't have to live in abject poverty is too expensive. The top 10 per cent of Australians now hold over half the total wealth in this country, but apparently that 10 per cent need a massive tax cut. Truly, one of life's great mysteries is why people don't like politicians!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the worst things about Australian politics is the way it works to make some of the greatest injustices and outrages seem perfectly normal and reasonable. Like a sedative it dulls the senses, and it relies on a certain logic. What is considered possible isn't determined by what actually is possible with the resources our country has to hand, but instead the major parties, media and various public and private institutions work to constrain the scope of political debate into an ever-narrowing band—one determined not by what everyday people want, need or believe but by the interests of the billionaires and multinational corporations that parliament ultimately serves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This logic is perhaps best exemplified when it comes to climate change. The consequences of two degrees or more of global warming are so devastating it's actually quite hard to explain, but the recent devastating bushfires, floods, heatwaves, droughts and storms really are only a small preview—massive crop failures, sea level rises displacing hundreds of millions of people, 99 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef lost. A recent study found that in 30 years time my home town of Brisbane could be virtually unliveable in summer for those who can't afford air-conditioning. But over two degrees of warming is exactly what 89 per cent of this place supports. In fact, currently this place supports expanding coal and gas mining and using public money to do it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels in the world behind two great countries it's really good to be a part of: Russia and Saudi Arabia—great company! The idea that the moderate position on climate change is, 'Use public money to expand coal and gas mining and drive global warming beyond two degrees,' only makes sense when you consider that the power holders in parliament are coal and gas corporations, not everyday people. It's like standing in front of a burning house and declaring that the moderate position is 'We only put the fire out in one room while we send someone out back with a can of petrol to pour fuel on the fire.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most insulting lie, I think, though, when it comes to climate change, is that Australia needs to expand coal and gas mining to protect workers. That would be more believable if the political establishment didn't also believe that workers should pay more tax than the multinational corporations they work for. But the reality is that over the next 10 years coal and gas corporations will export hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars of our wealth—our wealth. That's more than enough not just to guarantee the jobs and income of every coal and gas worker but to ensure every regional mining community becomes a thriving hub of publicly owned manufacturing, renewable energy and new industries, with good hospitals, schools, public facilities and housing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would argue the political establishment doesn't give a toss about workers. What they're really worried about is the profits of their donors. The political system is so completely disconnected from the lives of everyday people. In fact, spending only a week in this place has been a stark lesson in how so much of the pomp, ceremony and rules of this place work to deepen and reinforce that disconnection. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Literally this same week that the Business Council was holding a special event in Parliament House with the Prime Minister—we walked past, and it was frankly bizarre—children peacefully calling for action on climate change were dragged out by police. Technically, I should be kicked out of parliament if I don't dress like a businessman, but you're more than welcome to vote for laws that materially benefit corporations that also happen to donate millions of dollars to your political party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every member of parliament was forced to pledge allegiance to the British monarch last week. One would think we should be swearing allegiance to the Australian people. Then there was the installing of massive security fences around the once publicly accessible lawns above Parliament House that were specifically designed to represent the democratically accessible nature of this place. As symbols go, I think that was probably a bit on the nose. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sense that politics and politicians in general are completely disconnected from the lives of everyday people was a sentiment shared by almost everyone I spoke to during this campaign. Over 14 months, I personally knocked on almost 15,000 doors, or thereabouts, and time and again people told me they were fed up with politics. But what also became clear was just how low people's expectations are when it comes to politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this sense of low expectations which remains one of the political establishment's greatest assets. Deny people hope that things can get substantially better and you take their power, but I've seen the power of collective hope. Indeed, it really is the only reason I'm standing here. Over 14 months, over 1,000 Greens volunteers in Griffith knocked on almost 90,000 doors, hand-delivered hundreds of thousands of letters and flyers and gave up countless, evenings, mornings, rainy arvos and weekends to fight for something greater than themselves. We had tens of thousands of conversations with residents across Griffith where we actually took the time to listen and, often, learn about the issues that people faced in their daily lives. Together we built the single biggest single-seat campaign, I would argue, in the history of Australian politics and helped continue to build a movement inextricably linked to the communities from which it has emerged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the questions I asked repeatedly on the Griffith campaign, borrowed from Bernie Sanders, was: are you willing to fight for someone you don't know as hard as you would fight for yourself? Time and again the answer was yes. We fought for each other not out of a sense of charity but out of a sense of solidarity, of righteous anger and, most importantly, of hope—hope not that we could defy virtually every political and media expert and win in Griffith but that we could collectively build a movement that would fundamentally transform Australian politics in favour of everyday people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The philosophy of organisation of our movement was perhaps best represented by the response to the Brisbane floods. The floods of this year were a harsh, brutal and unjust symbol of the consequences of a political system stacked in favour of fossil fuel corporations. This apparent one-in-500-year event occurred just 10 years after another one-in-100-year flood—an alarming demonstration of the corporate and political grip on climate change. The slow response from emergency services and government was a consequence of decades of the hollowing out and underfunding of our public services and institutions. The disproportionate number of low-income and middle-income renters and homeowners badly affected by the floods were a reminder that, while this housing crisis is caused by a system treats housing as a commodity first and a home last, climate change will make it worse. But, as in Lismore, where incredible resident self-organisation drove a collective clean-up, in Griffith we proved that, where a broken system fails, ordinary people step in to fill the breach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of those weeks, we suspended our campaign and, along with the brilliant member for South Brisbane, Amy MacMahon; Councillor Jonathan Sri; and their brilliant teams and officers, we used our organisational and logistical capacity to coordinate hundreds of volunteers in delivering free food, ice and eskies for those who had lost power. We taxied residents to crucial services. We cleaned up entire neighbourhood blocks, hauling flood damaged furniture, cleaning houses and sometimes just providing a shoulder to cry on. But it wasn't just the floods. We coordinated protests against worsening flight noise pollution, planted community gardens and used the produce to provide free food to those trapped in COVID isolation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, I believe, you build power by acting collectively as a community. If we want to take on the power of billionaires and big corporations then we must build a party and a movement that is capable of improving people's lives outside the cycle of electoral politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when it comes to this movement and, in particular, to our success in Griffith, there are some people who need thanking. To the thousands of volunteers, donors and supporters: I was constantly inspired by your drive, commitment and perseverance. Indeed, in many a dark moment on that campaign, the only thing that got me up in the morning was imagining one of you rocking up with a smile on your face to the fifth door-knock of that weekend, not demonstrating one ounce of fatigue. Frankly, I don't know how they did it. My brilliant campaign team is, I would argue, the best campaign to member country. Liam Flenady, Mel McAuliffe, Nat Baker, Lachlan Morris, Claire Hudson, Louisa Randal, Eva Tolo, Josh Saunders-Mills, James Cummins, Kelsey Waller, Paul Rees, Zoe Lawrence, Heather Bennett, and Hannah Wright.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Kitty Carra, the often unacknowledged director of the Queensland Greens, who has overseen the most successful period in the history of our party. She both procreated the space for and led many of transformations in the Queensland Greens that have led to so much success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Adam Bandt and his chief of staff Damien Lawson: thanks for believing in and supporting our little movement in Queensland years before any other southerner gave us a shot!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to my parents, Kim and Tim, for giving me many of the principles of right and wrong that I still hold today while providing the space to develop my own politics with guidance and the odd radical book recommendation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my partner, Joanna, without whom there's no way I could have survived this campaign: I love you and I can't imagine life without you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, to the people of Griffith, thank you for your trust not just in me but in our broader Greens' movement. To you I give you this commitment: whether you're struggling to put food on the table or pay the rent, whether you're a refugee in hotel detention in Kangaroo Point or you're facing eviction from your public housing, whether you're fighting against a profit-hungry airport corporation or a dodgy developer, whether you want to help plant a community garden or just fix up your local school, whether you have been abandoned by state authorities as another climate fuelled flood disaster hits your neighbourhood or you are just in need of a friendly chat, we will have your back</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Really, at the end of the day what we are fighting for is a future where everyone has what they need to live a good life. Perhaps the greatest injustice of all is that in such a wealthy country our system denies so many people the chance to fully enjoy their one short life on this earth. Health care; education; housing; a good, well-paying job and a beautiful home are the foundation to do what makes life truly meaningful: time with family and friends, footy in the park, painting a picture, reading a book, a day at the beach, a hike through the wilderness, a beer at the pub. I so strongly believe in a four-day work week with no loss of pay, because it would do so much to give people that most precious of resources: time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond all the specifics it can sometimes be hard to describe what exactly we mean by a good life. Funnily enough, the great feminist writer Virginia Woolf's writing in 'A room of one's own', for me, comes close to describing what I mean. Woolf reflects on the instinct for possession; the rage for acquisition, which keeps, 'the stockbroker and the great barrister going indoors to make money and more money and more money when it is a fact that 500 pounds a year will keep one alive in the sunshine'. With that 500 pounds, she wrote, came the freedom to think and write as she pleased. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So often in political debates we reduce people to numbers, but what value do you put on a family no longer having to worry about paying the rent and finally having the money to spend the summer at the beach? What value do you put on an afternoon playing footy in the park with your kids rather than working a sixth day of work? How much human enjoyment, creativity, new loves and friendships are denied by a political and an economic system that too often prioritises the profit of multinational corporations over the happiness of everyday people?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has given me so much hope is that the vast majority of everyday people across Australia share this vision that we should tax billionaires and big corporations to fund things like dental into Medicare and free child care, and build one million public and affordable homes. It is a view that I believe is shared by the vast majority of people across this country. What's more, it is a truly universal vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That a small town in regional Queensland, Biloela, demonstrated a greater level of kindness and solidarity towards refugees than this place has done in decades is a reminder that while the decisions this place makes often impose unimaginable cruelty on people fleeing persecution, war and famine—often created by the foreign policy decisions of our government—those decisions don't reflect the will of the people. After all, what sort of good life is it when our country demonises and mandatorily imprisons our brothers and sisters for the crime of seeking that same good life?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I have so much hope that ultimately we can win, because no matter what the political establishment throws at us, no matter how many times they tell us not to hope for anything better, no matter how many times they try to divide us up, no matter how many millions of corporate dollars they spend trying to stop us, we'll keep fighting, because we recognise that we all have more in common with a refugee in detention than a billionaire like Clive Palmer. We don't fight for self-interest; we fight for each other. And we won't stop until everyone—everyone—has what they need to live a good life, to be alive in the sunshine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those watching at home who despair at the state of our world but feel powerless to change it, I understand. After all, how often are we browbeaten and lectured about expecting anything but the bare minimum from politics? Often by self-proclaimed experts. But here's the thing, I've lost count of the number of times political and media experts said we had absolutely no chance of winning Griffith. And the thing is that they were wrong and people like you were right: the cleaners, paramedics, nurses, students, tradies, retirees, refugees. Ordinary, everyday people who fought every day for a better future on the Griffith campaign were right, and the representatives of the political establishment were wrong. Believe me that knowledge terrifies them. So next time an expert or politician tells you that it's unrealistic to expect that in a wealthy country like Australia no-one should go hungry or without a home, know that we were right and they were wrong. Know that when they tell you that tax cuts for billionaires, more coal and gas, and mandatory detention of refugees is the best you can hope for, they were wrong. If the Greens' wins in Brisbane, Ryan and Griffith prove one thing, it is that the only barrier—the only barrier—to change is our capacity to organise campaigns like this around the country. Our collective power terrifies the major parties and corporate donors, but it should give you hope, because the Griffith campaign wasn't the end of something but the start. And if our political establishment thinks that this is our movement at our biggest, that somehow this is the best that we can do, then, oh boy, do they have another think coming! We really are just getting started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So if, like me, you think that we should use $224 billion providing free breakfast in every school so no kid goes hungry rather than dishing out $9,000 to a federal politician; if you think everyone deserves a good home; if you think we shouldn't divide people up by the colour of their skin, gender, sexuality or the way they talk, but rather find common cause with everyone in this country who has been screwed over by the political system; and if you think that tackling climate change is more important than the share price of BHP, then join our movement, because I have seen the power of collective hope and I know what it can achieve. Thank you.</span>

                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  I stand here as a member of the 47th Parliament because a majority of people in the Makin electorate once again placed their trust and their faith in me to continue as their representative in the federal parliament. To those people I say thank you; I will continue to do all that I can to live up to your expectations and to be an effective representative for all people in the Makin electorate and beyond. To be a member of federal parliament is indeed a privilege that comes with considerable responsibility. I particularly thank the people who not only voted for me but who personally volunteered their time to campaign for me—again, not just in the election campaign but for years, many of them leading up to this last election. They are what Paul Keating once referred to as the 'true believers'. They worked unselfishly for the election of me and a Labor government—a Labor government with policies and laws built on a belief in justice, fairness and equality for all, and a belief in a society where freedom, democracy and inclusion are not just words but core principles of the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I especially thank the people closest to me in my everyday life who sacrifice so much of their own lives and their time to support me in what I do in this place. I refer particularly to my wife, Vicki, who has always been there for me throughout all of my time in public life—from, indeed, the day we got married—to my children and their families, and to all my other extended family members who, along with my very loyal and very confident office team, share the joys, the stresses and the sacrifices of political life. Politics can be tough and often thankless, and, as so many others—including the colleagues from the 46th Parliament who were unsuccessful in the May election—find out, being in politics can in fact do a lot to change who you are as a person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia being part of a global community means that we are directly impacted by so much of what takes place across the world: wars, internal conflicts, extreme weather events or disruption to peace and harmony anywhere in the rest of the world will inevitably have consequences for Australia in the form of trade difficulties and disruptions; import shortages; price increases; humanitarian assistance that is required; refugee issues; and the like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a global community, Australia's national interest doesn't stop at our international border. That is why it is so important that from the first day after the 21 May election Prime Minister Albanese and his senior ministers have set out to rebuild Australia's damaged relationships with other countries, including many of our near neighbours who for so long have been neglected. Australia has its own identity and independence, but we do live within a global economy and we are members of an international community that today is confronted with so many difficult issues. Yes, it would be fair to say that the world has always faced difficult issues, some greater and others lesser than the difficulties of today, but, notwithstanding that—whatever those difficulties were—it is the immediate issues that this generation faces that become priorities for our government and for other governments around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia and throughout the world the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted normal life as we knew it and exposed our national vulnerabilities. The Australian idiom 'She'll be right, mate' went out the window with COVID. We saw lives lost and many people hospitalised. Jobs were lost, services were cut and global supply chains were derailed. Medical services were stressed—and we heard a brilliant speech about that earlier this evening. Work practices changed. Immigration and travel became chaotic, and the global economy became unstable and insecure. I could go on, and I'm sure members in this place are very familiar with all of the issues that COVID brought about. Indeed, it was an experience I don't think anybody ever forecast or imagined would happen in their own lifetime, where we saw the world turned upside down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, in response to the COVID pandemic, the Morrison coalition sidelined, ignored and even denied its responsibilities on so many of the matters that were core responsibilities of government. It simply tried to use COVID as an excuse for not being able to get on with the full job of government. In fact, some of the problems that we are confronted with today in Australia arose because of the negligence of the Morrison, Turnbull and Abbott governments. These are pressing issues which the Australian people, however, did not forget about and which influenced their vote on 21 May—issues which resulted in a change of government, which saw people looking for a new and fresh direction, which saw the Australian people put their faith and their trust in a brand new government. There was the Morrison government's indifference to climate change, where the government was completely out of step with global, political, business and community opinion; the human crisis in the aged-care sector, so well exposed by the royal commission and some 20 earlier inquiries; and the neglect of the environment, as revealed by the government's deliberate withholding of the <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the environment</span> report. The Morrison government presided over a failing national health and NDIS system and constantly white-anted Medicare. Then there was its complete botching of the replacement submarine program, where we wasted not only a decade of time but over $5 billion in public funds. It presided over the demise of our skills training and the national TAFE system. It talked the talk but didn't walk the walk in support of veterans, then had to be dragged into a royal commission into veterans' suicides. And Mr Morrison presided over a government racked by rorts, incompetence and dishonesty while, not surprisingly, refusing to establish an effective anticorruption commission. These things were all part of the reason why the Australian people looked for change and marked down the previous Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other issues raised with me in the course of the election campaign that didn't form part of the Governor-General's address when he gave it last week. The Governor-General highlighted, I believe, most of the commonplace policy areas that this government acknowledges it needs to respond to. But there were indeed many other issues raised with me, which I want to quickly talk about in the time that I have left. I refer to things such as corporate greed; private health cover, where our private health system is beginning to fail the people that are members of that system; environmental degradation, which I referred to briefly earlier on; the public ownership of essential services; a struggling health system; the absence of dental cover in Medicare; restoring public trust and confidence in parliamentarians and the parliamentary process; the energy crisis, which we talk about almost daily; and the release of Julian Assange. In talking on those matters—and I will make much more in-depth remarks about all of them in this 47th Parliament when the appropriate time arises—I simply want to make these brief points.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the COVID pandemic of the last 2½ years, whilst businesses were closing, Australian people were losing their jobs, and families around the country were struggling; we saw corporate businesses making superprofits, profits above and beyond what they had previously made when the economy was supposedly going so well. We saw them also taking handouts from government, to the tune of around $20 billion, perhaps even more, when their own income was increasing. It is a concern when we have an economy where that kind of behaviour is allowed to continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I touched on the issue of private health cover. I read, only a couple of weeks ago, about how the private health sector is in crisis. We know that the health system more broadly is in crisis. If people do not have confidence in their private health cover—and they don't, because of the gap payments that they are being forced to pay—that will simply force them into the public system, and that will only put more pressure on the public system, and, in turn, the cycle of a public health system that is struggling to meet its obligations will continue. Indeed, in the last two or three weeks alone, in my office I have had several people come to me and say, 'My private health cover simply doesn't give me the support that I need to be able to get the health support that I need, and so therefore I need to go to the public system or we need to change the rules around the private health system.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Environmental degradation is something that I have spoken out about in this place from the day I came into this parliament. We had a report that was put on ice by the previous government so it wouldn't be exposed in the lead-up to the last election, and that is unforgivable. I have spoken to environmentalists back in my home state of South Australia, people who know what they are doing and people who have committed their lives to supporting our environment. The environmental degradation that is taking place in Australia and around the world is something that cannot continue. Australia does not have a proud track record of environmental protection, and it is something that I will continue to fight hard for again in this term of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the issue of public ownership of essential services. It has been exposed time and time again, including throughout the COVID pandemic, that outsourcing essential services means that, when things go wrong, it is the government that has to pick up the pieces, and ultimately the people of Australia pay for that outsourcing. So what might appear to be short-term savings up-front ultimately end up being major costs to the broader community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Others have spoken about—and I have also raised it on previous occasions—the absence of dental cover in Medicare. It is something that I believe should be included and should have been included from day one. I've said that previously. I would like to ultimately see that as something that we pursue. I understand that you can only do so much, but, one step at a time, we should be heading in that direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, others have spoken about the need to restore public trust and confidence in our parliamentarians. Labor's commitment to a national integrity commission, I believe, will go a long way towards doing that, but we also need to change the way we behave in this place and some of the practices of this parliament. The public have every right to be critical of what they have seen over recent years. I believe that the reality is that people come into this place with good intentions to do the best they can for the communities that they represent, and we need to work collectively to ensure that this parliament does indeed work for the betterment of the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few moments I have left, the last two points I will touch on are the energy crisis and Julian Assange. Australian people simply do not accept that Australia, as one of the world's large exporters of coal and perhaps the largest exporter of gas—I believe that we have now superseded Qatar in being the largest gas exporter in the world—should be paying exorbitant gas prices or that we should have an energy crisis in this country. The reality is these are Australian resources, and I believe that it is possible for those companies that are making huge profits from the gas and coal that is exported to also support the Australian people by ensuring that we have enough supplies in this country at affordable prices. Western Australia did it with their gas reservation policy, and I believe that it is possible for the rest of the country to equally ensure that we are not left without adequate supplies of gas and that we do not face a gas energy crisis. I know that Minister Bowen is working towards whatever can be done and I will support whatever steps he takes. It is a critical issue because energy prices do not only affect households but affect our competitive advantage in our manufacturing industries and affect every other industry throughout the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also said a moment ago that I will speak briefly about Julian Assange. I have spoken about Julian Assange in this place on other occasions. As the Prime Minister has said, enough is enough. Julian Assange has been detained for long enough. Given that is the case, I will continue to urge for his release and I will continue to advocate for his release. I acknowledge that the Prime Minister has quite rightly said that this is not a matter that he will use a loudspeaker to talk about, but it is a matter that I believe should come to an end and should come to an end quickly rather than being dragged out even longer. It's something that I believe that the Australian people would expect and it is certainly something that I will be continuing to call for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his address to the first session of parliament the Governor-General referred to what I would categorise as 19 different areas of public policy which the Albanese government will address in this term of government. They have been identified by Labor as the issues that we campaigned on in the 2022 election that I believe Australians want us to focus our attention on. They are issues which touch on the lives of the people that we represent. Of course every issue will have to be addressed one step at a time. It is not a matter where any government can walk in and simply, overnight, change the direction of the country. Indeed, I would expect that, even with all the best intentions in the world, there will be other issues that arise in the course of the next two or three years that might also cause some disruption to the plans we have in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor went to an election campaign with a very clear set of policies. We went to an election campaign where we articulated the matters that we would try and address in this first parliament. The Prime Minister and the ministers that we now have in this government have already in the first week or so of this parliament introduced some 18 pieces of legislation on critical areas of reform where change is needed. They are not areas of reform where we can just simply put through some minor piece of legislation that is not controversial. They are areas of reform where major change is required, including aged care, climate change, industrial relations, acknowledging the Indigenous people of this land and so on. I thank those ministers because, quite frankly, most of those issues are very long overdue. It is a big job ahead we have in the 47th Parliament, but I have every confidence that, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, all of those matters will be addressed over the coming two or three years, and the Australian people will get the policies that they voted for.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your role. How wonderful it is to have a Queenslander. I would prefer one from our side, but I'll take a Queenslander nonetheless. It is good to be back here amongst friends. I see the member for Gellibrand. With his long connections to the Toowoomba region he'll know just how lucky I've been to spend a lot of time with my constituency, getting out and about with the wonderful people of Groom. When we have a change of government it's important to take the opportunity to refresh, renew and get the sense of hope and vision for what we want to achieve over the coming three years. I have very much enjoyed that opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at one of the most common things that have come back to me as I travelled throughout my electorate. It is a fantastic opportunity. You can travel an hour west from Toowoomba on either the Warrego or the Gore and still stay within the seat of Groom. A common refrain at the moment is concern around foot-and-mouth disease. I think it's important to articulate this concern, particularly to towns like Oakey and Pittsworth. Fundamentally their entire economy is at risk. I don't seek to induce panic; I simply want to make very clear what this means to our regions and why they have such heightened concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at the Barn at Oakey speaking with several small businesses that are all part of small supply chains. They feed through to these industries. Of course, we have the feedlots. We have the second-largest feedlot in the Southern Hemisphere at Grassdale, not far past Bowenville. You can stand there and see 80,000 head of cattle. It's a fantastic sight to see. We have transport companies that are entirely built around moving the cattle. We have meatworks out there that employ people from all over Australia. It's a fantastic economy all built together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The concern that they have about that outbreak is significant. It's one that I'll continue to raise because I think it's important that they do hear their concerns raised here. The important part is that they know, as we do, that Indonesia is a very different environment to us. We rely very heavily on export dollars. That's not something that is part of the Indonesian beef market, so we do have a different approach. We do have high standards that we need for those export dollars coming in. It is so crucial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key part when you drive through our electorate is the state of our local roads. So many times that comes back to us. I think particularly of the Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road, which struggles significantly as it travels through the black soil west of our region. Obviously we've had heavy rain for such a long time. Working with the state and the council to make sure those roads are upgraded is going to be absolutely important. Regional towns that surround Groom rely upon roads not just to get to and from work but because this is how we move our product to market, how we do business and how our economies are sustained.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have grown tremendously in Groom. As that new infrastructure comes in we need to make sure it connects well with the existing road infrastructure. I was at the corner of the Toowoomba-Athol Road and the Gore Highway. I was concerned to see how people were making legal U-turns, quite frankly, in an area that is tremendously dangerous. This can be addressed by good infrastructure. These are the sorts of concerns I want to see put through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But underlying everything is a concern about housing in our area. We do have housing shortages and have had housing availability and affordability issues. I want to raise the great efforts of three organisations. One is Tony's Community Kitchen. They provide food and care for homeless people in our region. I was with them as they celebrated their 50,000th meal. That was a point of celebration for the volunteers, but not so much a celebration when you think about the need for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This evening BASE Services is conducting its Homelessness for a Night campaign, where business leaders and community leaders experience what it's like to be homeless on a cold Toowoomba night. I thank them for the work they're doing. This is now their eighth year. They raise significant funds towards BASE Services, which helps homeless people get back on their feet. They're a fantastic organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last one I want to mention is Protea Place. Protea Place provides care and support for women, primarily 55 years plus women, who find themselves homeless or at a crisis point in their lives. The work they do at Protea Place is absolutely remarkable. They do it in a way that maintains dignity and privacy but also with the strength and compassion that we hope can bring a community together. I thank them all for their tremendous efforts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  It would indeed be hard to pick the biggest mess that this government has to clean up after the wasted last decade. You could pick the aged-care crisis, the state of the budget and the fiscal crisis, billion-dollar blowouts on projects, the nearly $1 trillion debt with nothing to show for it, or the energy and climate debacle—22 energy and climate policies were announced by the former Liberal-National government and not one of them was implemented. They churned through prime ministers and energy ministers, and then, before the election, they actually changed the law, through regulation, to lie, in effect, about the gas price rises that were coming. There were the rorted grants and waste; the budget was riddled with rorts and waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of the most disgraceful debacles, often overlooked, is the utter mess of the broken visa- and citizenship-processing system at the Department of Home Affairs—that giant black hole of human misery and economic carnage that we've inherited. In fact, the most common complaint received by my office is about visa and citizenship processing delays. Eighty to 90 per cent of the people who come through my front door—in the most multicultural part of Australia, I might note—are complaining about visas. They are distraught, desperate people. Over 10 years, the Liberals virtually destroyed the visa-processing system, and it affects every visa type. Businesses, large and small, are crying out for skilled workers and technicians on just short-term visas to come in and install multimillion dollar equipment—the wasted capital in economic opportunity. There have been actual shutdowns at plants because of the visa system. The health system is desperate for the nurses, doctors and skilled health workers who are waiting for visas. Universities are desperate for the researchers and global talent waiting for visas. The international education sector was our fourth-biggest export sector, and yet universities and private providers and TAFEs are screaming about students missing the start of semester yet again, while our competitors in the US, Canada and the UK are steaming ahead, stealing our students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families and people who fall in love with someone from overseas are waiting one, two, three or, in some cases, four years for a visa for their loved one. I've lost count of the number of people who have never met their own children because of the former government's negligence. These are people from countries that don't give visitor visas, so they might have conceived the child in a third country and now they're stuck here waiting, waiting, waiting for years for a visa to meet their own child. Relatives are dying and special occasions like weddings and anniversaries are being missed because now there's a crisis in visitor visas. It's like a game of Whac-A-Mole. We try to fix one problem and then another arises. The fact is that the previous government cut thousands of staff over a decade. Desperate, vulnerable people fleeing war and persecution, most especially in my community, are faced with the choked visa system in the humanitarian stream.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate has more people born in Afghanistan than any other electorate has. I don't have time to describe to the House in detail the human misery that is my front foyer every day, as people worry about their relatives being hunted by the Taliban because the miserable Liberal-National former government did not process their visas. It is the former government's fault. We had 10 years of neglect and cuts, and more cuts were baked into the last budget, in March, which, if we do nothing, will see more staff cut next year from the department.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't fix 10 years of damage in 10 weeks, but Labor is taking responsibility and I will keep speaking up—perhaps to the pain of the relevant ministers, but I'll keep speaking up. I'm pleased that the minister confirmed the processing backlog is an urgent priority. He's directed the department to devote more staff to this. Nearly 140 new staff since May have been put on board, a surge capacity has been established, and there has been a 10 per cent increase in applications finalised in June compared to May. That's a good start, but it is a drop in the ocean of what's going to be needed to clear this dreadful backlog. There's a long way to go.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's other critical policy work in our national platform that Labor is committed to, including giving genuine refugees permanent protection in this country and moving them off the cruel TPV-SHEV visa system. People have been here for 10 years, working and paying taxes; 87 per cent of them are employed full time or are running businesses, so the department tells us. They are separated from their families and missing their children growing up. It does our country no good to have a permanently temporary underclass of people—living here, working, in the community, but never able to participate fully or become citizens of this country. The Labor government will fix this. We're working on it. It's going to take time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, it is so easy in life to destroy things. You can knock a house down, but then it takes months or years to rebuild. That's what we're facing with the visa crisis. It's going to take years to clear the backlog, to recruit staff, to skill them, to security-clear them and to train them, but we've started the job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  I want to urge the government to take foot-and-mouth disease very seriously, especially here during question time, which we haven't seen them do. At the dairy conference I was at recently and post that meeting, the concern was palpable. In fact, it was far worse than that. Every farmer knows how serious this is. Every livestock transporter, abattoir or regional small business knows how serious this is. Yes, the government does need to do more to invest in Indonesia to try to keep this disease out of Australia—to keep the virus out. Be a good neighbour and fully resource the efforts, all of the efforts, in Indonesia. That is the best way forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to see every passenger and piece of luggage screened. Everyone returning is a potential risk. Taking only a risk based approach to this is not enough, because foot-and-mouth disease is such a significant risk. It's one of the greatest challenges we face. Relying on an incoming passenger's card as to whether they've been on a farm or are bringing meat—they don't always tell the truth, and we saw that in Darwin today—is simply not enough. The government has to take this extremely seriously and insist on actually screening every passenger coming back into Australia. We don't know how many passengers have actually been screened. There have been thousands coming back to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that one positive test, as we heard in a briefing, will stop all meat exports around Australia for at least two years. Just one positive test would mean at least two years. We know that 70 per cent of Australia's livestock production is exported and 90 per cent of Western Australia's livestock production is exported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I did earlier on, I want to make this more real for anybody who's watching it. People in this place know that I am part of a dairy farming family, in Harvey in Western Australia. I want to talk about what this would mean to our dairy farming business. On the advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer, a regional veterinary officer could come and test if there was a suspicion of foot-and-mouth disease on our property. One positive is all it would take. There'd be no milk pick-up. There'd be nothing and no-one moving in or out of that property, and those beautiful cows that we've spent 50-plus years breeding to wonderful pedigree bulls, those beautiful cows that are so much a part of our lives, would be shot and burned or buried—every animal on the property and potentially other associated properties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There'd be a three-kilometre radius around our property for testing, and if any future tests proved positive that perimeter would move out further and further and affect more and more farmers and more and more of our community. There would be culls at each one of those places—every one of those animals—and there would be no animals on our farm until the regional veterinary officer said so, and that would be at least two years. Look at all the effects on local businesses in our patch, in our part of the world and right around Australia if that happens. And if it gets into the feral pig population and other feral animals, good luck in trying to control it! We are so concerned about this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, as well, I just looked simply throughout my own area, asking: who would be affected, besides the immediate dairy farms not having a business, and the farms and beef? Harvey Fresh's milk and dairy products—no movement or processing there; Harvey Beef—no exports; Harvey Water, which supplies irrigation; our local LP &amp; JA Fryer, who supply to farmers; Milne Feeds, with feed; livestock agencies; the Peters/Brownes factory down the road in Brunswick; V&amp;V Walsh abattoirs; Dardanup butchers; and livestock transporters would stop immediately, as would fuel companies and supermarkets. This will have an effect on the whole region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am urging the government: do everything you can. Throw everything you need to at this, particularly starting in Indonesia. And please encourage every passenger—we need every passenger to be screened and tested. They need good information: 'This is the risk we face. Please bear with us.' It's not okay just to take a risk based approach to identifying people; every individual is a potential risk coming back into Australia, and we need to apply the utmost rigour to the screening as we do to the mail coming in, and we need to stop any— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  This is the second time I've followed the member for Forrest on FMD. I will just reiterate, for the benefit of the House: the government is doing everything it's been asked to by the authorities to manage this issue in Indonesia. Any suggestion that we are doing otherwise is reprehensible, quite frankly. The NSW Farmers Association has specifically asked those opposite to stop scaremongering and to stop fanning the flames of fear. The risk of FMD coming into this country has gone from nine per cent to 11 per cent. The government is taking it very seriously. We have put in some of the strongest biosecurity measures ever seen in the country's history. It really is incumbent on those opposite, who often say they represent regional communities, to stop fanning the flames of fear.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, today marks the beginning of Homelessness Week 2022. This very important week brings to the fore the challenges facing many vulnerable Australians. In Tasmania, for example, we have 50 specialist homelessness services which have supported more than 6½ thousand clients over the past year. Labor knows that access to safe, affordable and sustainable housing can have a profound impact on a person, improving their social health, employment and education outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now there are around 4,400 Tasmanians on the waiting list for social and public housing. A priority applicant on this list faces a wait of, on average, 67 months for housing—that's 5½ years. It's gone up a year in the last year and a half alone. That's a devastating statistic—that somebody in desperate need of a home is told they could be waiting 5½ years. Frankly, the Tasmanian government has ignored the looming housing crisis that's been created under its watch, making very big promises but failing to deliver its promised 10,000 new affordable homes by 2032; that's what the Liberal government promised Tasmanians. That's three new builds a day every day. They really need to get their skates on!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime vulnerable Tasmanians continue to face the cold reality of housing stress and homelessness. We have people living in cars and caravans, and bunking with mates. The list is endless. Far and away the most common inquiries to my office are about housing. There is a grandmother trying to find housing for a grandchild who's sleeping in his car. There is a young dad who works at a bakery who lives apart from his wife and kids, who are bunking with a mate of hers, and he bunks with mates in another house because they just can't find a place. They earn a good income between them—he's got a full-time job, she's got a part-time job—but there's just no housing. There is a disability pensioner couch surfing and forced to delay surgery because she does not have stable accommodation for her recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office does the utmost to assist, but it should not take intervention from a member of parliament, whether state or federal, for these cases to get the attention they deserve. There should be assistance baked into the system. I note the member for Groom quite rightly lauded the actions of agencies and charities in his electorate; they do fantastic work. But the structure should be there in government. We know that the former government cut the structures over their 10 years in office. They cut and they cut and they cut, and now we have this housing crisis before us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Homelessness is a systemic issue. To end homelessness we need a plan, and that's the theme of Homelessness Week this year. The Albanese government recognises that homelessness is a significant issue, and we are committed to working with the states as well as stakeholders across both housing and social services to tackle this national issue, and I'm proud to say we've started work on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to recognise the work of my Tasmanian colleague the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness, who hosted a meeting of housing ministers last month—the first of such meetings in almost five years. There's a housing crisis in this country, and it's the first time in five years the state and federal housing ministers have got together. Unbelievable! It was the first step in designing and delivering a housing reform agenda to address the significant challenges across the housing spectrum from homelessness to housing affordability. The Albanese Labor government is serious about this issue, I know the minister is serious about this issue and we'll get on with it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I would like to speak tonight about the attack by the Albanese-Marles Labor government on regional Australia. With the changes to the distribution priority area for health, we are already seeing doctors from more remote and regional areas flocking into more highly populated areas. That is because of changes to a program that was designed to give an advantage to regional towns and to allow those regional towns to draw from a broader pool. Now we're going to see those doctors sucked into peri-urban and larger regional areas and probably end up working in larger 'churn through' medical centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of greater concern is the attack on the Building Better Regions Fund. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that grants from a regional program go to regional electorates. How strange would it be otherwise. I would have thought that that was a bit of a ludicrous thing to say until we saw what happened with the distribution priority area. Maybe we are going to see regional programs go into capital cities. This extraordinary attack on the Building Better Regions Fund and the government's response to the Audit Office report clearly indicate that the government thinks the public servants should make all the decisions about where funding goes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of a member of parliament, regardless of which one of the 151 seats you represent, is to represent that seat, and you've got to know the area. There could be two identical projects in different towns, and you know that one organisation has the ability to actually carry it off and one doesn't. That's what a local member knows. Someone in an office in Canberra doesn't understand that nuance and that difference. So, if we left these decisions up to the public servants, we would end up giving the money to the places that don't need it, because, in order to tick the boxes to get it, you would have to prove that you didn't really need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm wondering what sorts of programs the Albanese-Marles government would fund. Would they not want to fund the Tottenham pool or the multipurpose centre or the Moree Aged and Disability Services centre? There is the Trangie respite facility, so that people in a small country town have got respite—not only for that town but for the broader agricultural region that they service. There is the Baradine Golf Club. It's a very small club with a handful of members. Their clubhouse was decrepit; they couldn't use it. The $140,000, together with their volunteer labour, got them a new clubhouse. So the town of Baradine now has a clubhouse and a golf club. It's something that the bigger centres with large memberships and corporate sponsors can do. Baradine has about 500 or 600 people, and, when we are trying to encourage people to come and work in Baradine, being able to play golf is one of the things they tick. There is the YMCA in Broken Hill. Would the government help to contribute to that new centre so that the people of Broken Hill and visitors and other people looking to move there have got a health and physical fitness centre that is worthwhile? There is $9½ million for an opal centre at Lightning Ridge and $10 million to help the Bourke shire set up a small-animal abattoir that's going to employ 130 local, mainly Indigenous people. Those are real programs that actually make a difference to a community—they lift people out of disadvantage by giving them a job. They're the sorts of programs that are funded under BBRF. I've got two or three pages of them that I could go through just in my electorate. Some of them are quite small. Some of them are $30,000. But, for the Warren museum, there is $3 million to upgrade a heritage centre for Warren, a small country town.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  Dr Yang Hengjun is an Australian citizen arbitrarily detained in China. Sean Turnell is an Australian citizen arbitrarily detained by the military junta in Myanmar. Chau Van Kham is a 72-year-old Vietnamese-Australian detained for his political beliefs in Vietnam. Cheng Lei is an Australian citizen and journalist jailed in China. There are many Australians enduring very tough conditions—harsh conditions—in detention overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of us here in this place, on all sides of the chamber, have spoken out on behalf of these Australians—in the media and in this place. I speak on behalf of one tonight: Robert Pether, an Australian citizen detained in an Iraqi prison. Robert Pether is an Australian father of three, and husband to Desree Pether. Not many people have heard of Robert Pether; Robert Pether is not a household name. He is not on the nightly news or on the front page of the paper, but he has now been imprisoned in Iraq since April 2021, last year—for more than a year; 16 long, horrible months. That's why in this place it's important that we shine a spotlight on his case and continue to advocate to the Iraqi government for Robert's release and safe return home to his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In April 2021, Robert flew to Iraq to resolve a dispute between the Central Bank of Iraq and his employer, engineering firm CME Consulting. Robert and his colleague, Khalid Zaghloul, an Egyptian national, were arrested in Baghdad. Robert was sentenced to five years imprisonment on deception charges and fined US$12 million over a contractual dispute between his employer and the Central Bank of Iraq. Robert Pether maintains his innocence. He raised issues related to his access to justice and his treatment, including that he had no knowledge that he had signed a confession because it was a document given to him in Arabic. He doesn't read or write Arabic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Robert is enduring the difficult and harsh conditions of his detention, while his health has rapidly deteriorated. His case is dire. He is struggling with his physical and mental health. I have spoken to Desree, Robert's wife, and she tells me he has lost a lot of weight as well. Robert is also a cancer survivor, and Robert's doctor has noted he is also concerned that his melanomas may have returned. He urgently needs a biopsy to confirm this diagnosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strain on Robert is terrible, but so is the pain of his family—the pain they've had to endure for over 16 months—his wife, Desree, and his children, Nala, Oscar and Flynn. The Pether family have sold a property to help pay for Robert's legal fees, and, I think, a car as well. All they want is Robert to return home safely. His daughter, Nala, draws pictures of what she plans to do with dad when he gets out and is back home. Desree tells me it's hard to keep the kids' and Robert's hopes up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Albanese Labor government are doing all that we can to support Robert and his family. I know that Desree was heartened to learn that a constructive phone conversation occurred between the Prime Minister and his counterpart, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, taking place in early July. Our diplomats are working around the clock in Baghdad and in Canberra, doing everything they can to assist Robert and to pursue his case. And in this place I—and I think, hopefully, I will be joined in a bipartisan way by my colleagues—call on the Iraqi government to consider Robert's case and grant him the clemency which is available under Iraqi law and/or release Robert on compassionate grounds, given his dire health condition. This is also available under Iraqi law, particularly as he has already spent almost a year and a half in detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the Iraqi Prime Minister, Mr Kadhimi, and President Barham Salih to take these actions on compassionate grounds. And I hope—as, I think, we all hope—that we will soon see Robert Pether home safely with Desree, Nala, Oscar and Flynn.</span>
              </p>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I wish to talk about the original teal campaign—ovarian cancer and its lack of funding for research, support and treatment. Ovarian cancer has the lowest survival rate of all women's cancers, and I strongly urge the government to implement the Ovarian Cancer National Action Plan. I recently met with two Warringah constituents, Kristin and Ruth, who have both endured extensive battles with ovarian cancer. These extraordinarily resilient women kindly shared their lived experiences and insights with me, and the extreme challenges they've faced on their own cancer journeys. These highlight the need for urgent action to improve awareness, treatment, support and survival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day in Australia four women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and I was shocked to learn that half of women diagnosed will pass away within five years. Those who survive the threshold are rarely given the all clear. Instead, they have a looming threat of recurrent disease remaining alarmingly high. Around 70 per cent of women with advanced ovarian cancer will experience a disease recurrence within three years. It brings significant psychological impacts to patients and their families, and many experience a fear of recurrence over a sustained period of time. The ovarian cancer journey is riddled with uncertainty and mental health impacts, leading to low quality of life as those affected endure extreme medical challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020 Ovarian Cancer Australia undertook a collaborative process of consultation with stakeholders to come up with the Ovarian Cancer National Action Plan. The plan strongly advocates for a robust improvement in ovarian cancer research; access to personalised, precision treatment; and a national commitment to decrease its incidence and improve survival rates. Ovarian Cancer Australia recommends a large-scale investment into ovarian cancer research to improve the five-year survival rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current awareness initiatives are just not good enough. Ruth and Kristin told me that many diagnoses of ovarian cancer are incidental, with symptoms often being dismissed as general discomfort. Increased awareness of symptoms will lead to early detection. It is so important that we improve all these elements of the system, and the Ovarian Cancer National Action Plan will go some way to doing that. Kristin told me: 'I'm alive today only because of clinical trials and personalised medicine. I am proof that investments in these pay off.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so important that we acknowledge and remember the real stories of people who are impacted by ovarian cancer. These women and their families should be seen not as mere statistics but as real Australians who are calling on us to help. These are very much the real deal when it comes to teal, and we must get behind more ovarian cancer research.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  The Prime Minister gave, I thought, one of the finest speeches he's given, at the Garma Festival, where he showed some vulnerability and he showed some humility when he outlined his vision for the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the government's answer to it. I acknowledge the Minister for Indigenous Australians, the member for Barton; Senator Dodson; Senator Malarndirri McCarthy; and the many, many hundreds of other people who have contributed to getting the Uluru Statement from the Heart to where it is today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of the Uluru Statement from the Heart didn't just begin in 2017 in this incredible gathering and coming together of people. The history of a First Nations voice, and the idea of a voice to parliament, is one that predates that by many, many decades—in fact, by many, many generations. The person in Australia who first came up with the idea of a voice to parliament and really advocated for it on a national stage was William Cooper. William Cooper, in 1937, presented a petition, which he wanted to present to the royal family in England, that outlined calling for representation of First Nations people to the federal parliament. He didn't specify that it had to be someone of First Nations descent; it was someone who understood the challenges of First Nations people. William Cooper, in 1937, asked for the very first voice to Australian parliament. At that time, the federal government denied William Cooper's request to send that petition to the royal family. Sadly, before William Cooper passed away, that petition was sidelined. But William Cooper's grandkids saw the formal presentation of his petition to the royal family, to the Queen, only a few years ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was most remarkable about William Cooper's request for a voice in 1937 was that, at that time, William Cooper didn't have the right to vote in this country at all. He didn't have the full citizenry rights that should be enjoyed. What's even more remarkable is that, in 1938, the year after his petition was rejected by the Australian government, William Cooper led a march of Aboriginal people protesting against the treatment of Jewish people on the other side of the world, in what's widely believed to be the only private protest against the Nazi persecution of Jewish people anywhere in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">William Cooper and the idea of empowering people sparked something that we have unfinished business on. I say to the people of Macnamara, who I proudly represent, when this idea comes before the parliament I will be voting yes to have a referendum and to answer the Uluru Statement from the Heart. In the traditions outlined by William Cooper and so many who have come before us, it's what we need to do for our country. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I want the name Wilson Neuendorf recorded in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> so that it remains in perpetuity within this place. Wilson Neuendorf is an amazing Australian who lives in the community of Kalbar. He's the president of the Kalbar Progress Association. This year, he was the Australia Day Award Scenic Rim recipient of the Citizen of the Year Award, Senior. And, more recently, he was Rotary's Felix Grayson memorial inaugural Community Leadership Award recipient. Kalbar is a better place to live because of Wilson Neuendorf and the work he has done over many years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kalbar is a small community of 1,100 people, and the biggest footprint in the community is the showgrounds. Kalbar sits within the Scenic Rim. For those Australians that may not have heard of the Scenic Rim, it starts on the Gold Coast hinterland—beautiful rainforest—comes down into rich farmland and opens up into beautiful big scenic locations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, the Scenic Rim has earned the auspicious title of the No. 1 place in Australia to visit and is amongst the top 10 in the world, according to Lonely Planet—up there with Vancouver Island, the fjords of Iceland and the beautiful Burgundy region of France. Scenic Rim is the place to visit. It's fast establishing itself as one of the best places in the country, ousting the Margaret River, the Barossa Valley and the Hunter Valley—and, if you're from Tasmania, the Salamanca Market has nothing on the food that's in store, particularly throughout Eat Local Week functions, which last for a month. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, if you come to the Scenic Rim and go to the community of Kalbar, I hope you get the opportunity to meet Wilson Neuendorf, because he will take you down and introduce you to the owners of White Chapel, which was voted the best wedding venue in the state. Imagine—I'm trying to paint a picture—you've got the best wedding venue in the state, ousting Hamilton Island; it's the No. 1 place in Australia to visit, and, according to Lonely Planet, is in the top 10 places to visit in the world. Come and visit Kalbar. Come and visit the Scenic Rim. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wilson has grown vegetables all his life and he's a pork producer, so he's at the heart of Eat Local Week, where we showcase the beautiful produce, the beautiful food. We get some of the state's best chefs to come to the region, we celebrate food, we celebrate the region, and we celebrate our diversity. Today it gives me great pride to get to my feet and celebrate the great Australians who make this happen. Wilson Neuendorf, I commend you. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  This week is National Homelessness Week, and the theme this year is 'To end homelessness we need a plan'. I'm really proud to be part of an Albanese government that is addressing these complex challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 100,000 people do it rough every night and find themselves homeless. There are many service centres around the country that assist these people, and in Adelaide we're very fortunate to have the Hutt St Centre, which provides many services. They offer essential assistance and do things that help these people. Hutt St Centre aim to end homelessness for every person who comes in through their doors. They do this without judgement, without prejudice, because they understand better than most that homelessness is not a choice. We know it can happen to anyone due to unforeseen circumstances. Each year, the Hutt St Centre serves up to 40,000 meals, it offers social work support services to nearly 2,000 people, and it helps to put them back into accommodation. I'd like to commend the great work that the Hutt St Centre do, including their experienced team, and I thank them sincerely for their great services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why every year I am incredibly honoured to support the Hutt St Centre's Walk a Mile in My Boots challenge, which raises funds for the centre. In the past, thousands of Adelaide residents would get together and walk the challenge in a show of solidarity, together with homeless people, to raise much-needed funds, as I said. But, because of COVID, these last few years have seen a different type of challenge, where participants walk independently. That will be taking place again this year to raise money for this fantastic centre. The goal this year is to help end homelessness for the more than 6,000 people facing winter without a place to call home in my home state of South Australia. This is a serious issue in Australia, and we all need to work together as governments, communities et cetera to address it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we know there are over 100,000 people doing it tough every night, whether they're homeless or couch surfing, and people can find themselves in those circumstances through no fault of their own. There are groups like the Hutt St Centre and many other groups around the country that do great work. So I'm very pleased that this year I will be taking this challenge again, as I have in past years, to raise funds for this wonderful centre that assists people. Last year we visited with Jason Clare to look at the centre and see the great work that they've done. They are doing it tough. They need more funds. They need more government support, and I will be supporting them to get it. Homelessness is a serious issue and we all need to work to address this together.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  For more than 30 years, National Missing Persons Week has raised awareness of the issues surrounding missing persons and profiled long-term missing members of the community in hopes that answers may be found for loved ones left behind. This year's campaign, launched yesterday and running through to 6 August, is called Without Them, challenging each of us to identify with the missing, feel the weight of each missed year and consider our own emotional reaction to having a loved one go missing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to take this opportunity to bring awareness of the campaign and missing northern Tasmanians. According to Sergeant John Delpero of the Tasmania Police Missing Persons Unit, around 125 people are reported missing in Tasmania each year. While over 97 per cent are located, there are still a small number each year who are not found safe and well. There are many well-known missing persons cases in Tasmania, including those of Nancy Grunwaldt and Lucille Butterworth. But I'd like to highlight some lesser-known cases in northern Tasmania in the hope that somebody may have some information that could be useful for Tasmania Police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, 171 Tasmanians are reported missing in Tasmania, with Bruce Fairfax included in this list. Mr Fairfax was a beloved and respected teacher at the Launceston Church Grammar School, where he had taught for 29 years before he went missing while hiking with his wife, Louise, at the Duckhole Lake Track. As is the case for all loved ones left behind when someone goes missing, Bruce's disappearance has left a deep well of grief for his family, friends and colleagues, who are left to mourn his loss but without the certainty of knowing what happened and where he is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to highlight a more recent case of a missing person from George Town. Anthony Goodyer was 46 years old when he went missing on the afternoon of 4 February last year. He was last seen walking on the East Tamar Highway near George Town, wearing dark-coloured shorts, a dark T-shirt and tan work boots and carrying a shoulder bag. Mr Goodyer's is one of seven missing persons cases in the spotlight of Tasmania Police as part of the 2022 National Missing Persons Week, and I'm hopeful that someone may hold a crucial piece of information that may lead to finding Mr Goodyer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I wish to highlight the case of Robert Mansell, who was reported missing from Flinders Island on 8 August 2015, when he was 42 years old. Mr Mansell was last seen at Salmon Rocks, a popular recreational fishing spot; despite an extensive search, he has not been found. In 2020 a coroner determined that Mr Mansell had died in suspicious circumstances. Anyone with information can contact Tasmania Police on 131 444 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is home to communities of many backgrounds, especially so in south-west Sydney and the electorate of Werriwa. On 7 May I attended two separate events: a gathering of the Cambodian community and one of the Kurdish community. They're two cultures that are thousands of kilometres away from each other in the world, but right here in Sydney they're just a few suburbs apart. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cambodian people have a long history within Australia, with many having arrived during the seventies and eighties after escaping the Khmer Rouge regime. They have since called Australia home, and I know they are fierce Australians. I was honoured to be invited by the Cambodian National Rescue Party of New South Wales to attend and speak at their community event. I spoke about what an Albanese-led Labor government would deliver if we were to win government, and I'm privileged to have been re-elected as the member for Werriwa in an Albanese government. I'm committed to delivering for our area and the Cambodian community, who have supported me throughout the campaign. I'd like to thank the CNRP and its president. Mr Sam Rainsy was a guest speaker at the event, and his wife, Tioulong Saumura, graciously translated the speeches from Cambodian to English, which made the event, for me, just so much more personable and understanding. When she was introduced—you'll enjoy this, Deputy Speaker—she was introduced as Mr Rainsy's wife, and she pointed out that she wasn't his handbag; she has also been a member of parliament in her own right. It was just a really lovely afternoon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The temple and its volunteers have spent most of the last two years supporting their community, with translations for COVID measures and what was required, and providing many practical supports. I'd really like to thank the Cambodian community, especially Chhayri Marm, for the always warm welcome and the invitation.</span>

I'd like to thank the Democratic Kurdish Community Centre of New South Wales, the Federation of Democratic Kurdish Society and the Sydney Kurdish Youth Association for the invitation to the day. They even coaxed me into joining in their cultural dance, which I did very badly, but everybody was so welcoming and supportive—even though I have three left feet.</span>

But there is another special group of people who are dedicated to making our community better every day, and they are our local community volunteers.

The last time I was in this chamber speaking about my fabulous Cowan community was a while ago, actually—back in March—and a lot has happened since then. Since then, we've had an election; I've been honoured to be sworn in as the Minister for Early Childhood Education and the Minister for Youth; but, most of all, I've been honoured to be elected for a third time as the member for Cowan. It was, in fact, the very first time I was able to celebrate my win on the day of the election as the member for Cowan, because the previous two elections had been so tight. I am eternally grateful to the people of Cowan and the Cowan community for once again putting their faith in me and returning me to be their representative here in this place.</span>

In June, I was fortunate enough to attend the Lockridge Senior Citizens Association at their recently upgraded centre. Beryl and the team are doing great work for their local community.</span>

I really want to thank Val and the committee for making us so welcome. I will get you that sewing machine and those fabrics, Val, I promise.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday 25 June, Dave, my husband—once again, always accompanying me because that's our social life—and I were thrilled to attend the Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre night of celebration. It was to celebrate a milestone of 10 years, but it was also a chance to honour the founding CEO, Bec Johnson, who's moved on after a very successful time at the T1D centre. They do fantastic work, working with children with type 1 diabetes and their families, and I look forward to continuing some important work with them.</span>

That community met at the Herb Graham centre in Mirrabooka, in the heart of new Cowan, for prayers. Thank you to Muhamed and the masjid community for welcoming me and also my husband, Dave. Dave features very prominently!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker Claydon, I also congratulate you on your elevation to the position of Deputy Speaker. It's a proud position to hold, and other people have gone on from your role to become the Speaker of the House. But Deputy Speaker is just as important to the workings of this parliament as the Speaker is, because of the work that I know that you do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, I will say that as a member of parliament who has lost four election campaigns—two as a candidate and two as a member of parliament—and being there once or twice, I believe that for those people on both sides of the House in the election campaign that has just passed who lost their seats, this is the cruel reality of politics, that expectations are dashed and careers are thrown on a heap. And it's often very hard for people to pick up the pieces. As former politicians, we don't have the structures or benefits that we once had and that were part of the package that was offered as we came in as parliamentarians. Those supports are no longer there. In fact, when you lose out of this place, you are on your own. So I do feel for and identify with all those people who lost their seats at the last election. It's alright for us to come here and celebrate the place being full of those who won their seats at the last election campaign. But there are a lot of people who are feeling quite a bit of grief today because of the position they've found themselves in and that they were not expecting. So, I just send a message out to all of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the whole of my career—in business, in the community and in the parliament—one of my very special topics has been aged care. You know that, Deputy Speaker; you've heard me speak on it a thousand times. But we've never faced the crisis we face today. I don't blame the previous government, I don't blame the government before that, and I don't blame the government before that, because the last thing John Howard said to me before he lost his role was, 'Russell, don't come to me and ask for more money for aged care'—that was in 2007—because the exponential rise in the costs was dramatic. We're facing that today. I will speak on it further in the future. But we are in dramatic times; we're in unprecedented times. And governments of all persuasions are going to have to address this issue before it gets out of control. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  As I have done for many, many years now, on 11 July this year I attended the South Australian Bosnia and Herzegovina society's service, commemorating the victims of what is now known as the Srebrenica genocide of 11 July 1995—some 27 years ago. At that time, 8,372 people, including men, women and children of all ages, were brutally killed by the Bosnian-Serbian army. That occurred whilst the United Nations security forces failed to intervene and to protect them. The killings have become what is known as the worst single largest massacre to take place on European soil since World War II. Each year more victims are identified and buried at the Srebrenica Potacari Memorial Centre and Cemetery. This year a further 50 victims were identified and properly placed to rest. Clearly that gave some comfort to their family members, who at least were able to identify and find their loved ones, to whom they didn't know what happened some 27 years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the night, the president of the South Australian Bosnia and Herzegovina society, Sam Hasic, gave a very passionate speech about the continued threats and suffering of the Bosnian people in his homeland and called for additional measures to ensure that those people can get on with their lives in as safe a way as possible, firstly, without having any further threats and, secondly, with those who were responsible for the massacres at the time being brought to justice. We also heard in the services both this year and in previous years survivor eyewitness accounts of some of the atrocities that took place. These were people who were there at the time, saw the killings and, fortunately, were able to survive themselves, but in the process saw family members and friends very brutally killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was 27 years ago. For the rest of the world, I guess time moves on and the events of 27 years ago tend to fade into the distant past. However, for the people of Bosnia, and particularly those who were either there or who had family members there at the time and who lost them, the memories will never fade. For them, what happened on 11 July 1995 will be with them forever. I hope, and they hope, that such an event never occurs again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to move this motion and recognise that the 21st of this month is the International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism. It is fitting that we pause and remember those victims, especially those Australians who've perished both here and overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stood in this place in August 2014 to express the heartfelt shock, grief and sorrow that we all felt about the shooting down of flight MH17. On that flight was one of my constituents, Helena Sidelik, who lived a life of joy, generosity and strength. She embodied all that is good and right with the world—the complete opposite of those who commit atrocious acts of terrorism. At the time, I joined with well over 200 friends and family members to celebrate her life and to mourn with them the loss of a remarkable lady. Sadly, there are stories like this in many communities across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that Australians were killed in the World Trade Centre attack, the Bali bombings, MH17, the London Underground and London Bridge attacks and other attacks abroad. Sadly, we've also had a number of incidents here, including the Lindt siege and the Bourke Street attack. The truth is that the threat of terrorism and violent extremism has not diminished.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia, 144 people have been charged in 71 counterterrorism related operations around Australia since 2014, when the national terrorism threat level was raised to 'probable'. That is why the previous coalition government took decisive action to prevent, detect and deter terror attacks. The new counterterrorism strategy we developed sets out a comprehensive plan to counter violent extremism, equip our law enforcement and intelligence agencies and ensure that our laws and arrangements are fit for purpose. Importantly, we delivered record funding in the fight on terror, including an extra $1.3 billion to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and boosting the Australian Federal Police's annual budget to more than $1.7 billion. We've strengthened laws to ensure that our highest-risk terrorists remain behind bars and that terrorists serve their full sentences, even when weak state laws provide discounts, and enable us to cancel the citizenship of dual-national terrorists. We've listed terrorist organisations under our Criminal Code, making it illegal to be a member or supporter, including Hezbollah and Hamas in their entirety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute today to those brave men and women who work in our national security and law enforcement agencies, because they take up the fight against terror every single day, and we owe them an enormous debt of gratitude. It's a fact that they have thwarted many planned attacks here on home soil and have saved countless lives. Of course, the public rarely get to hear about the attacks that didn't happen. Our teams have also contributed to international intelligence to prevent terrorism abroad. We can be proud of our counterterrorism officers and the contribution that they make. Australia, as it often does, is doing more than its share in the international fight against terror. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is one of the most successful democracies in the world. We have a peaceful, cohesive society, made up of those who have come from across the sea as well as those who were born here. Ideologically based violent extremism in any form threatens our way of life and our social fabric. It will never be tolerated. It will never be accepted. And nor should it be. Terrorism has, senselessly, taken too many Australians from us. On 21 August, we will remember them, and we will acknowledge their families, who still suffer the pain of their loss. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I want to thank the member for McPherson for this motion. Almost 20 years ago, at 11 pm on 12 October 2002, three bombs exploded in Bali, one at the Sari Club and one at Paddy's Pub—both Kuta Beach clubs that were popular with foreigners—and one in front of the United States consulate. There were 202 people killed, 88 of them Australians. Scores more were wounded. This attack was the largest single loss of Australian lives due to an act of terror. As well as 88 Australian sons and daughters, there were 38 Indonesian nationals killed, 26 Brits, seven Americans, six Germans, five Swedes, four Dutch, four French, three Danes, three Kiwis, three Swiss, two Brazilians, two Canadians, two Japanese, two South Africans, two South Koreans, an Ecuadorian, a Greek, an Italian, a Pole, a Portuguese and a Taiwanese—human beings all taken from this earth. It was also the largest aeromedical evacuation in Australian history, with at least 66 badly injured people evacuated to Darwin for urgent medical treatment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to note that this tragedy also sparked the creation of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre, which is in my electorate of Solomon. The centre has done exceptional work ever since then to respond to disasters and emergencies all over the world. It also continues to train medical professionals around the Indo-Pacific in emergency response. And this is very important soft-power work that they do, in helping our neighbours. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While 21 August may be the International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism, their families grapple with their loss every day of the year. And, as we near the 20th anniversary of the Bali bombings in October, the land at the Sari Club still stands vacant. The Australian Bali Peace Park Association tried for two decades to establish a peace park on the site, but it has since folded. The idea was to provide a space for peaceful reflection and healing after such a terrible act of violence and to be able to secure the ongoing dignity and solemnity of the site. Australia is well placed to mark the anniversary in a number of ways. And there have been a number of ideas floated over the years. I think we should reflect and acknowledge this tragedy 20 years on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw the attention of this chamber, and of all members, to the excellent work done in this space by my colleague the member for Cowan. She examined the role of the Australian Bali Peace Park Association in a study of 'terrorist attack sites as theatres of performance that carry symbolic meaning both as the targets of destruction and as spaces for the constant reinterpretation of individual and collective perceptions of terrorism'. The member for Cowan noted in her research that terrorist attack sites are often recognised for their symbolic significance, and that gives the attack and the attackers more power that can be abused and manipulated. So it's our job, as those who remain, to commemorate the victims of terrorism so as to ensure that their deaths are not further weaponised in any way. Creating a park or a sports park is one way of neutralising that and building something positive that can unite Indonesia and Australia and be a clear and direct rejection of terrorism and the division that terrorists seek to sow.</span>

I thank the member for bringing this motion to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  I thank the member for Solomon for his words and his support for victims. I, obviously, very much thank the member for McPherson for bringing the motion to acknowledge International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism. I thank her for her previous role as Minister for Home Affairs for putting in place key legislation to make Australians safer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations General Assembly established 21 August as International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism to pay honour to and support victims and survivors of terrorism and to promote and protect full enjoyment of our human rights and freedoms. My background, in actual fact, was in counterterrorism with Victoria Police many years ago. You'll find that what terrorists do is try to cause as much harm in public as possible. They do not care. They target law enforcement. They target those in military or armed services, who are there to protect us. But in particular, they harm and they target women and children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We go back to 12 October 2002, when we had the three bombs which were discharged in Bali at the Sari Club, Paddy's Bar and the American consulate. At Paddy's Bar, young people were having fun, enjoying their time. That's what the terrorist does—targets them to cause fear so that locals, Australians and other tourists do not go to these night spots when they go to Bali. In total, 202 people were tragically killed, including 91 Australians. The attacks were, sadly, the single largest loss of Australian life at the hands of a terrorist organisation. From memory, I think it was Abu Bakar Bashir—a so-called spiritual leader but, in actual fact, a terrorist—who was behind this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another tragic terrorist attack—and I say all terrorist attacks are tragic—was on 3 June 2017. Two Australians, 21-year-old Sara Zelenak and 20-year-old Kirsty Boden, were stabbed to death during the London Bridge terrorist attack, sadly murdered along with six others. Both Sara and Kirsty risked their lives to assist others when entering the scene of this awful terrorist attack. Then we had the September 2004 attack, in which nine Australians were killed and another 160 injured in a suicide car bombing outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta. This was obviously an attack against Australians but not here in Australia. I've actually seen the footage of the victims. It's awful. The terrorists do not care about people or humanity at all. The person driving the truck full of explosives didn't even know how to drive. He drove past twice before he actually smashed into the gates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so important to make sure we do everything that we can in government to protect Australian citizens. The former Minister for Defence, Minister Dutton, who was at that time Minister for Home Affairs, made the right call by cancelling the citizenship of Abdul Benbrika, also known as Abu Bakr. Abdul Benbrika was a person serving 15 years in prison, and I'm assuming he would get life now for his planned terrorist attacks. He was the mastermind planning the attacks at Crown Casino, the MCG and, I believe, Federation Square. He also spoke about assassinating the former Prime Minister. We put in place laws that mean he cannot be released, because he has not changed. I also congratulate the member for McPherson, who, in her previous role as Minister for Home Affairs, again ensured that Abdul Benbrika would not be released. I believe he'd attended the Preston mosque, and he was kicked out of the mosque. They knew he was an extremist and dangerous, and yet he recruited people—youngsters—to follow him in his cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're very lucky. I thank all our law enforcement agencies, including the Australian Border Force, the Australian Federal Police and state and territory police, for the work that they do. Finally, when it comes to the families of the victims, obviously every day is a day they remember—in particular, birthdays and anniversaries. Every Christmas is a day that brings back the awful pain in their hearts.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I rise also to make a few comments in relation to the motion that is before us. Terrorism is awful. The poor victims of terrorism and their families, particularly the families, live with it for the rest of their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, terrorism has always been with us. It's something that, in Western society, we might forget about. We might be lulled into a sense of security for a number of years, and then there's an horrific attack, such as what happened in New York a few decades ago, that makes us realise that terrorism could strike at any time and could strike at any one of us. Usually it comes from a place of hate and is designed to cause significant pain and to make a point. Most of us can recall where we were at the time the Twin Towers came down. I was quite young; I was at university. When I first turned on the television, I thought I was watching a movie, only to be shocked to realise that it was actually happening in real time, in real life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From that moment there's been a significant shift, particularly in Western democracies, around how we need to act and be more vigilant in relation to terrorism. There's been a lot of conversation about what we need to do to ensure that we're not just supporting victims but preventing future attacks. That's where we need to be more engaged and more supportive of groups, and of our society and our governments, who attempt to deradicalise, to build bridges and to engage those who might feel isolated so they don't become more radicalised in our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note that, of the opposition speakers, none spoke about the horrific terrorism incident that occurred in our neighbouring country New Zealand, where 51 people were killed while worshipping, by an Australian terrorist who went to New Zealand to cause harm. Just as we remember all of the victims and reach out the hand of friendship, we also need to remember that we have a role to play in educating and engaging our own citizens. We have some responsibility in that. He was an awful, awful person who did a horrific thing. He was an Australian, and we all felt a strong sense of shame and disappointment that day that one of our countrymen could do that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right-wing terrorism is on the rise, and it is something that our law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent. I know that in my own electorate we had our own scares, which were not talked about a lot because of the great work of our law enforcement agencies. When our council approved the building of a mosque, it became a bit of a stand-off between the far left and the far right, who came to Bendigo to voice their opposition or their support. A few people who attended those rallies in Bendigo were arrested, and it was later discovered that one of those in attendance—a far-right extremist—had bomb-making material on his home computer and had parts of what he could use to make a pipe bomb. It was only because of the amazing efforts of our law enforcement agencies that no real damage was done, and I, as well as many in our community, pay tribute to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming out of those rallies, there were the first ever convictions in Victoria of far-right extremists for racial vilification. Why does this matter? Because it is about saying to people that you cannot racially vilify; that people have the right to live in this country, to practice their religion and to have freedom of speech; and that we will call it out. Not all right-wing speech and hate leads to terrorism, but it does help inflame and give the okay. If there were not that rally that had been organised, maybe this individual with that equipment would not have been in Bendigo on that day. This is why we have to make sure that we are addressing all aspects of what causes individuals to become radicalised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These days like the International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism are important, not just to say to the families that we feel for them but to recommit, as a society, to being more inclusive, to being strong and vigilant, and to making sure that no-one else ever suffers these terrible tragedies again. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I thank all those who have contributed in a bipartisan way on this motion, particularly the member for McPherson for moving it and giving us the opportunity to discuss this very important issue, which is remembering that the world we live in is a dangerous one and that there are a lot of people in this country and around the world who keep us safe and do so much to protect us from the risk of terrorism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure everyone in the debate, not just those whom I've listened to since entering the chamber, has talked about some of their own recollections of epochal moments related to terrorist attacks. Obviously, everyone of a certain age has their own recollection of where they were when the September 11 terrorist attacks happened, with the attacks on the World Trade Center and other aircraft hijackings in the United States, in 2001. I was in school at the time, and it was the evening here in Australia. Just about to go to bed, I happened to see the very beginnings of the coverage of that attack, which was when the first building had been struck but before the second building was struck. For me, as someone who was only 18 years old, it was the first time I could comprehend something of that magnitude happening. Obviously, it changed the United States dramatically. It changed our country and the whole world dramatically in many ways. I pay tribute to Australians—including members of this parliament such as the member for Herbert, who is with us—who proceeded to serve our nation in Afghanistan and other theatres of conflict in response to the unprovoked attacks and the need to ensure that the people responsible for that were brought to justice and that the risk that they posed was removed. While there were the innocent victims who unfortunately succumbed on that day, there could have been more into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must always remember that, although we reflect on and think through the attacks that occur, there are so many that could have occurred if our national security agencies didn't do the work that they do. Of course, we'll never know some of the threats that they have removed from the free people of Australia and around the world. But I'm very confident that, if it weren't for the work that they do and the service and protection that they provide, other attacks would have occurred and could occur into the future. This motion gives us an opportunity to really acknowledge that. At times, of course, it's very important that these things be confidential. They are related to the national security of our nation, and so the people who probably give the greatest service to us are not always fully acknowledged publicly, because that's simply not possible. But this gives us the opportunity to make that point through this debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in London in June 2017 when the London Bridge attacks occurred. I remember that was around 10 o'clock in the evening. I was in my hotel room. I couldn't believe that within walking distance of where I was staying, if I'd decided to go out instead of going back to my hotel room after dinner, I could have been in the midst of a terrorist attack—perhaps a victim of it. Tragically, two Australians were killed in that attack. Of course, the phone lights up and everyone who is back home in Australia who has heard that this has happened is trying to get in contact with you, because they know you're in London and they're desperately concerned that you could have been a victim of this attack. That makes it very real at a personal level, to have been in proximity to the sort of attack that occurred then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These risks are ever present, and, unfortunately, they will be into the future. We have to accept that. We have had to change the way we live our lives over the last few decades because of the growing risk, particularly through new technology et cetera, of people who want to terrorise free people in nations across the world, just as much here in Australia as anywhere else. We have to remember that there are necessities and there is a balance between the free way we want to live our lives and the important need to give our security services and agencies the powers and the tools they need to protect us, particularly from the great evil of terrorism. I take the opportunity to thank all of the Australian national security agencies that keep us safe and, of course, commemorate victims of terrorism both here in Australia and across the world.</span>

That day was established to be 21 August by the UN General Assembly in 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about victims of terrorism because as a professor, before I entered parliament, one of my research projects worked very closely with victims of terrorism. I've been honoured to have met many victims of terrorism over the years through my work. What many of them said to me was that there was no voice and no place for victims of terrorism in the construction of counterterrorism policies or in counterterrorism responses. So a lot of my work was looking at ways in which we can bring the voices of victims into how we respond to terrorism. Obviously, I got distracted by a political career, but I'm very proud to say that my work was continued by my PhD student, Carmen Jacques, who last year completed her PhD very successfully on victims of terrorism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to talk a little bit about some of those groups that I met, because I worked very closely with a number of victims, associations and groups over the years in looking at how victims' voices can be brought into counterterrorism legislation and policy. I first want to mention the Omagh Victims Support Group, which was set up in response to the Omagh bombing in 1998, which killed 29 and injured around 200 people. The head of that is an amazing man named Michael Gallagher, who lost his 20-year-old son Aiden in the bombing. Aiden's last words to his father were, 'I will not be long, Dad.' That was the last time that Michael saw Aiden. I urge everyone unfamiliar with the story of the Omagh Victims Support Group to watch a movie simply titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Omagh</span>, which very accurately documents the struggle of the survivors and the families of victims of the Omagh bombing to get justice for that act of terrorism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the other people I've met, apart from Michael and the Omagh Victims Support Group, I've also had the pleasure of working with victims of the Bali bombings. Much of my research was on victims of the Bali bombings. Victims of terrorism respond in different ways to their trauma. Some of them become advocates for peace as part of their healing; not all of them, but some do. Indeed, the Bali Peace Park association was comprised of victims and survivors who, together, wanted to come together and establish a peace park on the site of the Sari Club. As we all know, the Bali bombings killed 202 people, 89 of them Australians. Every year on the site of the Sari Club—up until COVID hit—89 candles are lit for each of those Australian victims. I have had the honour, along with my husband, David, of being there with the victims and survivors of the Bali bombings, lighting those candles for the 89 Australians who died. There are a group of survivors of the Bali bombings and victims of the Bali bombings for whom that Sari Club site is sacred land. That is where their loved ones died, that is where they lost their loved ones and that is where their loved ones spent their final hours. I don't think we can underestimate the significance of terrorism sites for those who have survived and the ways in which they provide healing for those victims.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pay tribute to Gill Hicks, who lost both her legs in the 2005 London bombings. Gill has become a tremendous advocate for peace and reconciliation and for building bridges and coming together. I also want to mention Alpha Cheng, the son of Curtis Cheng, who was killed in a terrorist attack, and whom I also worked very closely with in undertaking that work of building bridges, understanding and tackling the social issues that lead a young person down the path of radicalisation to violent extremism. On this day of remembering and paying tribute to the victims of terrorism, I think it's also important to remember that their voices are important, that their voices deserve to be heard and that we need to listen to how they want to heal. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  There is nothing more important than life. Any loss of life is sad, but a life cut short as a result of terrorism is a tragedy. The hate and horror that is experienced through violent extremists is a blight on the global society and has absolutely no place in humanity. We in this place must do everything we can to stop any and all acts of terror on our shores and abroad. That's why I want to speak in support of this motion recognising the up-and-coming International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism. I'd like to take this opportunity to remember those we've lost to terrorist attacks—men, women, fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mates—every single one of them with more of their life to live and more of themselves to give. Many of them left behind family members who will never be the same and will spend the rest of their own lives mourning the loss of their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we must never take for granted our democracy and the freedoms we have. We must always protect our rights to freedom of speech and expression through the democratic process. The senseless taking of life based on some sort of political motivation is never okay. In that vein, I want to reflect on the contribution of our law enforcement, our national security agencies and the Australian Defence Force. The men and women of these organisations who risk their own lives to preserve the safety of others deserve our full respect and our gratitude. There is so much that goes on behind the scenes that the average person has no idea about, but it's protecting our nation each and every day from the threat of terrorism. For that, I want to say thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I found myself in our nation's fight against terrorism in Afghanistan in 2009 with the Australian Army. We fought the Taliban there so we didn't have to fight them here. We cleared IEDs to preserve life and allow civilians to live their lives and get ahead. We built schools for girls and wells for communities. We did as much as we could to keep the terrorists at bay. I've detailed a number of times in this place the toll that took. I lost mates in country who died wearing the Australian uniform. I've lost mates at home who have succumbed to their war within. I've got friends who have lost limbs, and I suffered permanent injuries from an IED explosion. And almost a year ago, when the Taliban took back Kabul, our nation's bravest returned to the belly of the beast to evacuate thousands of civilian men, women and children. They may have lost their city and country, but our ADF heeded the call to ensure that they didn't lose their lives. These are brave, selfless actions that we must all honour here today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on the record that the Taliban are a terrorist organisation; they are no government. Just this year, on the first day of school in Afghanistan, eager female students were arriving for class to learn, to get an education—a fundamental right for children around the world. These Afghan girls were met with closed gates and armed Taliban guards. Girls in Afghanistan are not allowed to get an education—not allowed to learn. We must condemn these disgusting acts from this terrorist group. We must reaffirm that this terrorist group is no friend to democracy, no friend of Australia and no friend to the young girls of Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So many Australians have given up their entire lives to ensure the safety of others. As we remember the victims of terrorism, we must also remember those who became victims because they were fighting it head-on. Sadly, the fight will go on. And that's why we must continue to invest in the services and agencies that protect us and keep us safe. Because of our focus on keeping Australians safe, 144 people have been charged in 71 counterterrorism related operations around Australia since 2014. In a time when the national terrorism threat level was raised to 'probable', that is literally dozens of terrorist attacks that never happened because of the hard work and the intelligence gathering of our agencies. To ASIO, the AFP, the Australian Defence Force—to the many agencies that keep us safe—I want to say thank you. Thank you for your hard work in ensuring that we can live the lives we live today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all those who have lost a loved one to terrorism, I offer my sincere condolences. And to those who fight every day against the threat of terror, thank you—you have our utmost respect and support. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  Firstly I thank the member for McPherson for bringing this motion before the House. Right around the world, there would be a lot of public sympathy for victims of terrorism over the last four or five decades. Indeed, it has become almost part and parcel of the world we live in today that, all too often, innocent people—men, women and children—are mercilessly killed by people that don't even know them, people that they have never seen and people to whom they have never done anything wrong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to use this occasion to talk about two of those victims. One was Angela Golotta, a 19-year-old Australian whom I knew personally and whose family I know personally, who was killed in the Bali bombings on 12 October 2002 in the Sari Club. Angela was there with her mother, her father and her brother, holidaying in Bali at the time of the bombing. Her parents and her brother had just left the Sari Club to go back to their hotel when, a few minutes later, they heard the bombing—Angela had remained back at the Sari Club for a few more minutes—and raced back to the club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can recall listening to the story of her father, John Golotta, who was talking about the horrific carnage that he had walked into. I believe he was, in fact, the first person to set foot into the Sari Club after the bombing—seeing the bodies on the floor, some still alive, many dead, with him calling out for his daughter. It is something that I'm sure he will never, ever forget, not only because his daughter was there but also because of the carnage he saw. I know that every year, on the anniversary date, it's a very sad occasion for his family, particularly when other community and family events arise and she is no longer with them—a young 19-year-old who had the future ahead of her and was tragically taken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second person whom I also knew very well was Andrew Knox. Andrew was killed in the Twin Towers disaster in the US on 11 September 2001. I can recall Andrew, before he went to America to take up his new posting, meeting with me only weeks before he left Australia. He then went to take up that new posting. On the day of the Twin Towers disaster—or only the next morning, I think—I can recall getting a telephone call from a very close friend of his, telling me that Andrew was one of the people in the building and about Andrew's last conversation with this person, who was relaying the information to me. Indeed, I believe Andrew was on the phone, trying to make contact with his own family, at the time. I attended Andrew's funeral, which was very well supported in Adelaide. Again, I look back at both Andrew and Angela and I see two young people—Andrew was 29—who genuinely had a tremendous future ahead of them and whose lives came to an end in those two disasters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think of both of them, I also think of the literally thousands of people who have, over the years, lost their lives. Many of them I don't know, and most of us in this room would not know them, but to their families the same applies. Sadly, it seems to me that, because terrorist activities seem to happen all too often, it's now almost become simply another statistic. The reality is that for those people it is not a statistic; it's a real human life that has been lost. I say that in the context that we, as people of this world and with our fellow people around the world, need to do whatever we can to try and prevent more atrocities from happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost on a weekly basis, we hear of shootings in the USA, even in places like kindergartens and schools where innocent children are going about their daily lives. Parents send them to a place where they think that they will be safe and that they will see them at the end of the day. When I think about that and think of my own children and now my grandchildren and think it could have been one of our children that didn't come home, I can understand the feelings and the emotions they must go through. It is not just for those people who have lost their lives that lives change; for their families, lives change forever as well. So I say to the members of this House that we must collectively do whatever we can to prevent those kinds of atrocities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the first responders—not just our law enforcement agencies for the tremendous work they do but also those people who, when something like this happens, when there is an horrific act of terrorism, are the first ones on the scene to see what happens and pick up the pieces. So I give them all my thanks.</span>

The member for Boothby has spent decades on the front lines in not-for-profits looking after the needs of her community, and I know she will continue to do that and will make a huge contribution in this role and in this place, while always holding the experiences that she had on the front lines to guide her policy contributions on issues such as this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is astonishing that in Australia we still have thousands and thousands of Australians living without a secure and safe source of housing. In this National Homelessness Week, the theme is 'To end homelessness we need a plan', and a plan is exactly what this government has got. It is a plan that will continue to be built and developed and worked on during our time in government. It is significant that, for the first time in almost a decade, the federal government is willing to invest in social and affordable housing.

He is someone who tried to fob off affordable and social housing to the states, something that we're not going to be doing. We're going to make sure that we're investing directly in affordable and social housing.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, on National Homelessness Week, we, the federal government, are going to start investing back into social and affordable housing. Curtin and Chifley, following World War II, invested in social housing. Whitlam invested in social housing. Hawke and Keating invested in social housing. In the global financial crisis, a great stimulus that the Rudd government made under the housing minister, Tanya Plibersek, was in social housing. It is a great Labor legacy that, when we are in government, we invest in providing essential housing for Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that housing is a spectrum, that right across the housing industry people who are locked out of one part of the housing spectrum end up in another part. That means that people who can't afford to buy a home end up in the rental market, which drives up prices in the rental market. Less than one per cent of our rental market is available to those who are on benefits or on welfare payments such as the JobSeeker payment. That market is being crunched more and more as higher interest rates drive up the cost of borrowing, so fewer and fewer people can get into the housing market. We are seeing a slight recalibration of housing prices but, ultimately, we are not seeing on the other end of the spectrum more and more properties being made available to those who are receiving benefits.</span>

In this National Homelessness Week I am really pleased to be part of a government that is going to put $10 billion into a housing future fund that will build 30,000 social and affordable homes.

We are putting $10 billion into social and affordable housing, which will build 30,000 social and affordable homes in the first five years. This is the first time in over a decade that a federal government has put a significant amount of money on the table to invest in the construction of social and affordable housing. A portion of it will go towards women who are fleeing family violence. There will also be $200 million for the repair and maintenance for those currently in remote Indigenous communities, as well as a $30 million fund that will fund specialist services for veterans, which is something all members of the House support.</span>

We are going to help make sure there are homes for Australians in this National Homelessness Week. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I like the member for Macnamara, but that was five minutes of absolute waffle, five minutes that means nothing. The former government did the most important and significant piece of work for social and affordable housing that any federal government has done by establishing the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. I must say, the Labor Party seem to have wholeheartedly adopted it because of the important work it has done in delivering more than 20,000 social and affordable homes since its inception in 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, when the pandemic hit we put in place a whole suite of measures. One area where the member for Macnamara was not horribly incorrect was that housing is a spectrum. What we did very proudly and unashamedly was support first home buyers. We supported more than 300,000 into their first home, whether it was through the HomeBuilder grants, which those opposite opposed, or through our home guarantee scheme, under which more than 60,000 people have been able to buy a home with a deposit of as little as five per cent or, for single parents, with as little as two per cent to get into their first home. In addition, we put in place the first home super saver scheme, another policy to help first home buyers turbocharge their savings and get into their first home. Yes, the housing market is a spectrum, and if you can assist people to get into their own homes you take pressure off the entire housing spectrum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In National Homelessness Week, what have we heard from Labor? Labor have spoken a lot about it. It seems to be that the member for Macnamara has said that the Albanese government will assume responsibility for homelessness. He said that the federal government, under the coalition, saw it as the states' responsibility and that the Albanese government does not. So I assume that they now take responsibility for these things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's look at the measures that they took to the election—a very threadbare agenda, I must say. The first is the Housing Future Fund. Unlike the future funds put in place by the coalition under the great Peter Costello, which were established out of government savings, here the Labor Party are going to borrow $10 billion—borrow it—and put it into the fund. Based on assessments that I've seen, in order to deliver on their 30,000 homes over five years, that would require a return on that investment of more than 24 per cent annually, or around the 20 per cent mark annually. I don't know whether members opposite have looked at equities or those sorts of products that the Housing Future Fund would be investing in. Do they seriously believe that that $10 billion is going to generate a 20 per cent return each and every year in order to deliver their 30,000 homes over five years? The member for Macnamara said, 'We're going to build 30,000 homes.' He didn't give the sort of minor detail that that's over five years. That's less per year than we delivered in social and affordable housing when we were in government through the National Finance and Investment Corporation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the Labor Party has gone to the election saying, 'We're going to build fewer homes per year to support social and affordable housing than the coalition government, but we've got this great plan to do it, and we're gonna take responsibility from the states to do it.' What utter tosh from the government! The government is now saying they are taking responsibility, but that means they own every problem, that means they have to work with, in many cases, their state colleagues, who have presided over housing disasters. I mean, the member for Macnamara is a member of the Victorian Labor Party, which has been in office for a very long time, and we see the housing queues in Victoria longer than ever—from this very progressive, bleeding-heart Labor Party in Victoria: the longest queues we've ever seen. What has Labor been doing?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No one believes that this federal Labor government is going to do anything other than spout motherhood statements—the five minutes of guff we got from the member for Macnamara: it was just all motherhood statements, 'We've got a plan and we're going to do this and we're going to do that.' They opposed every single measure  we put in place to support people to get into their homes. We are unashamedly a party that supports homeownership but also supports those who, through no fault of their own, need a secure roof over their head. That's what we delivered through the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. I'm pleased the Labor Party is adopting that model, but let's not kid ourselves. The Labor Party has nothing other than motherhood statements.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  This motion asks this House to note that this is National Homelessness Week, and it has a theme: to end homelessness, we need a plan. As the member for Macnamara mentioned, I've spent many years in the homelessness sector, helping people in this situation. In my first speech in this place just last week I spoke at length about the terrifying ease with which people with seemingly stable and comfortable lives can fall into homelessness. It truly can happen to anyone. I've seen it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the 2016 census there were over 116,000 Australians experiencing homelessness that year. Over 19½ thousand of these were children under the age of 14, either unaccompanied or homeless with their families. Children who experience homelessness are more likely to experience it again as adults. The damaging and unsettling experience of being homeless while your brain is still developing has lifelong consequences. Of those experiencing homelessness, 43 per cent are women, and older women are the fastest-growing demographic experiencing homelessness. Women experiencing homelessness are often less visible, less likely to sleep on the streets and more likely to be couch surfing, staying in dangerous relationships or making dangerous decisions just to be off the streets. And 8,200 of these 116,000 Australians experiencing homelessness were rough-sleeping. Once you're sleeping rough, your physical and mental health declines rapidly. Constant hypervigilance, fear for your safety, lack of sleep and getting inadequate food take their toll very quickly. The average life expectancy of an Australian sleeping rough is 50 years. We don't yet have the stats from the 2021 census, but I can tell you, from the sector, we expect them to have risen significantly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was honoured to be the co-chair for the first four years of the Adelaide Zero Project, which, under the guidance of Baroness Louise Casey and Nonie Brennan from the Institute of Global Homelessness, brought together services to work in coordination to address the needs of people experiencing homelessness in the Adelaide CBD, to end their homelessness once and for all. These services included not only the homelessness services but also health, police and local government services, as well as, of course, housing. Coordination of services at the local level is important, but, ultimately, unless there are housing outcomes for people, we just have well-coordinated people on the streets. Nothing changes. And affordable housing is not affordable for these people. It is not affordable for people in homelessness who've lost everything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has inherited a severe shortage of rental properties and an increase in rental prices, and this is only going to exacerbate the number of people experiencing homelessness. Our newspapers are full of people experiencing homelessness for the first time—families separated because they can't all couch-surf at the same house; couples, both working, living in cars because their rent suddenly rose by 50 per cent; and caravan parks reporting that their accommodation is full of people living there long-term. But we shouldn't have to find sympathy via a newspaper in order to get a housing outcome. Doorknocking in Boothby, I came across people living in garages and squatting in derelict houses. People at community meetings told me about families living in cars, on the beachfront and in car parks. They told me about giving blankets and food to the man living behind the shopping centre in a wealthy area of the electorate. A man I met at a charity event pointed to his car and said, 'That's where I live now.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To end homelessness, we need a plan. Given the theme of this year's National Homelessness Week, I am proud to be a member of the Labor government, which has a plan to address homelessness. Through our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, we will build 30,000 social and affordable houses in the first five years; provide $200 million for the repair, maintenance and improvement of housing in remote Indigenous communities; and provide $100 million for crisis transition housing options for women and children fleeing domestic and family violence and older women on lower incomes who are at risk of homelessness. I look forward to working with my colleague the Minister for Homelessness, the Hon. Julie Collins MP, as this government delivers on that plan to help people experiencing homelessness.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247742" type="MemberSpeech">

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">r HOWARTH</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  I'm very pleased to be able to speak at the start of Homelessness Week on this theme, 'To end homelessness we need a plan.' We certainly do need a plan, but the state governments also need a plan. I know, in my own electorate, that homelessness is a real issue throughout Moreton Bay at the moment. People have contacted my office, particularly down at Woody Point, where people are rough-sleeping on the beach in tents and just setting up all over the place. The state government doesn't have the will to police it, because they don't have a plan to solve the problem. That's the reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just through Moreton Bay; it's in parts of Aspley and other areas as well. If you talk to those organisations that support homelessness services, like the Breakfast Club, SANDBAG, the Paddy's Van or Encircle, they'll tell you it's a big issue. But in Queensland alone there are 50,000 people on the public housing waiting list. That's 50,000, and it's getting worse. The state government—the Labor state government; the Palaszczuk government—do not know how to address it at all. There are big issues of them not managing their public housing stock. Their maintenance costs are out of control. The contractors that they put forward to homelessness organisations are charging hundreds and, sometimes, thousands of dollars and above for maintenance. These are state government contractors that are being put forward. The Palaszczuk government are not managing their public housing stock well. They're not recycling their assets. They're not getting rid of some of the old assets and putting in new housing, which is lower-cost. And they certainly are not managing the tenants well, when you've got couples in three-bedroom homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving back to this motion, the Labor government want to build 30,000 social and affordable houses in their first five years. Well, I commend them for that. They should know, though, that the Morrison government built 20,000 houses through NHFIC, through the community housing sector—which in Queensland, by the way, the Palaszczuk government barely supports; it's all public housing and private sector housing up there. We built 20,000. Even if the government builds those 30,000 houses, they all get handed back to the state governments, and the state governments have maintenance issues. They're not managing the stock and they're not recycling the stock. So I hope that the 30,000 that they do build are very low maintenance and that they think that through, because the states can't manage it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Macnamara said he wants to make public housing a federal responsibility. If the Albanese government want to be responsible for public housing maintenance, good luck to them. We already spend $1.6 billion a year through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, $320 million of which goes to Queensland. In your state, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, we cancelled the debt. We put more money into social housing down there, through the state government, than in any other state. But there are still issues in your state as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is that the government wants to put $200 million into the repair, maintenance and improvement of housing in remote Indigenous communities. Do you know what happened the last time we gave Western Australia money for that? They spent the lot of it on roads. I know that because, when I was assistant minister for homelessness, I spoke to the Labor minister over there. So I'd encourage the new minister and the government to talk to the Hon. John Carey in Western Australia, their new minister, and say, 'When we dish out $200 million, can you make sure that this time it's not spent on roads and it actually gets spent on housing?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to homelessness, the biggest group is persons living in severely crowded dwellings: 51,088 in the 2016 census. That's the growing group. The second-biggest group, for the benefit of those opposite, is persons in supported accommodation for the homeless. The crazy thing around this is that, when we spend new money getting women and children out of domestic violence situations and into brand-new homes, every single one of them is counted as homeless in the census, all because the government doesn't give some sort of period like a three-month contract.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say that building more houses is important. I would also say that we're currently spending $5.5 billion a year on Commonwealth rent assistance. What are the Albanese government going to do there—put it up or down? What are they going to do with the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement? What are they going to do with NHFIC? Are they going to continue to support it? A lot of the Labor states don't support community housing providers. In New South Wales they do, and we got 20,000 built. There are a whole lot of issues that need answering. We've got 220,000 apprentices in training. We've got the first home deposit scheme. We put forward super for housing, to get more stock. Those opposite opposed. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  Young Frankston man Jack Knight was 18 when a family breakdown left him homeless. As he told ABC News during the election campaign, he spent a couple of nights on a friend's couch before he ended up sleeping in a garage. It was very cold, he said, and he was wandering around Frankston because he didn't know what to do next. He came across a youth hangout, and someone offered him a sausage in bread. He said to them, 'I just have nowhere to go.' A support worker helped him into transitional housing and then into a share house. Jack is now a terrific social worker in Frankston. He started studying youth work and, as a case manager, helps other young people facing homelessness. He's a story of success. But, unfortunately, that success is unattainable for too many young people in my area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Youth2 Alliance, which is a group of local organisations that help young people in trouble, over the last two years 390 people aged between 15 and 25 in the Frankston-Mornington Peninsula region needed emergency housing. But there was nowhere to send them. We know that, in addition to a lack of emergency and transitional housing in my area, particularly for young people, the increase in rents has become a significant crisis. Frankston house rents rose 12.5 per cent, to a median $450 per week, over the past year, and in Frankston North, one of the most disadvantaged areas in my community, rents rose 10.1 per cent. Young people like Jack when he was in that situation can't get into those private rentals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign, the Youth2 Alliance asked all of the candidates for Dunkley to sign a pledge—and I did so—because in the Frankston and Mornington Peninsula regions there was an increase of 50 per cent in the rate of young people aged 15 to 25 requesting assistance with securing crisis housing over the COVID time. Frankston and Mornington Peninsula are two of the six worst local government areas in Victoria with regard to homeless residents sleeping rough every night. There are no local crisis accommodation options for young people, so they're forced to travel up to 2½ hours on a one-way journey on public transport to somewhere like Highett or Dandenong, or sometimes even further, to find somewhere to sleep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign, Andrew Bruun, YSAS CEO and Chair of the Youth2 Alliance, asked us to pledge to play a role in addressing the social parity issue faced by young people and families living in my community without secure housing. We were asked to commit to advocating for youth-specific crisis accommodation in Frankston and the Mornington Peninsula region and to commit to working actively with local community service organisations, lived-experience advocates like Jack and local and state governments to end youth homelessness in Frankston and the Mornington Peninsula. In this, National Homelessness Week, it seems an appropriate time for me to repeat that pledge in Australia's parliament. It is something that I am committed to and, with this Albanese Labor government, I am confident that we will make great strides towards solving. I don't know how many speeches I gave in this parliament over the last term calling on the previous government to support these calls for youth crisis accommodation in my area. They weren't answered. But I will not give up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't be there on Wednesday, but the Salvation Army is holding an 'end youth homelessness' rally, asking people to come and make a plan—that's the theme of homelessness week: make a plan—share ideas and grab a sausage at the White Street Mall on Wednesday. I wish them all the best of luck and hope that people in my community go, because this is something that we need everyone to buy into and work together on. Council, state government, federal government, services and our local community need to work together to solve this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased that housing and homelessness has been elevated to cabinet in the government that I'm now a part of. We have a plan through the Housing Australia Future Fund. Importantly, we have a plan to work with state and local councils for all levels of government to come together to do what we can to pull all the levers to end homelessness. It's the least our constituents deserve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  Homelessness is a complex social and economic problem. It can be the result of relationship breakdown, family violence, unemployment and mental health issues, and, in most cases, a combination of these. Everyone deserves a home—a place to feel safe, welcome and accepted. National Homelessness Week is being launched today with the theme 'to end homelessness we need a plan'. I'm proud to participate this afternoon in the launch of the Yarra Ranges Homelessness Week 2022 broadcast, where we will engage in a conversation with local charities and the council about the progress and strategies around this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Casey, unfortunately, homelessness is a major local issue. In the 2016 census there were 360 people in Casey experiencing homelessness. However, I know through conversations with local organisations that this number is under-reported. In Casey we have some wonderful services and organisations, supported by governments, providing practical and sustainable assistance to local people in their time of need. Most people need temporary assistance and, once given a helping hand, will be able to go on to support themselves and their family. In 2021, almost 278,000 people around Australia were provided with assistance, equating to 1.1 per cent of the Australian population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Casey we have many great organisations that support this, like Anchor, which is located in Lilydale, which provides outreach to Healesville, Yarra Junction and Warburton for those who cannot come into the office. It provides information and referrals for those in need, with the goal to transition people into long-term, sustainable housing. They're helping rough sleepers and people needing food assistance or emergency accommodation. We're also lucky to have the Philanthropic Collective, run by Andrew, which provides food relief for those in the Dandenongs. I was fortunate, earlier this year, to help Andrew and his team pack hampers and support those in need when they need that temporary support. I'm looking forward to continuing to support Andrew and his team this year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Redwood Community Centre in Warburton provides food relief and phone support for those in need in the Upper Yarra, in Casey, while the Yarra Ranges Housing Action Group coordinates all the areas of Casey to make sure we can support those who need it. I'm very fortunate that my good friend Neal Taylor runs Holy Fools, which is a for-impact charity designed to support those in need in Lilydale and the surrounding urban areas. I've known Neal for about five years, and his organisation has been running for 12 years. He's organising today's event, and I want to pay tribute to Neal for the work that he does for the homeless people in Casey and for the support he provides to them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're doing a lot locally and we have a lot of great organisations supporting homelessness, we need to understand that we're facing significant economic challenges, which put further pressure on our local organisations and those across the country with regard to homelessness. We're facing high inflation and we've got rising interest rates, and that's going to put even more pressure on our most vulnerable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ultimate solution here is for the government to have a plan to address these rising cost-of-living pressures. Unfortunately, last week, when we heard from the Treasurer, he was looking in the rear-vision mirror, back at the last government, and criticising, not looking forward to providing a solution for those most vulnerable in the country. We're going to see an interest rate rise tomorrow, which is going to put more pressure on people's budgets. We need a plan from this government to address solutions now, not in September or in October. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment is currently at 3.5 per cent, and we know that the greatest solution to reduce homelessness and pressure on our most vulnerable is a job. So, as we face these challenges of high inflation and rising interest rates, the government need to ensure that they keep unemployment as low as possible, because it's not about a number. It's not about 3.5 per cent. It's about the people that are behind this number. This is the challenge that this government faces. We need our Treasurer to stop looking backwards in the rear-view mirror and to look forward, because a rising tide lifts all boats. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while I welcome the government's commitment to develop a new national housing and homelessness plan, with the support and assistance of key stakeholders, I hope they can include some of my local organisations, like Holy Fools and Anchor, so they can contribute to this plan. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  The Albanese Labor government recognise the deep and systemic challenges around homelessness throughout our nation, and we are serious about our plan to deal with homelessness and housing insecurity, which is a growing crisis in this nation. Few things can be as daunting as a lack of certainty around where you'll sleep at night. We all know that homelessness takes many different forms. It can be sleeping rough, couch surfing, living in your car or bouncing between temporary accommodation and mates' places. We also know that there are many other challenges around housing, including affordability, quality and overcrowding, which is a particular problem in the Northern Territory. Our federal government is committed to engaging across the sector, and that's why we've elevated the housing and homelessness portfolios back into cabinet. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how serious a problem homelessness is from my time as the NT CEO of St Vincent de Paul Society. I'm still a volunteer with Vinnies and recently look part in the CEO sleepout. The profoundly negative impacts of homelessness are obvious. It robs far too many people in our communities of the stability and security needed to flourish and to thrive, and we can't let these issues fester unaddressed. We can't allow more vulnerable people in our community to fall through the cracks. We see certain groups overrepresented far too often, whether it's people fleeing domestic violence, young people, people with disabilities or mental health issues, veterans, the elderly or people who straddle several of these cohorts. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Territorian I also welcome the $200 million committed to housing works in remote Aboriginal communities. Knowing the serious issues in these communities, I know this will make a real difference. The problems around quality of housing in remote communities mean that First Nations people are often living in very overcrowded conditions, with up to 20 people living in a three-bedroom house. There are then the knock-on problems with health and sanitation and disruption to kids' sleep and schooling—those social determinants of health. It also creates a bigger reliance on the public housing in Darwin, which is already strained.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the NT we have wonderful organisations working in this space, such as Yilli Rreung Housing, and I want to acknowledge the board of Yilli and in particular the CEO, Leeanne Caton. Yilli manage 246 properties and have 40 staff, helping to provide housing, which means that more families can have certainty around where they live and sleep. That includes temporary accommodation for those visiting from the communities, so they can be safe when they visit town for various reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also very committed to veterans and our first responders, who face housing insecurity from time to time. More than housing insecurity, they can experience homelessness. I think some of the evidence given so far to the royal commission into veteran suicides has shown that. On separation from the ADF—and I've been there, as you have, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie—you can be a bit lost sometimes. I understand that. So I was very proud to secure $3 million for a veterans and first responders supported housing hub in my electorate of Darwin. The Scott Palmer service centre, named for Commando Scott Palmer—the only Territorian killed in Afghanistan—will be focused on providing services, accommodation, family support and recreation facilities for those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. The primary goal is to assist our veterans and our first responders to secure permanent accommodation in social housing or in the private rental market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I pushed very hard for the royal commission, because I knew that there were systemic problems in the way we supported our men and women in uniform. The same goes for first responders. I think the evidence has pointed to a need for this supported accommodation, with case management and referrals to DVA and organisations such as Open Arms, health professionals and employment services. A supported accommodation facility will save lives. I commend the member for Macnamara for bringing forward this motion, and I know that this government is going to get on with helping our homelessness situation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I thank the member for Macnamara for giving me another opportunity to speak on this topic that I'm so passionate about—homelessness—which absolutely affects my Gold Coast community. In fact, I just came back from returning to the Gold Coast on the weekend for a homelessness fundraiser for the St Johns Crisis Centre based in Surfers Paradise. They look after those in our city who are in crisis—those single mums and children who are living in cars in my community. In Homelessness Week, my thoughts go out to those who are living in that crisis situation. I thank St Johns Crisis Centre for the $200,000-odd that we raised on Saturday at the Gold Coast Turf Club. Also, a couple of months ago my community came together in the Gold Coast CEO sleepout, and we raised $630,000 for our local community on the Gold Coast for those living in the crisis conditions of homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What members haven't done in this debate today is ask: why? Why does the Gold Coast community have to come together to raise funds for homelessness in Queensland? I'll tell you why. It's because the Labor Palaszczuk government haven't delivered what they should be delivering for homelessness in Queensland. There are 50,000 people on the homelessness register in Queensland, and it is a disgrace. I'm on record asking the Auditor-General what Queensland have done with the $335-odd million that our federal government, under Scott Morrison, delivered to Queensland last year for social housing. Palaszczuk herself has actually been in the paper admitting that the Queensland government have spent only $200 million out of the $2 billion worth of funding that they have in their budget for social housing. Yet the member for Surfers Paradise, my state member, tells me that there is only one room in Surfers Paradise for those people needing social housing. So we have a situation on the Gold Coast where St John's Crisis Centre in Surfer's Paradise, St Vincent de Paul—known as Vinnies—and Rotary International clubs, including my local Rotary club, are raising funds to help the homeless in our city because the state government, the Labor Palaszczuk government, are not doing what they need to be doing to deliver social and affordable housing to the good people of the Gold Coast. It is simply not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do more about homelessness, and I'm hoping—actually, it is a bit of an ironic situation when we've got interest rates skyrocketing and inflation out of control—that we might actually see Gold Coasters start to open some of the second or third rooms in their homes to those people who can't afford to live in our city anymore because of this situation of unaffordable housing. I'm hoping that in the short term this will be the solution. It's certainly not the Albanese government that is racing to the aid of those who find themselves in this position of homelessness. As to what the state Labor governments are doing, we've heard from Queensland federal members talking about what's happening in Queensland, but we've also heard from Victorian members. Notably, both states are under Labor governments that haven't done their job when it comes to delivering for homelessness and delivering affordable social housing for those members of our community who need extra help. It's not good enough, and the state governments absolutely need to lift their game to help those in our community, especially on the Gold Coast, who find themselves living in their cars or who find themselves living on the streets in Southport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to that, I will add that my local council, to their credit—including Councillor Brooke Patterson, to her credit—have actually established two local council officers to go around and help the homeless people living to our city in Southport and also in Surfers Paradise, where Councillor Darren Taylor is also doing a great job in trying to help individuals who find themselves in that position—one by one, helping them out with wraparound services like St John's Crisis Centre, the Gold Coast Project for Homeless Youth and Vinnies, who are assisting in this space. I thank, lastly, members of my community who put the money on the table to help the most vulnerable living on the Gold Coast, who need a hand up.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a relief it was that the coalition was elected in September 2013, for many, many reasons but particularly for the fate of the NBN rollout. Of course, we never could have imagined—no-one could have predicted—what sort of requirements would be on that National Broadband Network when the COVID pandemic struck and an enormous burden on internet provision, particularly in private homes, suddenly came into effect because, of course, through the pandemic, people needed to isolate. Sometimes they were under a work-from-home direction. Certainly we all remember the experiences that we all had in using our homes as a workplace—in some states for quite an extended period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, by the time we had this enormous burden in place, there had been an enormous change to the rollout of the National Broadband Network, commencing with the change of government in September 2013. At that time, the previous Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government had connected the NBN to 51,000 homes in six years, at a cost of $6 billion. At that breakneck speed, by the time the COVID pandemic struck we might have had a little over 100,000 homes connected to the NBN if Labor had stayed in power. Of course, they didn't. The government changed, and we dramatically changed our approach to rolling out the NBN, which saw us look to roll it out as rapidly as possible and to connect as many homes as possible as quickly as we possibly could in the most efficient cost model. That has seen, from the most recent figures, more than 12 million premises across the country have access to the NBN. Around 8½ million connections are in place. This was all achieved between September 2013 and the May election in 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is extremely significant because, when we had the enormous burden put onto the NBN through an unpredictable requirement of connections throughout the homes of Australia, thanks to the coalition's rollout of the NBN we had the service there ready for people. Under Labor, if they continued at the pace in which they were rolling out their expensive and slow version of the NBN, we might have seen barely 100,000 properties or more connected to the network if you extrapolate it out. Instead, we now have around 12 million properties that can connect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This puts the NBN in a very strong position, obviously having that customer base, to now undertake further investments into that capability. It's certainly the vision of our side of politics that the NBN is a financially sustainable, growing business that is repaying the Commonwealth for the investment into that infrastructure that we have made. It's also our vision that, by virtue of having that extremely large customer base, the NBN is able to invest in further enhancement of internet services, particularly increasing speeds, to businesses, communities and households throughout the country, particularly making sure that we're investing in increasing the standard of services in regional and remote communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is all happening. Minister Fletcher made significant announcements over the last two years to enhance investment in both regional and remote connection speeds but also, of course, the business fibre network system that allows businesses to access speeds of up to one gigabyte per second. That is quite phenomenal and is transformative for certain businesses, particularly, I might say, in health care and the health system. That extremely high-speed availability of data and connectivity is transformative around health technology and the ability to provide healthcare services in new and innovative ways into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is an opportunity to note the very significant achievements under the NBN in both connecting a record number of Australian households, rolling out the scheme to more than 12 million sites across the nation, and being there when it was most important, particularly during the pandemic, to provide Australians with connectivity through the National Broadband Network. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I did have a little bit of a chuckle to myself when I saw this motion pop up. Those who've been in this place for a while would know that this isn't actually a new motion. This motion has been moved by former government members several times. They've just recycled a little bit of old homework, deleting 'government' and putting in 'opposition'. They're trying to rewrite history again with this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the former Rudd-Gillard government first decided that it would build the NBN network, the plan was for the majority of Australian households—in fact, over 93 per cent of Australian households—to get fibre to the premises. That was the plan. That was what was being rolled out. Unfortunately, that Labor government lost power in 2013 before the real significant build started. What we then had from the incoming coalition government was a debacle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back then, Malcolm Turnbull became Minister for Communications and tore up the plan which would have seen 93-plus per cent of households get fibre to the premises. They introduced their mixed plan where they had fibre to the node, they used a cable, they had more houses on satellite and they had more houses on the fixed-wireless network. They promised that it would be built and that people would be on the NBN sooner, faster and cheaper, by 2016, but they failed. They failed to build it sooner, failed to make it cheaper—failed in it altogether.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, under the former government we saw, as strange as this sounds, manufacturing facilities overseas having to ramp up their production capacity for copper wire because, rather than replacing old, degraded copper that was in the ground with fibre optics as the rest of the world were doing, the former government decided—because they were so wedded to their fibre-to-the-node plan—that, where there was degraded copper, they needed new copper. So much copper was required that overseas manufacturers had to reopen factories. That's how out of date the former government's policy was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate, a regional electorate, a whole bunch of towers were built when Julia Gillard was Prime Minister. That's how long ago these towers were built. But then the coalition was elected on 7 September 2013. These towers weren't turned on. They were put in the too-hard basket. Yet the government hadn't informed the other side of the business—the retailers—that the towers hadn't been turned on. So we started to get these complaints coming in. This is an example of how incompetent the previous government were. People were being sold a product that they could attach to the NBN through the fixed wireless network. Only when the technician came out did they discover that in their area the tower had not been switched on, and it took forever to get to the bottom of why these towers hadn't been switched on. So we had the frustration of people who were trying to buy internet access—buy their NBN package—but couldn't because the tower wasn't switched on. We found out that one of the towers had been rejected through planning. The solution of the government back then was to fix the nine towers in the area back to one relay tower, when it was supposed to be five towers to one relay tower. It meant that the people at the very end of the service got poor-quality internet. They had very slow speeds. This is the legacy of that government, and mine is just one electorate. Every electorate has a horror-story track record of the previous government and what they did to what was going to be a revolutionary change that would get every house the internet speeds that it needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the new Labor government did for those fixed wireless networks on coming into government has increased the speeds. One of the first acts of the minister, Michelle Rowland, was to increase the speeds for regional communities who rely upon the fixed wireless network. It's been fantastic for people relying on that service, whether they be students who are studying from home or people working from home. They are now getting the download speeds that they were promised. But it took the election of a Labor government to fix it. We are rolling out more fibre to the premises. We can't roll it out everywhere, but we're rolling it out where we can, because fibre is better than copper, something that took the previous government almost a decade to work out and took this government to fix. As for this motion, I strongly suggest that the opposition go back and start again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  Deputy Speaker Buchholz, congratulations on sitting in the chair. It is good to see you here today. I thank the member for Sturt for bringing this motion forward to talk about the NBN, the National Broadband Network, which has revolutionised Australia. Let's face it: it's changed the way we do business. In my electorate of Moncrieff there are 36,000 small businesses, so fast broadband is pretty important when it comes to doing business and how we catch up with our friends and our family, especially during COVID, when we all use the internet so much at home. Fast internet really played a vital role in the day-to-day during COVID. The way that we were able to work from home and respond to the pandemic, I think, really highlighted how important broadband is, including the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've watched how it's impacted on everyday lives and is changing the way that we do things, making it easier, making it better for Australians and making it faster. I've seen firsthand how having fast internet has, as I said, impacted thousands of those small businesses in my electorate and around the country. Some businesses no longer require bricks and mortar, which means small business can be run from home, and we've seen that growing trend across Australia during COVID. That helps working mums to work from home and look after their kids and have a bit of flexibility in their working lives, thanks to broadband that is fast enough. And it's helped to boost productivity across the nation, and to foster innovation, and has allowed small and medium-sized businesses and enterprises to embrace opportunities for growth in a different way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the NBN wasn't always great. I'm sure many in this place remember what the NBN was like under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor government—or what it wasn't like, given that, after six years and $6 billion, only 51,000 premises were connected to the NBN. Labor love to take credit for the NBN, and they love to pretend that the NBN is how it is today is because of them. But in reality it was a complete and utter shambles under those opposite, and I'm sure many Australians have realised by now that, when Labor make a mess, it's usually a pretty big one and the coalition have to come in to scoop it all up and fix it all up—and that's exactly what we did with the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to say that our strong economic record and our investments in the NBN have made it what it is today. After nine years of the coalition, there are now more than 8.4 million premises connected to the NBN and more than 12 million premises ready to connect. That's quite an incredible number—double. It is a stark difference, and it's further proof that, no matter what Labor say, they cannot be trusted when it comes to the NBN. There are a few other things they can't be trusted with, but I won't go into those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's our government who delivered the NBN efficiently and economically when Australians needed it most. When did Australians need it most? It was during these last couple of years of pandemic, when Australians needed to be in contact with loved ones all around the world. In fact, many Australians haven't seen their loved ones for a couple of years, so it was really important to have NBN fast internet at home while people were in periods of isolation and during lockdowns. It was the glue that kept families together, when you break it down. It was high-speed internet that allowed families to communicate around the globe and interstate when they weren't able to connect face to face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our government, the NBN stood the test of COVID-19 and will continue to be a driving force in our strong economic recovery. If we'd left those opposite in charge, the cost would have tripled and Australians would still be waiting for fast internet. What does that mean for the future? Well, it means a future under a Labor Albanese government, who couldn't figure out their own policies, so they just copied ours. That's what they do on the other side: when they can't find their own policies, they copy ours. But the data does speak for itself: 51,000 over six years versus 12 million ready to connect. They are stark figures, and it was under our government that the NBN was delivered to the country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  There's no doubt that the NBN needed to be the first and most significant major infrastructure investment program of the 21st century. It was the big missing piece when it came to national infrastructure in Australia, and it is a shambles. It's been delivered in an awful, terrible, slow, expensive and substandard way. We essentially have a network that is obsolete on delivery. And I'm astounded to be standing here on the first Monday of a new parliamentary term, in the second week, to find that the motions being brought by the opposition include this one. I mean, you'd only do that if the general instructions were, 'Let's go and have debates on literally the small handful of the most terrible things we did over the last nine years.' It is just ridiculous. We had the new member for Casey saying that he didn't think this parliament should be looking in the rear-view mirror. You can understand why the opposition would take that view; that's in keeping with their new policy of mass collective amnesia about what has passed over the previous nine years. People around the suburbs should keep watch over their wing mirrors, because rear-view mirrors, wing mirrors and everything else are at great risk under the approach of the opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we had the member for Sturt, who brought the motion, begin this debate by saying, 'Let's celebrate the 2013 election of the coalition government.' Here we are—it's a new parliament—and he kicked off this debate by saying, 'Let's celebrate.' I don't know how many rear-view mirrors are swinging in his office, but the member for Casey might want to go around and have a look. Some of them probably need to be collected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's the reality? The reality is that we're the 13th-largest economy in the world, but we've got broadband speeds that place us 60-something in the world. That's the reality, right? The reality is that those opposite decided to abandon a plan for a fibre-rich network using 21st-century technology and double down on 19th-century telephone copper wire. We became one of the largest purchasers of copper wire on the planet, because their approach to the NBN was akin to someone starting an airline by going around and trying to superglue wings onto a train. That's more or less the approach that was taken by those opposite. The network that we have was obsolete on delivery. We have people in rural and regional Australia using satellite, sometimes fixed wireless, or literally driving from property to property to borrow the internet—just as you might go next door to borrow a cup of milk—because they need to do systems upgrades or need access to downloads for the sake of their children's education. We have people in a seat like mine, the division of Fremantle, using satellite on the urban fringe of capital cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a plan, if that's what it is, that was supposed to be $29 billion and delivered by 2016; it's not complete now and is at $58 billion plus—a plan that involved an equity investment by the government but where the rest of the financing was supposed to come from the private sector. No-one in the private sector wanted to lend money to the NBN. The government stepped in and did that, so we've got this massively slow and over-budget exercise that has given Australia, in the year 2022—we're nearly a quarter into the 21st century—an absolute disaster of a broadband network. We know precisely what is required to enable families and households to participate in telehealth and tele-education—things that became even more important in the course of the pandemic—and we know the kind of speeds, networking and accessibility that businesses need to improve productivity and connect to the wider world, especially from an island continent. Yet we've got this disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it astounding—astonishing—that, on the first Monday of a new parliamentary term, opposition members bowl up and want to talk about the NBN and what a great job they've done. It's over cost, slow and absolutely awful, and, of course, we are now going back to the sensible plan, which was a fibre-rich network for the 21st century. Yet someone before—I think it was the member for Moncrieff—was suggesting that it's the opposition, it's the coalition, that cleans up the mess that the Labor Party makes. We are literally standing in the smouldering ruin. How on earth anyone from that side can make reference to a mess that needs cleaning up and not have a ridiculous grin on their face is beyond me, but that's where we are. The NBN's a disaster, and we'll clean it up.</span>

How great it is to see you enthroned again, your dulcet tones presiding over us. I'll try to hold back a ridiculous grin, but may I say, long may we celebrate the 2013 election win.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion speaks to three things I would like to raise that are very important. This is the story of infrastructure and infrastructure delivery, and the two very different approaches that we see. Usually, when we talk about infrastructure in seats like yours and mine, Mr Deputy Speaker, we're talking about the roads, the rail, the bridges—the things we expect to see—and we have a strong record of delivering that. The Second Range Crossing coming from your area into mine, Inland Rail as it progresses—these sorts of things that we see, the tangible infrastructure, do so much for us, and we come to rely upon our government to deliver this infrastructure regionally. In fact, the growth of our regions relies upon that regional investment from this side of the House. This is as true of hard infrastructure as it is of digital infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is such an important point for our future. Whilst the roads and the bridges are the things that allow us to do business and take our goods to market, digital infrastructure is important for us as we progress our ideas of regionalisation. Broadening our local economies requires new industries coming into our areas. Without that investment, we don't get the benefits of these new economies, these new technologies, coming into our areas. We absolutely saw that throughout the pandemic. In my area of Groom we had people flooding out of the cities, running away—I know this was the case across Australia, but it was so strong in Groom—and coming to live in Groom, to experience city life in a regional setting that they couldn't have elsewhere. It is certainly almost a unique proposition in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What enabled that was not just a desire to experience that lifestyle. What enabled it was the ability to do business in our area. For example, C-suite professionals or people in management consultancies or high-tech businesses were able to come and—originally just via Zoom, temporarily—operate their businesses for a little while out of a regional base. But slowly they realised they could stay there long term, and they have. We've seen that investment come into our regions. We've seen that new industry and the broadening of our economy happen, and it's prevalent everywhere. The evidence of it is in our house prices and the vacancy rates in our rentals. This has happened. It happened because we had the digital infrastructure in place, because we had the NBN delivered. The approach that we took was a needs based approach, to get it done so that the work could take place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very interesting. I pick up the notes of previous speakers admitting that, whilst their approach was for fibre everywhere, they couldn't roll fibre out everywhere, and, of course, you can't. We found that out. What we did was put in the program that was best placed to deliver the needs of the people, to make sure that it was their needs that were achieved, not our high and lofty positions. What we did was deliver for the people of Australia so that that growth could happen, particularly in the regions. I think that that's a difference in approach that was fundamental and was admitted almost straight up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part is to suggest that it is a failed delivery. I would humbly submit that everyone who has enjoyed the benefits of a Zoom meeting out in the bush may have a different view, because it did work, it has been used and it has driven work in our regions. This is a different approach to infrastructure delivery, perhaps, to the opposite side's. It's one that gets it done. It puts the good above the perfect, and it deals with the needs of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the third point that this speaks to, really, is small business. The people who benefited most from this are the small businesses around Australia, again regionally. Toowoomba is an absolute hotbed for small businesses, as we slowly, piece by piece, build a new economy that enables families to have an additional source of income. It's fantastic, and it's been possible to do it because we invested in this infrastructure. I'm very happy to support this motion because—far be it from me to say this—it reminds Australia that this is why we do what we do. This is what's important: that we can deliver these assets to the Australian people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's week 1 of the new parliament, and the government is implementing our promise to abolish the Liberal and National parties' cruel cashless debit card scheme. It's insidious privatised welfare, and, under this government, it's going to go. The day that bill passes will be called 'liberation day' for the thousands of Australians who were forced onto this card in the so-called trial sites. It's actually been spreading like a cancer, because once you were forced onto this card in those trial sites, if you moved elsewhere in the country—including in my electorate—it was almost impossible to get off this card. The bill will also protect the millions of Australians who would have been subjected to forced income management had the opposition won the election. What a relief!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government's plans were clear: despite no compelling evidence, they were going to force all social security recipients onto this cruel card, including pensioners. The former Prime Minister called it the universal platform. A former minister said it would be subject to a nationwide expansion. Then, when sprung, they tried to deny their own words. They forgot that the television actually recorded what they said. They introduced legislation to force pensioners onto the card but then pretended they hadn't. They would have taken 80 per cent of a social security recipient's payment and forced it onto this card, meaning people couldn't go and buy fresh food at the market; couldn't pay cash for second-hand goods; couldn't buy a cheap meal down at the RSL if they sold alcohol there; and couldn't give cash to their grandkids for their birthday. The government and a private company, the Liberal Party and the National Party thought, should control what people spend their own money on. The only people who benefited were a private company that ran this card. A hundred and seventy million dollars was wasted on this by the Liberals and Nationals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's principles for income management are clear: (1) it should be voluntary; (2) it should not be privatised; (3) it should be supported by evidence, not prejudice or bigotry or assertions or good ideas; and (4) it should be subject to ongoing evaluation. The government's bill delivers on these principles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Principle No. 1 is that it should be voluntary. Individuals or communities that want income management should have it. We will liberate the trial sites, and there are consultations underway which will return self-determination to Aboriginal communities, a welcome contrast to the government's former scheme. As a Senate report and others found, it was tantamount to being a racist scheme because it disproportionately impacted Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including in the trial sites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, it should be non-privatised. Citizens have a right to deal with public servants when asking for permission on how to spend their own money if they're on income management. They should not have to beg a private company for permission on how to spend their cash. Labor does not support privatised welfare, and the Liberals and Nationals do. That's what it boils down to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, it should be supported by evidence. I think almost the worst and most dishonest aspect was the repeated untruths of the former government and former ministers that this scheme somehow helped people. There was simply no credible evidence over the years. I can understand and accept to some degree that this was a trial. I can understand it. The former government put forward this idea and said it would be a trial, it would be evaluated and it would be subject to evidence. That's what they said. That was the legislation that was passed, including with the support, initially, of Labor, the then opposition. But after years the Auditor-General found in two separate reports—not once but twice the Auditor-General looked at this scheme—that there was simply no proper evidentiary basis. The former government committed multiple times to do a proper independent evaluation of the scheme, but they did not do so, and they broke their own promise. They said this would be a trial, it would be temporary and they'd evaluate it, and then they brought legislation into the parliament to make the trial sites permanent and allow them to be expanded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard in question time last week the Leader of the Opposition misquoting the University of Adelaide report and confusing correlation with causation. There was no evidence that the card decreased drug and alcohol use. It's assertion. So the former government relied on stereotypes and prejudice—stereotypes that people on social security can't spend their own money. If you ask a pensioner or anyone who is on social security, they know where every cent of their money goes. It is prejudice—as one member admitted to me quietly, 'Well, it's just red meat to our base, isn't it?'—and racist stereotypes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that this card did more harm than good. The final thing I'd say, from talking to pensioners around the country, is that, if you get to an older age, you know someone who's had a drug or alcohol problem, and the truth is that they always find a way around this card. It did more harm than good, and I'm glad it's being abolished by this government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  This is one of the more serious motions that we will debate in this chamber, and soon we'll debate it in the House of Representatives when the repeal legislation is before us. I was the architect of the cashless debit card, designing it and implementing it in concert with Indigenous leaders in Ceduna, the East Kimberley and Goldfields. But that is not the reason I am so passionately against the card's repeal. Rather, my passion comes from having worked in and around Indigenous issues for over 20 years now, including as Noel Pearson's deputy director, and seeing firsthand how much damage alcohol abuse paid with welfare cash has on remote communities. My passion comes from seeing how little impact the hundreds of other programs and services have had on addressing this damage. And it comes from seeing that the cashless debit card, while not a panacea, was making an impact like few other initiatives ever have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alcohol paid for by the taxpayer through welfare payments is the poison that runs through remote communities, causing devastation that is almost incomprehensible. People have told me that in some of these communities almost every girl has been sexually abused. It is known in some places that a quarter of all children are born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, effectively brain-damaged for life. The assault rate against women is simply off the charts and would never be tolerated in our cities. Some years ago, for example, the Northern Territory government released figures showing that 11 in 100 women were bashed every year and that two-thirds of that was related to alcohol consumption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all been complicit in this carnage, because for too long we've stood by and handed over the welfare cash, knowing how it is spent and the damage it does. The cashless debit card changed this. It was deliberately designed to stop the flow of welfare cash being spent on alcohol, on drugs and on gambling. It did this through quite clever technology. In essence, we issued a Visa debit card to each working-age welfare recipient and placed 80 per cent of their welfare payments onto this card. This card looked and operated like any other Visa debit card, such as the one you might have in your pocket, with the exception of three things. You couldn't use it to purchase alcohol at the bottle shops, you couldn't use it to gamble at the gambling houses and you couldn't take cash out with it. We were getting results with this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are few initiatives which make a difference in Indigenous communities, but this was one. Consider the evaluation from the University of Adelaide. Forty-five per cent of cardholders said it had improved things for them and their family. They stated that there was clear evidence that alcohol consumption had reduced. There was evidence that it had been helping to reduce gambling. They found that safety had been improved in these communities. Anecdotally, people reported that people were now buying trolley loads full of groceries at Coles rather than just shopping bags full. The Ceduna mayor said that it had been the best the community had ever been, following the introduction of the card. I challenge the Labor Party to name a single initiative that has ever had such an impact in these remote communities, which we know are so challenged. Soon this will be gone, if Labor gets its way, not because it wasn't having a practical impact—it clearly was—but for ideological reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To say that I am disappointed is an understatement. I am angry about Labor's decision, and so should every reasonable citizen of this country be, because not only are they removing an initiative that is working but, worse, when the card comes off it will lead to a flood of welfare cash entering those communities, which will result in only one thing: more violence against women, and more children being neglected. That will be on the Labor Party. If they don't know that it will have this impact then they are being wilfully blind. The additional shame is that Labor has not consulted the brave Indigenous leaders who pushed so strongly to institute the card—people like Corey McClellan in Ceduna, Ian Trust in the East Kimberley and Betty Logan in Goldfields. So much for listening to Indigenous voices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor Party MPs know that, tonight, their own children will sleep soundly, secure in their nice suburban homes. Meanwhile, hundreds of kilometres away, they are about to unleash hell on innocent children and women in remote communities. Shame on the Labor Party.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles"> Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  Deputy Speaker Buchholz, congratulations on your election to the Speaker's panel. It's very fine to see you there. It is a great pleasure to join with my colleague the member for Bruce in welcoming the end of the cashless debit card in what is my first speech in this new term of parliament. It's almost painful to sit here and listen to the hubris from the other side of the House about how this card has had amazing outcomes and how there has been a lack of consultation on our part with Aboriginal communities. Aboriginal communities who want to can have this card; it can be voluntary. Let's see how many of those communities actually do volunteer to take it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad I am here. I'm glad this is my first speech on this topic, because I remember the number of speeches that were made by members of the then opposition, including me, calling on the previous government to get rid of the cruel, punitive cashless debit card scheme. So, as we have profoundly done on so many issues—aged care, climate, family and domestic violence—we've got on with the job, moving legislation to deliver our commitment in the very first week of parliament for our government, making this a better country. Prior to the election, we spoke of all the reasons why this country would be better for having a Labor government, and, following the election, as I've chatted to my constituents back in Cooper and to people around the country, they speak of a sense of relief, of a weight that has been lifted from government since the end of the former government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this will particularly be felt by those people who were previously forced onto income management under the cashless debit card. Life under the card was difficult. It robbed people who received social security payments of their independence. It was a punitive scheme which sent the message that people on social security could not be trusted with their own money. We heard stories of community members who wanted to pop $20 in a birthday card for the grandkids but couldn't. There were stories of people who had a corner store down the road that wouldn't accept the card, so, rather than walking down the street to grab a carton of milk and a paper on a Saturday morning, they had to get in a taxi and go to town to do so, costing them more of their precious dollars. The restrictions this scheme placed on peoples lives were absurd. They did not deliver the outcomes for communities, and they robbed recipients of their independence and their dignity. Shamefully, it was a scheme which targeted First Nations communities, robbing them of self-determination, forcing those communities onto the card without proper consultation. It was an awful, discriminatory policy of the former government, one which our government is proud to put an end to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that the cashless debit card was a classic example of the utmost waste of the former government. When we talk about the waste of the former government, how's this: $170 million worth of contracts to roll out a privatised social security program that communities didn't want and wasn't effective. They could have spent this money on programs that communities actually wanted and would have worked. Instead, they gave it out—without evidence, without evaluation and without any key performance indicators—in yet another rorted government contract to a service which took agency out of the hands of communities, particularly First Nations communities, and put it in the hands of a private, for-profit company. The former government should apologise for going down this path. It is a dark period in the history of social security in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has committed, and we are happy to make this crystal clear every single day, as we did during the election, to this: social security must be managed by the government. It should never have left the government's hands in the first place. We've made that commitment clear to all recipients, including pensioners. We'll never privatise social security, we'll never privatise the pension and we will continue to ensure the independence of recipients in how they spend their money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Income management is a matter for the individual to decide. If they want to take part, as I know one community has made clear in consultation with us, then, absolutely, the government can work with that community and those individuals on implementing the program. But what we will always commit to is the principle of self-determination, keeping decision-making with the communities themselves and working with them on solutions which have evidence and which communities tell us work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the many people who campaigned for so long against the cashless debit card, and in particular the First Nations peak bodies in my electorate who made submissions and met with me relentlessly on this issue. Your voices were strong, they were powerful and they have made this change. It's a credit to all of you, and I'm so proud our government has been able to work with you to put this legislation to parliament. I call on all members from across the parliament to support our bill and to put an end to the racist, discriminatory, ineffective cashless debit card once and for all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  The Prime Minister visited the Garma Festival in recent days in north-east Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory, and I commend him for doing that and for the genuine work he is doing with Aboriginal people and with all Australians. I want to be bipartisan on that. But I wonder how many people who attended that festival—I wonder how many women in particular—looked the Prime Minister in the eye and said, 'You're making a mistake about this cashless debit card withdrawal.' I wonder how many children looked at the Prime Minister and thought, 'There's the leader of our country.' These are children who, perhaps, in recent years, being children in an area where the cashless debit card was operating as a trial, had, for the first time, lunch at school; had, for the first time, food on the table; had, for the first time, a mother who wasn't being bashed at night. I wonder how many children who were there at that festival were in that position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card looks and operates like a regular bank card. It cannot be used to buy alcohol or gambling products—that's a good thing—or certain gift cards or to withdraw cash. The communities in which the card is operational include the Ceduna region of South Australia, the Goldfields and East Kimberley regions of WA, the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions—I appreciate that the member for Hinkler is here—and some Cape York communities, including Doomadgee, in Queensland, and the Northern Territory. I visited many of those electorates. I've talked to people affected and influenced by these trials, and they tell me it is a positive experience. I know that some women felt safer at night and, for the first time in a long time, rested easy at night, knowing that this trial was in place and that their partner wasn't going to bash them, that their partner was going to provide and that there was going to be money for the family to provide food for the children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision shows that this government clearly doesn't understand the harsh realities of particularly regional and remote Australia, where some Aboriginal women are subjected to domestic violence every night of every week. How tragic is that? As the new senator for the Northern Territory, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, said in her first speech, just last Wednesday:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We see the news that grog bans will be lifted on dry communities, allowing the scourge of alcoholism and the violence that accompanies it free reign, despite warnings from elders of those communities about the coming damage. Coupled with this, we see the removal of the cashless debit card, which allowed countless families on welfare to feed their children rather than seeing the money claimed by kinship demand from alcoholics, substance abusers and gamblers in their own family group. I could not offer two more appalling examples of legislation pushed by left-wing elites and guaranteed to worsen the lives of Indigenous people. Yet at the same time we spend days and weeks each year recognising Aboriginal Australia in many ways—in symbolic gestures that fail to push the needle one micro millimetre toward improving the lives of the most marginalised in any genuine way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, she is so right. She knows. She understands. She has spoken to so many people across the Territory and elsewhere. And, more than that, so many Australians have listened to Senator Nampijinpa Price, have seen her wonderful, groundbreaking maiden speech and understand exactly what she is saying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hinkler—we'll hear from him in a moment—has told me of the positive impact the cashless debit card has had in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions, where a trial has been placed. People have told him that it should continue. People have told him of their lived experience. It's all well and good for some city types of those opposite to talk about how dreadful this is. I heard the member for Bruce say 'cruel' and 'insidious'—it's Liberation Day; hallelujah! He described it as a cancer, a prejudice. That's totally wrong. It's totally out of touch. This trial is about ensuring that future generations in communities affected by alcoholics, sadly, gamblers, tragically, and substance abusers can eat a meal and can be supported in a way that can give them the best opportunity to break the cycle. I agree with the member for Bruce: it's insidious—because it is an insidious cycle. The cashless welfare debit card was doing just that—breaking this insidious cycle. I recommend it as a program. I know a lot of thought was put into it. Yes, perhaps on the edges there could have been some improvements—that certainly would have been the case—but I commend it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:10</span>):  I, too, rise to speak on this important motion, and I thank the member for Bruce for raising this topic. Before the election, we made a promise to Australian voters: that an Albanese Labor government would introduce legislation to parliament to abolish the cashless debit card. And that is exactly what we are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government saw the cashless debit card as an easy solution to all social problems. It even planned, as we know and as we've heard, to roll it out to further communities and to further groups, and this put a big panic in pensioners across the country. In other words, where would it stop? It could have seen your ordinary pensioner, who is law abiding and looks after their own affairs, be made to take out a cashless card.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Approximately 17,300 participants are currently in the scheme; of course, a disproportionate number of participants are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. All these participants will now be able to move off the cashless debit card, with the option of voluntary income management. And there are other ways, for people who, for whatever reason, don't have their finances in order and are continuously neglecting their family et cetera. There are schemes in place—and we see them all over the place, in other circumstances—that can be brought to fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've made this decision on the basis of extensive community consultation, including with First Nations community leaders, service providers and cashless debit card participants in these communities. We've heard them loud and clear. They told us that the cashless debit card disenfranchises people and does not allow them to take an active role in their lives. For example, it makes participants' lives, in some cases, much more difficult because they cannot access their money to buy the basic goods that they require to feed their children, their family et cetera. If they wanted to complain or to discuss it, or if there was a dispute over these issues, it was extremely difficult to be heard. They needed to engage with a private company instead of with the government agency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another problem within itself. Under the previous government, the cashless debit card was not run by the government; it was not run by the department; it was run by a privatised company. What's more, there was no evidence that the scheme was helping people on a large scale. In fact, the Auditor-General, in two independent reports to parliament in 2018 and 2022, found that there were no key performance indicators or evidence to support the scheme. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are listening and we're putting choice back into the system—choice. Anyone currently on the cashless debit card who wants to exit the scheme will be able to do so, and anyone on the scheme who wishes to remain, on a voluntary basis, on income management will be able to use this basic card. We want to make income management truly voluntary. This will give people back control over their own lives and their finances. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to listening to the First Nations communities, community groups and, indeed, all Australians about this issue. We want to make sure that all Australians—and not a private company—have a say over the things that govern them. The previous government wasted nearly over $170 million on this scheme. This is money that could have been invested directly in the services that local communities need, to assist them, to get them back on their feet or to assist their families. We want to ensure that we're helping communities and not harming them. We want to return self-determination to Indigenous communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Income management is an important tool for social welfare. However, any income management should be voluntary, non-privatised, supported by evidence and subject to ongoing evaluation. Sadly, the previous government's cashless debit card scheme was an insidious form of privatised welfare. We don't want to see anyone held back. We want everyone to have the opportunities to live their life in accordance with their dreams and their aspirations. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  Labor's proposition on the cashless debit card is pretty straightforward. They intend to remove it, and they will replace it—and I'm sure you'll be surprised at this, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker—with nothing, with absolutely nothing! In fact, we had some $30 million in additional support services committed to those trial sites, and yet the minister will not commit to continuing that funding—$30 million worth of services. I will give those opposite an opportunity here, because I think they've just been significantly misinformed. I am sure it's just straight off the talking points. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have in front of me table 3.4, 'Assessment of 2020–21 performance measures for the Cashless Debit Card' of the ANAO report. Guess what it says. There are four columns, headed 'Reliable (data)', 'Verifiable (method)', 'Free from bias' and 'Related'. The first item is the 'extent to which the CDC supports a reduction in social harm in communities'. The report finds that it 'fully and/or mostly meets requirements'. The report actually says it meets the requirements for reduction in social harm in communities. The second item is the 'extent to which participants are using their CDC to direct income support payments to essential goods and services, including to support the wellbeing of the participant.' Guess what? It 'fully and/or mostly meets requirements' in the areas 'Reliable (data)' and 'Related', but unfortunately not in 'Verifiable (method)' or 'Free from bias'. If you read the report, you see that it is scathing of the department for not doing what the minister directed. They simply didn't do the work. So what is being put forward by those opposite is complete nonsense. It is just not true. We have a report that supports the rollout of the CDC and that supports the trials in the areas in which they are in place, because it makes a difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those opposite who may or may not live in a city, who may or may not live in an area where these are very difficult issues, we have communities that simply want action. I am pleased to see the member for Grey here. He was first out of the gates. It is a very tough issue; it is incredibly difficult, but we have a Labor Party that is absolutely bound to idealistic views. They are not bound to get an outcome; it is all about idealism. It is all about the Socialist Alliance. It's all about the people from Sydney or Melbourne. It is us that have to live in these communities. The reason it is supported is that it actually works. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear all this stuff about how they have consulted with the community, as they committed to during the election campaign, before making any changes. I'll tell you what the consultation looked like in my electorate before we rolled this out. The Department of Social Services conducted over 188 meetings in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. This included five meetings with Commonwealth government agencies, 19 with community members, three with community reference groups, two large community meetings with the public, 25 with local government reps, four with peak bodies and 55 with service providers. My office alone contacted 32,000 constituents to get an indication of their views before the trial was even put forward. That's a pretty big proportion of 107,000 voters. We sent 32,000 individuals direct mail, we phone polled 500 people and we sent 5½ thousand direct emails, and, would you believe, the feedback we had was 75 per cent support. The media did not believe that, so they did what was known as a ReachTEL poll, which I'm sure those opposite have heard of. Guess what? There were 27.8 per cent that were opposed—that's all. They know it makes a difference. They know it is tough; it is difficult policy. But they put it in place and they support it in the community because it works. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We keep hearing about people being able to spend their own money. This is taxpayer support for individuals who are in a very difficult position. Are those opposite seriously suggesting that more than 20 per cent of an individual's payment, whether it's from Newstart or others, should be spent on grog? Is that what you're saying? We are providing 20 per cent in cash. People can do whatever they like with it, but they cannot spend all of their money down at the grog shop, down at the pub, down at the bottle-o, or use it for the purchase of illicit substances or gambling products. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, we see those opposite bringing up the great scare campaign about pensioners. Well, every individual that has raised that in the House should stand up and make an apology, because one of your own—the state member for Keppel, Brittany Lauga—was forced to apologise in the Queensland Legislative Assembly on 24 February 2022 for misleading that house on claims she made on 30 November 2021 about pensioners being put on the CDC. It was wrong, it was untrue and it was used as a scare campaign. Those opposite continue to raise it in this place, and they should make an apology because it is false and misleading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, it is the constituents who live in regional areas who will be impacted. It is those individuals who have strongly supported the rollout because it makes a difference. They know it doesn't fix all ills, they know it doesn't fix all evils, but they know that it makes change, and change is what we are about in this place. It was a change for the positive and should be supported.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  I rise today in proud support of the member for Bruce's statements regarding the cashless debit card for welfare. For the information of those opposite, it really is getting a bit tiresome to hear the division that they continue to peddle about cities versus regions. I represent the biggest regional electorate in Tasmania and one of the bigger ones in the country, and I tell you what: the people in my electorate did not want this card being rolled out across Lyons and across Tasmania. So this is not about this false distinction between inner-city elites and regional electorates. Regional people did not want this card rolled out into their communities either. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hinkler just said he got big support for this card in his electorate. I don't know what questions he asked, but people find it easy to say, 'Yes, I want that card rolled out for other people.' But what happens if it's for them? This is why those opposite are so big now in saying that age pensioners were never in their plans. The fact is that the legislation that they had in place before the last election would have made it possible for age pensioners to be put on this card. Their own minister, Anne Ruston, said she wanted this to be a universal platform for welfare payments. All the evidence lined up. They wanted this rolled out as part of a national rollout. That's what the truth is. They ran scared when we told the truth: that their long-term plans were to get pensioners onto this. That's when they ran scared, because they knew that old-age pensioners don't want to be put on this card.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If it's such a wonderful, fantastic card, as members of the coalition have lined up to tell us—including the member for Riverina, the member for Hinkler and, I'm sure, the member for Grey—why don't they want old-age pensioners on it? I'll tell you why they are saying pensioners are not part of their plans: because they're worried about the politics, because they know that it's easy for people to say, 'Yes, I want that card to be for other people, for people in remote communities, for people of a certain colour—I want them on it—but I don't want to be on it.' What the Labor Party says is, 'Nobody should be on this card who doesn't want to be on it.' I spoke last year about this awful card, its impact on thousands of Australians and its potential impact on people in my electorate if the former government's ambitions for the national rollout were realised. I've been a fierce advocate for scrapping it, and I'm very pleased doing so is one of the first acts of this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't list everything wrong with this card in the allocated five minutes, but I'll just speak for the next couple on one thing, and that's the coalition's ideological obsession with the privatisation of Australian social security. Good government improves lives—that's a simple fact. We have more than a century of evidence to back this up. Health, education, housing, prosperity—nearly every advance in the lives of everyday Australians has been the result of deliberate government policy and intervention where required. Those opposite, the political equivalent of the flat earth society, ignore the evidence and always stick to their ideological opposition. They believe the private market is better at everything, and they refuse to allow facts to get in the way of that stubborn belief. The cashless debit card was privatised welfare, in practice, and the coalition wanted it rolled out as a universal platform for all welfare payments. If they'd been returned to office, the card would not have been scrapped; it would have been expanded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian National Audit Office reported there was a lack of evidence about the card's effectiveness, despite the fact those opposite signed a multimillion-dollar contract with a private company to run it. That's $1,200 per participant, at least—ching-ching!—easy money, straight from the taxpayer into the pockets of company directors. That's money that could have been spent on health services, mental health services, addiction clinics, housing, education and training, or employment assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 16,000 Australians were on this card when Labor scrapped it. That's 16,000 Australians having to answer to a private company and having to beg for access to payments for items like specialised brassieres. A woman was told she couldn't have a brassiere that she needed; she had to phone up. It's humiliating. She was told to provide photographic evidence for her need—outrageous. You don't treat human beings like that. And that 16,000 would have grown to millions if the Liberals had been re-elected to government, with hundreds of millions of dollars more in fees. I'm pleased this card is gone. May it rot in hell.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr RAMSEY:</span>
                  </a>  I've heard the member for Bruce speak about this many times in the House, and for his information: there are age pensioners on the cashless debit card. Do you know how they can get there? They have to request it. If they don't like it, do you know how they get off it? They have to request it. That's why age pensioners are on the cashless debit card: because they want to be there, because it protects them against the humbug, the bullying and the violence that accompanies many of these families when there is a drug addict or an alcoholic in the family. So they seek that protection, as do many other people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community of Ceduna led Australia in the cashless debit card trial. And I make the point that the 80-20 split was suggested by the Far West Aboriginal Communities Leaders Group. The Far West Aboriginal Communities Leaders Group was instrumental in the rollout of the card in Ceduna. The current Minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, has been to Ceduna three times and refused to meet with the council or the Far West Aboriginal Communities Leaders Group because they didn't agree with her point of view. They didn't agree with the view of the Indigenous affairs minister that the card should be rolled up. They actually want the card to keep going. The people of Ceduna have once again voted with a strong majority to return me to the position of member for Grey; 62 per cent of them voted for Rowan Ramsey. They know my position on this. I think that's a pretty fair marker on their opinion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth remembering that the introduction of this card came about as part of the response to the South Australian Coroner's report delivered by Anthony Schapel in 2011. Six Indigenous people, as it turned out, had died in recent times, in the five years leading up to that in Ceduna. By the time he finished his inquiry, it was seven—all alcohol related deaths. He said, when he'd been to Ceduna, 'It's a bleak picture of local alcohol abuse, chronic sickness and self-neglect.' A cashless debit card is by no means a silver bullet, and we've had issues since. But I can tell you that Ceduna is not the place it was in 2011. It is vastly improved and—touch wood—as far as I know we have not had a similar death in the decade since. That's really quite stunning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know what the future will bring, but there's a part of me that says there will be deaths as a result of the rolling up of this cashless debit card. I think, and so do many of the people of Ceduna, that we are heading back to the bad old days. There were a couple of occasions in the last two or three years when a stream of cash came through to the other half of the cashless debit card—to their normal account, if you like, where the 20 per cent goes. One of them was around a superannuation issue, working for the CDP, and it was cashed out. And there was another one, and I just can't remember what it was, but it resulted in cash in pocket, and we ended up with a flood of people from remote areas coming into Ceduna, maybe in the first instance to access medical services, but not going home because they got on the grog, they got on the drugs, they got on the gambling machines and they would not go home. And we've got an issue at the moment with the CDP, which is no longer requiring presentation for work, which is adding to that difficulty. But, certainly, rolling up the card can only force Ceduna to go backwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I often visit Ceduna. On a recent visit, I dropped in to a number of businesses. I dropped in to one of the schools; there are two there. We were talking to three administration workers. They all told me they were fearful of what Ceduna would become with the abolition of the cashless debit card. Certainly, they are not looking for the removal of it. There are people in Ceduna that want to see it removed—of course there are; there is always a contrary opinion. But I thought we came to this place because we believed in democracy and that the majority should have their view. I have absolutely no doubt that the majority of people in Ceduna want the cashless debit card to continue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  Many constituents of Kooyong have contacted my office to convey their distress regarding the National Disability Insurance Scheme. One example is that of Fraser Hill, a 12-year-old boy from Kooyong affected by autism, ADHD and anxiety. He's violent, and he self-harms. Until recently, his parents could access only six hours of support a week. Many families describe difficulty regarding lack of transparency around criteria for funding, inexperience of case workers and the very significant documentation required for NDIS applications. And adults, such as Louisa Di Pietro, a 52-year-old woman with a lifelong genetic condition and multiple comorbidities related to that disorder and its treatment, report frustration with the lack of understanding of their medical conditions, the need for repeated assessment of lifelong and often progressive disability and the appeals process. These issues are worse for those with limited English and those who struggle to deal with the complexities of our public service system.</span>

He cited that there are fewer people going to university to study teaching. In fact, there's been a 16 per cent decrease in the past 10 years. That's why this government's committed to $40,000 bursaries and expanding the High Achieving Teachers Program to encourage the best and brightest to become teachers, and it's why we're prioritising visas for overseas teachers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, from this old chalkie and this old principal, can I just say: teaching is an incredible career—a career for those with a high IQ, because the intellectual demands are great; for those with high emotional intelligence, because the emotional demands are great; and for those with strong communication skills, because the communication demands are great. But for all that, it is an incredibly, incredibly encouraging career. It's an incredible career, where teamwork is imperative, and it creates a wonderful collegiate culture. It's a job where the interactions with students give you real-time feedback on your work every minute of your day, a job where the fruits of your labour are young Australians and their families, and the celebrations are inspiring.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  I was honoured to attend the opening of the Beaumaris Landmark Mural on the Beaumaris Concourse. The mural is one of several around Goldstein painted by the ultra-talented Daiana Ingleton, a young artist who lives in Highett and received amazing support from her art teacher at Sandringham Secondary College when she was urged to enter a mural competition at Black Rock. Daiana's work now adorns walls around our community, not only beautifying our area but also deterring vandals from graffitiing empty walls.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular mural depicts aspects of Beaumaris and the foreshore around Ricketts Point, an area world-renowned for fossils, particularly the teeth of extinct sharks. Local marine and bird life, including the weedy sea dragon, pelican and black swan, form part of the enormous mural, which is on the wall of the post office. A shell midden reflects the area's Indigenous history, along with two flowers, the yellow daisy and the kangaroo crabapple, which is said to have been worn in the hair of the Bunurong women. The late Clarice Beckett, renowned local artist, is also present in the mural, with her paints and brushes. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Neighbourhood Watch Beaumaris and Black Rock for your tireless voluntary work making this project happen, the local council and the Beaumaris Concourse Traders Association. Particular congratulations to artist Daiana Ingleton—you'll find her on Instagram—who spent many days on a cherry picker in the cold creating this stunning piece of art to adorn our neighbourhood and remind us of our heritage. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  With the rising cost of housing, rents are rising and so too is homelessness. It's a serious social issue in my electorate and elsewhere throughout Australia that must be addressed. I therefore look forward to the implementation of the Albanese Labor government's housing plan to provide 30,000 social and affordable houses. Yesterday, the South Australian Malinauskas Labor government announced that contracts have been signed to build 400 new public houses, with 200 to be built in the Greater Adelaide area, 150 in regional South Australia and 50 specifically for people experiencing homelessness. My view is that building more public housing is the most effective way of responding to the growing housing crisis.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  More and more, everyday people are finding themselves struggling at the moment. Inflation is at a 20-year high. Wages are still stagnant and falling in real terms. One of the biggest strains on households is the cost of filling up the car with petrol. Public transport is, sadly, still too expensive, and usage is still hovering around two-thirds to three-quarters of pre-pandemic levels. Millions of people are instead stuck in traffic every day, and this is further fuelling the climate crisis. There's a very easy solution. Governments around the world are taking action. The German government has slashed fares for regional train travel by 90 per cent. In New Zealand, the government has implemented an emergency halving of public transport fares, which has now been extended until January next year. This has boosted public transport usage by over 30 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time Australia follows suit. Public transport should urgently be made cheap or even free. This will help everyday people who are struggling with the cost of transport, it'll get people out of traffic, and it'll reduce emissions. It's a no-brainer. If Germany can afford it and if New Zealand can afford it, Australia can afford it. And, if the government needs a place to look for how we'll fund it, I'd suggest the $204 billion wasted on tax cuts for the megarich would be a good place to start. So let's get cars off the road and more money back in people's pockets so they can afford the things that make life worth living—which sure as heck isn't being stuck in traffic!</span>

It's already happening in Bentley, in my home electorate of Swan. On 11 July, the cathode precursor pilot plant opened at Curtin University. This facility will help design and build battery-manufacturing facilities on a commercial and industrial scale. It will also help the talents of our next generation of chemical and process engineers to ensure that we have the capacity to develop our battery-manufacturing industry. This development is possible because of a collaboration between industry, researchers, and the state and federal governments. But more work needs to be done to develop the confidence of our battery manufacturers and researchers. </span>

I know that, if we can develop our nation's manufacturing capabilities, it will mean stable jobs, high-paying jobs, and good jobs, particularly for the residents of Swan. </span>

Twenty-odd years ago, when I first started at the Caboolture Football Club, she and Moorsy, as we affectionately knew her, would serve us drinks after the game, and they always had a friendly word. Her commitment was second to none. She was rewarded by being given a life membership of the Caboolture Football Club, and she was also instrumental in the startup of the Caboolture Sports Club, which is the biggest club in Queensland, 22 years ago. She volunteered there for that entire time. She'll also be remembered for her tremendous work in her foster kids Christmas drive. I remember that, when I first got in, she was the first on the phone to say, 'Terry, you need to put your hand in your pocket to make sure that these kids have got presents on Christmas Day,' which I was more than happy to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I recently met with a group of seniors in my electorate who have arrived in Australia from India under the contributory parent visa program. Some of the most pressing challenges they raised with me were issues of social isolation, the lack of community support networks and the pressure of adjusting to a new environment and creating a new place to call home. Although they are incredibly happy to be here and to join their families in Australia, many, unfortunately, are struggling in a way which impacts their families who are already here. Some of the difficulties are around access to and affordability of public transport, access to social activities and interactions with the broader community.</span>

In doing so, I commend the work of Nayana Bhandari and the Oorja Foundation, who are dedicating their time to these aged parents from India to help them feel a little bit more at home and to help them connect with many other people in their community. For my part, I look forward to continuing our conversation with this group of seniors in my electorate and to working with other members of the Indian community not only to put forward and raise their issues of concern but also to find solutions for their problems.</span>

Unfortunately, at the Gold Coast, he had a bad accident in a collision with a car door, which I'm sure is something any cyclists in the room are always aware of. But what a great kid to actually turn out! He's an adult now, obviously. But what a great example for all those kids who are at Kawungan State School, Xavier and all the other colleges right across Australia of what you can do when you dedicate time to an event like this. The triathlon is a tough event, but I think the fact that we've got a local from Hervey Bay taking out the first medal for Australia at the Commonwealth Games is fantastic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Syd Dart is Matty Hauser's grandfather. He is a regular caller and shopper at my office. I think Syd at Burrum Heads will be very pleased. He will be absolutely chuffed, and I'm sure we'll get a call from him tomorrow. Best of luck to Matt for his career into the future. Congratulations to another local. Well done on the world stage, and go Australia at the Commonwealth Games!</span>

I'd like to especially acknowledge the work of BANSIC, who do amazing work to support people in the local community, including through their much-loved op shop at the Macleod shops. BANSIC also do great work through their food hub in West Heidelberg, which is providing food assistance to people in need in my community and in surrounding communities. If there is someone who needs food relief, the hub is there with frozen food, ready-made meals or fresh produce from our local groups like SecondBite and the Macleod Organic Community Garden. I know they pay particular attention to trying to get people food that they need and that is culturally appropriate. I commend them for that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend all the BANSIC volunteers who turn up there every week to make sure that people are getting the food relief they need. Kate Farrelly leads the team there. It was great to be able to visit them the other week because, while they really stepped up through COVID and thought that that was their busy time, they continue to be busy as prices are rising and people in our community continue to be in need. So thank you to BANSIC.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  I rise to acknowledge one of my constituents, Merewyn Wright, who recently lost her husband, Stan. Merewyn and Stan have been tireless advocates for the Airlie Beach community through their involvement in community organisations like Rotary. They've also been long-time supporters of the Liberal National Party in Queensland. Merewyn and Stan met while Merewyn was working as a deputy principal in Nanango in South Burnett. They married and eventually moved to Airlie Beach, where Merewyn taught until her retirement in 2014. Stan was a keen pilot and active member of the Whitsunday Aero Club. He obtained a general aviation pilot licence back in the early sixties and had a real passion for flying. Stan was a very strong supporter of Merewyn and her work in the community through her involvement in Rotary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of recognising Merewyn as the Whitsunday Regional Council citizen of the year during the Australia Day awards in 2019 while I was mayor. Merewyn has been deeply involved in community events like the Rotary boat show and Carols by the Beach, with Stan always by her side. One of Rotary's biggest community efforts was in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Debbie, which was the second-largest cyclone to make landfall in Australia. The organisation helped locals who had lost everything, and worked tirelessly to build our community. Stan was Merewyn's friend, husband and staunchest supporter. His contribution to his community will be sorely missed by all. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  My father's grandparents lived in a place called Dagworth. Now it's called Testers Hollow. They had a little wooden boat and, when the rains came, they would have to row the boat because there was no road—they were isolated. Let's roll forward over 100 years. The people of Gillieston Heights in my electorate still need a boat to get out of Gillieston Heights, except now there are 3½ thousand people who live in this mushrooming suburb of the Paterson electorate. Thousands of people have moved from Newcastle and Western Sydney to live in beautiful Gillieston Heights. The problem is the New South Wales government keeps letting them down.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016 I ran on a campaign of raising Testers Hollow. We put forward $15 million. The New South Wales state government could find only $2 million to do the job. I say to that government: stump up some more money and do Testers Hollow properly so that we don't have a once-in-25-years flood-proof level for the road but a once-in-50-years or once-in-100-years level. It needs to be fixed. I say to the New South Wales state government: come on, fix Testers Hollow. In this day and age, we can't have the New South Wales SES having to run food, nappies and water to people who are completely cut off on Gillieston Island, as it became known. It's not good enough.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Established in May 2014, the objective of this social enterprise initiative, which is run by Project Youth, is to empower young people by providing them with access to education, training and employment. Project Youth also works to house approximately 70 of the shire's homeless youth every night. The education and training allows our youth to develop their own future and to thrive. Over the course of the last three years, Cafe Y has supported over 180 young people by providing them with the opportunity to do work placement and gain experience in the hospitality industry. This has lifted them out of homelessness, family hardship, mental health issues and substance abuse. This initiative gives these youth a chance to learn expectations within the workplace and obtain the knowledge and skills required to take them into future employment.</span>

She was able to complete her HSC and went on to work at Shangri-La Sydney for a period of time. Tash is now running the Cafe Y front of house and supporting other young people who are doing their own work placement.</span>

On 1 July I was pleased to attend the blessing and opening of the Saint Francis Catholic College buildings which house the multipurpose hall and the technology, science, creative and performing arts, and general learning classrooms. These growing suburbs and the students living there deserve infrastructure to support their education. I applaud the foresight of the Wollongong dioceses for their planning, with the decision made in 2015 to build a school at Edmondson Park.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important that the New South Wales government catches up and provides a high school to offer students living in Edmondson Park an education close to home, especially for those who are currently travelling long distances to overcrowded schools. New suburbs deserve facilities to be available as soon as people move in. Saint Francis Catholic College started on a temporary site in 2017 with 178 kinder to year 7 students and 32 teachers and support staff. The school now boasts a student population of 1,250 and over 125 staff. The opening was performed by the Most Reverend Brian Mascord, bishop of the Wollongong dioceses, with an address by the current and founding principal, Mr Simon Abernethy. I was so impressed by the facilities and would like to thank them for their hospitality.</span>

It was a privilege to meet Connie and hear more about her story. Connie was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on 3 July 1922. At the time, George V was king and South Africa was experiencing the turbulent Rand Rebellion. Connie enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in February 1942, at just 20 years old, rising to the rank of corporal before her discharge, in January 1946.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were proud to present her with an RSL Victoria certificate and flowers from the committee and members of the Lilydale RSL. Connie is the last member of the Lilydale RSL who served during World War II. The day was also a reminder of the important role RSLs play in supporting returned service men and women. For over 100 years the RSL has provided support network services and a place for comradery and recognition for current and ex serving members. RSL Australia today supports public debate, education and increased public awareness of issues relating to veterans affairs. I am proud to be a member of the Lilydale RSL, and I am committed to working with the RSLs of Casey to support them as they support our veterans. Happy birthday, Connie.</span>

Allicia competed in the Asia and Oceania 24-hour running championships in Bangaluru, India—it's not all Birmingham! An ultramarathon event in an incredible temperature of 29 degrees and a whopping 90 per cent humidity, Allicia ran 211.8 kilometres. For those wondering: run to Goulburn via Braidwood and then head back to Parliament House, and then head up Mount Ainslie just to finish off, all while squeezing a sponge with ice-cold water over your head because it's so hot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lap after lap, Allicia was in the zone with the electric atmosphere in the stadium keeping her going. In these incredibly tough conditions, she didn't hit the wall until two hours to go, but she pushed through and won an individual bronze and Australian team gold. A simply awesome effort. I asked Allicia to share some of her thoughts on representing Australia, and she said: 'The feeling of representing your country is like no other. All those training and prior hours lead to this. I had to pinch myself a few times. But to be able to experience it with my newfound teammates was simply incredible. We were there for a purpose, and I was going to give it my all for 24 hours.' That she did. Thank you and congratulations.</span>

Yet when I saw the determination of the YLNP to fight for the core values and beliefs of our party, it was truly inspirational.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  St Paul's Anglican Church is a beautiful sandstone church in Burwood. Go there on any given day, at any given hour, and it will be a hive of activity. That is because of the incredible work of Father James Collins and his team of committed volunteers. The main buzz of activity comes from the parish pantry, started in 2012. It's been a constant source of much-needed food and essential items for locals doing it tough. What is extraordinary about the pantry is that it remained open throughout the pandemic to make sure that people were able to get the help that they needed. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a determination and steely will to Father James that belies his soft-spoken and gentle demeanour. His form of pastoral care is accepting, embracing and yet unobtrusive. There is no expectation to worship or even to enter the church. Father James and his team of volunteers, led by the wonderful Rosemary King, include Jane and Tara Cordina, Kerin Brown, Eugene Tomzcyk, Margaret Whittaker, Petrina Traill and Mark Taylor. They have defied the odds by providing all this assistance on a shoestring budget. But in the last 2½ years of the pandemic, they've seen an unprecedented spike in demand. Where they previously provided a few hundred meals a week, they are now providing 4,000 meals a week. I thank them for their tireless work helping out the most vulnerable in the community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I rise to give what will be the final update—I promise the chamber—on the Max Amber Reserve project, which I've been speaking about for the last three years, since I was first elected; I made a commitment in the 2019 campaign towards that facility. Happily, a week or 10 days before election day this year, I was able to attend the ribbon-cutting at that facility, and, a few weeks ago, I attended the first home game of the Athelstone Football Club—the Raggies—at the new sports clubrooms at Max Amber Reserve. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a fantastic facility. We committed $5 million towards it, and the local Campbelltown Council met that dollar for dollar, so it ended up being a project of a little over $10 million, to rebuild the clubrooms there. It's a great outcome for all the local sporting clubs. Football, cricket, a new netball club, and soccer and tennis as well—they've all received a benefit from this project. It's been absolutely transformational, particularly for female participation in the clubs there. They now have the sort of facilities they deserve, to be able to compete with dignity. I'm so thrilled that, in my first term, we were able to make that commitment, deliver the funding, see the project through to completion and, just a week before the election, open that facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all the partners, particularly Romaldi Constructions, who undertook the build, and everyone at the Campbelltown Council. As usual, they were great partners to work with, and I'm really pleased that, together, we delivered this for our local community.</span>

The festival was on Yolngu land, and I commend the elders and organisers for this fantastic event. A particular thankyou must go out to Denise Bowden for her tireless work to make sure that everyone enjoyed the festival but also that COVID safety was implemented. To sit in the crowd as the Prime Minister delivered a thoughtful, heartfelt and respectful speech was one of those moments I won't forget. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long, our politics in Australia has lacked vision. It's lacked determination. It's lacked respect. The decision of this government to implement the Uluru statement marks an end to that. It shows the commitment we have to raise the voices of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, to show our desire to bring people together and to change the lives of Australians for the better. This is a historic moment, and we, as parliamentarians, have a responsibility and an obligation to do the right thing—an obligation to bring our community together to lead this great country to a better future and an obligation to our First Peoples to enshrine their voices in the Constitution. </span>

Last week I attended a briefing from the minister. I learned something from that briefing: if we get an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Australia—just one outbreak—our exports will cease, which is 70 per cent of our production, and it's likely to take two to three years to get that export status back. If it were to get into our feral populations of goats, pigs, camels, deer and buffalo, I don't think we'd ever get our export status back. This is a chronic danger.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the government has now brought in the mats with citric acid. I hope they are as effective as the footbaths. I made the point last week in a speech that, if you are coming back from anywhere that has a foot-and-mouth infection, you should expect to have your luggage opened completely, as if you were making a declaration. If there's footwear in your luggage, it should go in the bath and be given back to you in a plastic bag. Most especially, we need to stop meat imports from any one of those areas. We saw the McDonald's hamburgers coming into Adelaide, or trying to come into Adelaide. But let me say the New Zealand government has banned meat imports from any country in the world that has foot-and-mouth disease. And we should do the same. </span>

Two and a half years later, the community finally has its much-loved clubhouse back. I was incredibly disappointed to miss the opening of the club last Thursday, because I was here in parliament, but my heart was truly with the Malua Bay community. I regularly checked in on the bowling club, even throwing a few bowls on a few occasion. Club Malua did a remarkable job staying open in their pretty impressive marquee all this time. </span>

I would like to congratulate the local community. The club has been a unifying place for everyone impacted by the bushfires in this community, and it is really terrific to see it open once more. I can't wait to get back to Club Malua and share a bowl with you again. I've even got my very own Club Malua shirt at home, just itching to get out on the green. I can't wait! </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I rise today to wish a big happy birthday to Robert 'Uncle Bob' Anderson, a proud Ngugi elder from Mulgumpin in Quandamooka country, now residing in my electorate of Moreton. He celebrated his 93rd birthday yesterday. Ninety-three years ago, Uncle Bob was born on Overend Street, East Brisbane. His father worked on ship repairs and suffered a serious industrial workplace accident, and in later years he was committed to an institution. This was years before the days of social security, and Uncle Bob's mother worked two jobs to keep the family of six together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Bob is a veteran trade unionist. He has spent a lifetime in the labour movement and was the first Indigenous Australian to work as the state organiser for the Building Workers Industrial Union, later the CFMEU. Uncle Bob joined the East Brisbane branch of the Labor Party in 1950. He has also served in various First Nations organisations, working in the fields of reconciliation, native title, social justice, youth welfare and cultural identity, always seeking out injustice and inequality and demanding justice for and supporting those who could not speak for themselves. Ninety seconds is not long enough to outline what Uncle Bob has achieved and continues to achieve. Read the book. Just recently he was named Brisbane NAIDOC Elder of the Year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just enough time to say that Uncle Bob is a great man who continues to inspire and continues to live out his values. I was lucky enough to meet with Uncle Bob, and I should point out that, whilst he normally campaigns for me, he wasn't able to in the 2022 election. But I did get a good result for you, Uncle Bob.</span>

As I'm no longer Speaker, I once again get the opportunity to talk in the Federation Chamber and also the House. It's been an unbelievable privilege for me to have won the election. The people of Fisher have put their faith in me once again. It is a tremendous privilege—one that I never, ever will take for granted. I'm going to continue to fight for the people of Fisher. I'm going to fight for better roads and rail. I'm going to fight for better mental health services. I'm going to fight for small businesses and local manufacturers. I'm going to fight for Australians and their interests at home and abroad. And I want to protect the special character of our community on the Sunshine Coast. It's about attracting funding for infrastructure, roads and rail—our Sunshine Coast rail, for which we tried desperately hard to get support and which the new government committed to funding just prior to the election. So I look forward to seeing that remain in the budget in October.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  One of the greatest ever sportspeople died overnight: the incomparable basketball player Bill Russell. Bill Russell's talent, character and commitment to the game were remarkable and relentless, and the team success that followed was simply astounding. Under his leadership, the Boston Celtics won eight championships in a row, from 1959 to 1966. Indeed, they won 11 times in 13 years, and Russell's record in deciding game 7s was 10-0. In the last two of those winning campaigns he played as captain and coach, the first African American to coach a major sport league franchise.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell was not a flashy player. He was not a great scorer. He didn't care for statistics or celebrity. His extraordinary strengths were all the unfashionable building blocks of the game: playing defence, taking rebounds, making the right pass and making the players on his team better. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell was consistently outspoken about racism and injustice in the United States, and in 2011 President Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I fell in love with basketball when I was young, and at some point a family friend gave me a book chapter about Bill Russell. With no justification whatsoever, I chose to be No. 6 when I played. There has never been any part of my game or life that resemble Bill Russell's talent, courage and class. But I did want to play and live by his example. Vale Bill Russell.</span>

But today I rise to give a shout-out to the Cashless Debit Card Regional Jobs Hub coordinator, Jess Kail, and her team. Together they've been working hard supporting the Goldfields CDC participants to transition from welfare into job-readiness training and ultimately local employment. This federally funded jobs hub was designed by local government authorities to address the chronic Goldfields worker shortages and to create meaningful employment pathways for CDC participants. I give great credit to the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder and the shires of Leonora, Laverton, Coolgardie and Menzies for their steadfast support for this program,</span>

Together this team has been helping CDC participants to achieve their aspirations for employment. Last month I joined them at one of their regular barbecues in Kalgoorlie, where participants were informally engaging with support services and training opportunities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  I rise to speak about the arts sector. COVID has been an incredibly challenging time for the arts sector, and this was compounded by the Morrison government abandoning the sector and excluding many workers in the arts sector from the JobKeeper wage subsidy—not to mention the systemic funding cuts to the arts delivered by coalition governments before the pandemic. So I'm very proud that the Albanese Labor government has already begun to fix this damage and that we now have in Tony Burke an arts minister who is genuinely passionate about the arts and the importance of this sector to all aspects of Australian life. Our arts minister is already consulting on our national cultural policy, which will establish a comprehensive road map to guide the skills and resources required in order to transform and safeguard a diverse, vibrant and sustainable arts, entertainment and cultural sector now and into the future. I'm very pleased that he will be holding a town hall in my electorate next Monday to consult with the Canberra arts sector, and I encourage all Canberra artists and creatives and those who are interested to please make a submission and have their say.</span>

I also want to congratulate the ACT government for their leadership in the arts, including the recent $28 million commitment to revitalise Civic Square and the Canberra Theatre Centre.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  On 7 September this House will host a delegation travelling from Queensland, particularly from the south-east corner, and it is the Council of Mayors. The Council of Mayors is made up of seven shires from the south-east corner from the Gold Coast and North Coast and out as far as the Lockyer Valley in Somerset, of which my electorate takes up 7½ thousand kilometres. They do amazing work up there advocating with the federal government to raise capital, in particular with the Olympic Games in 2032 being hosted in Brisbane. They will work constructively with both sides of government, and I acknowledge the work they have done with us and the many millions of dollars that our government has forwarded to the Council of Mayors for programs in their electorates. We will continue to encourage them to develop South-East Queensland until it becomes one of the growth corridors of this nation.</span>

My electorate sits completely within those three shires, and I just could not have won the last election without their support. A shout-out to them and their supporters for the work they do in getting me re-elected. I acknowledge the amazing work that they do in their communities.</span>

At the same time, Ipswich is one of the fastest-growing regions in the country, so we need the jobs and infrastructure to sustain that sort of growth. And there are employment opportunities—in biotech, defence industries, meat processing and manufacturing. But we need people to come together; we need people to generate ideas and get them into the jobs forum here in Canberra in September. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foot-and-mouth disease has not been in our country for 130 years. The Labor government needs to take stronger action to reduce the very real threat—potentially the imminent threat—of FMD, which would devastate the $80 billion livestock agricultural industry. I know that the member for Barker is going to have more to say about this as well, but I've moved this motion on behalf of the member for Maranoa—the shadow agriculture minister and the Nationals leader. He, like me, and I'm sure the member for Barker and the member for Wright, has had so many farmers, stock and station agents, abattoir owners and others expressing their fears about what foot-and-mouth disease would do to Australia if it arrived in this country. I'm desperately concerned that traces have already been detected in both Melbourne and Adelaide. This is a significant threat that I can't underplay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Riverina and Central West farmers have asked me to implore the government to stop all travel to and from Bali. Now, I know that is a drastic measure—that's not what I'm requesting here—but it has been asked by farmers. This motion calls on the government to immediately confirm the current biosecurity risk level, and at what point—predicated on scientific data, and science is extremely important in this regard; it's been stated by the member for Maranoa—the international border with Indonesia would need to be temporarily closed in order to protect Australia from the threat of foot-and-mouth disease. I believe the government has a responsibility to seriously consider every option on the table. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate that the minister for agriculture, Senator Murray Watt, has had a briefing. It was one of the best-attended meetings I've ever seen in this place. It was held in the theatrette last week. The number in attendance just confirmed the nature and the seriousness that we certainly hold on this side, and I'm sure others opposite do too. Whilst I appreciate that drastic steps may need to be taken, nothing should be off the table when it comes to protecting not just the agricultural industry but, indeed, our nation. I cannot believe that somebody who once occupied a seat in this place and is now a minister in the West Australian parliament, Alannah MacTiernan, suggested that beef and dairy prices might be reduced if foot-and-mouth disease took hold in Australia. That is just—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion also calls on the government to immediately offer a 3D X-ray screening program with Indonesia so that organic and plant matter in luggage can be effectively identified. Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, I was with you overseas last week, and we know that we take more than one pair of shoes when we go overseas. The difficulty is: what happens if microbes and matter are on a pair of shoes that is inside your briefcase? It's not picked up by the sniffer dogs, who do a great job, and not picked up by border security, who do a great job. The government should provide every bit of assistance it can, both financially and on the ground, with our agricultural experts and biosecurity teams, to help overcome this FMD problem, which has now spread to 22 of 37 Indonesian provinces—22 out of 37—particularly in Bali in Indonesia, where thousands of head of livestock have already been killed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Labor, when there was a television program back in 2011, stopped live exports just like that—like that—blaming perceived cruelty. Yes, some of the scenes shown on that <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program were very unsightly, but the government stopped the live trade exports on a whim, because of perceived cruelty. This disease is crueller than anything shown on that program. Not taking stronger action is too risky for our agricultural and livestock industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact I've just got off the phone from three of my local abattoir owners: Will Barton from Gundagai, Heath Newton from Junee and Chris Cummins from Cowra. All operate highly successful sheep-processing plants. All employ hundreds upon hundreds of regional people. Will Barton was very circumspect. He spoke about the need to be vigilant. He spoke about the need to make sure that we put in place every measure that's needed now and certainly don't hold back on anything that might be needed. They are processing 4,000 sheep a day. They're back doing that. Labour shortages are one of the most critical areas in Gundagai. But Will has actually had word from the government, and I commend the government for that. I called out to the government after the election to assist in any way they could, and Will was happy with the response.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris Cummins at Cowra—again, they employ hundreds of people—is terrified. That was the word he used, not mine; I'm not over-egging it. He said anybody who is involved in this industry who is not terrified does not have their head screwed on properly and that if we get the disease in we'll never get it out. That's how foot-and-mouth disease is. He said he was very, very concerned about border controls, border biosecurity, and he wants everything put in place to make sure it doesn't happen. He mentioned the feral pig population, and I know the member for Wright has spoken about that as well. If it gets in the feral pig population in Papua New Guinea, it's all over. It is simply is all over. So we need to do everything we can, not just at our borders but to help Indonesia as well.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Heath Newton—Junee Prime Lamb: if you're having a roast, a side of lamb or a cutlet here in Canberra, chances are it'll be from Junee. He employs many hundreds of people—380, in fact. He's killing 5,000 sheep a day. He is very, very concerned about our export markets. As he said: 'Our whole export market is gone completely. We might as well shut it down if FMD gets into Australia.' He's not exaggerating, either. These people are practical, sensible people. These people are not fearmongers. These people are businesspeople. They are very worried about our ag industry. They're very worried about the people they employ. They're very worried about their regional communities. But they're also very worried about our nation. As Heath says, 'Where are the protocols?' We've heard nothing about what we will do, if it in fact does get into our nation, to hopefully eradicate it. If that is the case, well, it might be too far gone. And as he said, he needs assurances that the disease is going to be kept out of our country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris Cummins is looking to expand and spend millions upon millions of dollars in providing the US export markets with his Breakout River Meats from Cowra. He has put the brakes on that because of this outbreak, because of this concern in Indonesia. So already it's stifling investment. Already it's terrifying the daylights out of people like Chris Cummins, who is one of the straightest shooters I have ever met.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After FMD was detected in Bali on 5 July, as the member for Maranoa pointed out, it took more than three weeks of indecision and delay for the government to introduce disinfectant footbaths at Australian international airports. That is a concern. I appreciate that that has been done now. We were assured of that at the briefing that Minister Watt provided to us last week, and we were appreciative of that. We are appreciative of whatever briefings can be done between the department and the opposition or between the minister and the opposition, and certainly whatever message the government can convey to allay any fears for the people we represent in regional Australia will be very much welcomed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come to this in a bipartisan way. I know the member for Maranoa does as well. He has asked me to move this motion. He is in shadow cabinet, but he is very concerned as somebody who has a very large electorate in Queensland. It doesn't matter whether you're in Queensland or what state you're in. It doesn't even matter if you represent a city electorate. This is of great concern to all Australians. Whilst I appreciate that the fear might be more widespread in regional areas where we understand the mechanics and the nuances of country living, this should be of concern to every Australian who's ever ventured into a supermarket, gone into the meat section and decided to buy a lamb roast or a side of beef or whatever the case might be.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion calls on the government to, as I say, immediately offer a 3D X-ray screening program with Indonesia and immediately enforce a ban—importantly—on all passengers from Indonesia bringing in any food products. We saw today that person bringing in a McDonald's burger. Seriously, these people are just trashing our reputation and placing at risk our biosecurity and our agricultural industry. I applaud this motion and I commend it to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  I'd like to note, first off, that, thankfully, there is currently no evidence that foot-and-mouth disease exists in Australia, and we certainly hope that that remains the case. The risk of it entering has been classed by experts as being about 11 per cent over the next five years, but we know that, if people continue to flout the very strong recommendations, guidance and directions that have been given, that risk could increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that, if we are not very vigilant, this disease has the potential to ravage our nation's agriculture sector. As the previous speaker said, you don't need to live in a rural location to know how devastating this may be. In a worst-case scenario, it's estimated that, if FMD were to get into the country, it could cost us as much as $80 billion over several years. Our beef and livestock industries could be devastated. Our wool and dairy industries could also suffer greatly. Countless jobs would be at risk. Everyday food items would become much more expensive. Indeed, already confidence in the market has been rattled, and we hope that our quick response will encourage confidence for markets to return.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't stress enough that this is an issue that we take extremely seriously in the government. We are obviously very happy that so far it has not got into Australia. In fact, it hasn't since 1872. It's been very pleasing to me, coming from the Territory, that the minister, Senator Murray Watt, has taken every phone call and every message from me on this issue. I'm representing our industry—not just Northern Territorian farmers but also farmers from the electorate of the previous speaker, farmers I know from having been in Queensland recently and farmers I know in Tasmania. It doesn't matter that the Tasmanian farmers are on an island off an island that FMD hasn't got to yet. They know how devastating it can be. So I'm obviously very pleased with the fast response of the minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Preceding Minister Watt's visit to Indonesia, I went to Indonesia with the Prime Minister. Biosecurity, and offering that vital support, was one of the main topics that we discussed with the President of Indonesia. Those discussions over there also led to the implementation of a number of protective measures. Back in June, the Commonwealth gave biosecurity a $14 million funding increase. I think that's important because we know that a number of these measures come with a price tag, and we need to be funding those measures. We have added more detector dogs in Darwin International Airport in my electorate and in Cairns Airport, and we have rolled out sanitation foot mats at all international airports. We have been raising awareness for all Australian travellers, particularly those to Indonesia, to be extra vigilant about cleaning their shoes and clothes if they've been anywhere near livestock or in rural areas or markets. I will go further than that and say that everyone travelling to Indonesia, regardless of where they've been, should be doing that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, for my electorate of Solomon this is particularly important, with Darwin being just a short flight away from Denpasar. Territorians, like so many other Australians—particularly those in the west—love to holiday in Indonesia, our near neighbour. So I'm very pleased that we are helping Indonesia, which is dealing with this scourge of FMD, and I'm urging travellers to follow all of the biosecurity advice upon their return home to keep our country safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just about farmers. Anyone who has any idea of the devastation wrought by FMD in Britain knows it's not just the farming communities that suffer; it's whole communities around that. Everything is linked. It is just too awful to imagine. So I do ask those travellers for their patience.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker, it might come as no surprise to you that, as someone who represents one of our premium livestock-producing regions, I've been very vocal about the need for those opposite to do more to mitigate the risk of foot-and-mouth disease entering Australia. The livestock producers in my electorate are on tenterhooks and, quite frankly, rightly so. The Labor government's slow reaction to the threat that remains on our doorstep will be to the detriment of our economy, an $80 billion a year loss. Every single Australian will pay, whether it's at the checkout or with their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard reports that travellers arriving in Australia from Indonesia are not being screened. Even if they have declared themselves to have been on an Indonesian farm, they're just being waved through. The announcements being made on flights aren't good enough. People aren't paying attention. The news of a passenger today attempting to bring a Macca's breakfast meal into the country from Bali should be proof enough that people aren't paying attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional sniffer dogs are welcome, but they actually can't identify FMD. We're not screening 100 per cent of the passengers. We're still not screening all luggage. We still haven't banned the import of meat products. Footbaths are by no means a silver bullet, but they're a fairly simple measure, and that took the government four weeks to implement. There were literally thousands of Australians, and others visiting Australia, who entered our country and were simply waved through without putting their feet on those mats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under a coalition government, we wouldn't have wasted any time in committing to screen all passengers arriving from Indonesia and banning passengers from bringing food into the country—after all, we've got enough. We would have introduced foot mats four weeks ago, and we would have offered the use of 3D X-ray technology to screen passenger luggage on departure in Indonesia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the minister sat back, literally tens of thousands of travellers walked through our airports, straight into our country, unchecked. And if you wonder why my producers are on tenterhooks, quite frankly it's because it only takes one established case. And not only do we need more resources at our borders; we need to do more on the ground in Indonesia. The vaccination effort in Indonesia has been hampered by a lack of supply of vaccines and, indeed, people to administer the vaccines. Australia should be doing more to help the Indonesian vaccine efforts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's FMD failures risk costing the Australian economy $80 billion a year. The livelihood of our livestock producers, transport industries, meatworkers—all of that—is at risk, as is the cost to Australian food producers. For those opposite, let me just bring you into the world of an FMD outbreak. If there is a single confirmed case in this country all livestock for a period of 72 hours will not be able to be moved anywhere. As bad as that sounds, that is nowhere near as bad as it gets. </span>

Let's assume, as the member for O'Connor did, the best-case scenario of a small, contained outbreak somewhere in Australia, where the outbreak hasn't entered our feral herds—that could be feral pigs, feral deer et cetera. How long would you anticipate we would lose our export accreditation for? A couple of weeks?</span>

                  </a>  Several years was the answer. And that is an absolute best-case answer. For producers in my electorate who have geared their farms towards livestock production, who, quite frankly, because of the topography or native vegetation legislation, can't grow or produce anything else, there is literally just over a one-in-10 chance that they'll lose their livelihoods forever. This is like getting a dice and rolling it for a one-in-10 chance. And if that one-in-10 chance comes up—and those opposite are tilting those dice against Australian producers—that's the end of their production systems. It's a risk too great to take and we shouldn't have a minister sleepwalking us into that catastrophe.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  I would just like to say that we do need to take very serious action about foot-and-mouth disease in Australia and we also need to take bipartisan action. We've just heard from the member for Barker and others, and I understand that anyone who is living in rural, regional and agricultural Australia has real fears. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is clear and present danger with foot-and-mouth disease the world over. However, I find it somewhat galling that the opposition are now suddenly full of ideas after nine years of doing very little. There is no plan in place, and it is so frustrating to sit here and have them dish up all of these terrific ideas when, really, some would say they did sweet FA about FMD when they had the chance to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to those opposite is, why did the former government not have a plan? They knew this threat was imminent but they sat on their hands. They did not provide the department with additional resources to plan for or prevent this threat. So please—through you, Mr Deputy Speaker—I implore the members of the now opposition not to come in here with all of their ideas. Where were these ideas for the last nine years? If this is such a critical thing, which we know it is, why weren't they working on it before? In fact, those opposite did not implement a single additional measure to address FMD, even as FMD was spreading across Indonesia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers across Australia are scared for their future, and who could blame them after a decade of neglect by this coalition government? This is why we're staring it down. The gall of a member opposite to stand here and say it took the current government three weeks to roll out citric acid mats at airports, when they had nine years to do something about this. They didn't put a single measure in place. They did not give the department more resources. For 10 years this sector has been served up breadcrumbs, and today they're getting a side of lip service with it from the opposition. Our government will ensure that we seize the opportunities in this sector and make the critical investments needed to protect current and future growth. As a government, we are now doing more for biosecurity with foot-and-mouth disease than has ever been done in Australia's history. We are remaining vigilant. We are doing everything we can. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A moment ago I heard the opposition asking us what we are doing to help Indonesia. This is what we're doing. On top of other measures, we're including one million vaccines to help Indonesia's outbreak, and we have a $14 million biosecurity package to bolster Australia's frontline defence and provide more technical support for countries currently battling FMD and lumpy skin disease. We are working with experts in the field to ensure the most tailored response in preventing the threat from landing on our shores. I implore the opposition: please, please, work with the government on this. I know that rural and regional Australia are terribly worried. Work with us. Don't scaremonger on this important topic—it's not even a topic or an issue; this is really important in terms of our food security. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for immediately increasing surveillance and testing of meat and other animal products, both at our borders and in Indonesia. Quite frankly, the biggest risk for Australia in terms of foot-and-mouth disease is what we've seen the world over—it's packages. Packages coming from Indonesia are the things that pose the biggest risk to us. It's not people visiting farms and then coming back through airports. Whilst that's important, the biggest risk is packages. I implore everyone: please do not order food online from countries that we know have foot-and-mouth disease, particularly, at the moment, Indonesia. It is problematic. We all need to work together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I implore the opposition: please don't scaremonger on this; let's work together. You had nine years to get a plan in place, which we could have implemented overnight. There was no plan. You didn't put enough resources into the department. So don't come in now with all the ideas and all the scaremongering and all the rallying of fear, when Australian agriculture needs your support. It needs resources and it needs everyday Australians to do their bit to ensure, if they do travel to Indonesia and other countries with foot-and-mouth disease, they do not bring it home. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this motion, because communities right across regional and rural Australia are deeply, deeply concerned about the possibility of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and the devastating impact that it would have in communities right across regional and rural Australia. More than anything, I implore the government and I implore the Prime Minister not to play politics with this issue. It is too important to have the government playing politics. So, when you're asked questions about this—and we saw this, sadly, from the Prime Minister in question time—don't go back to misquoting part of a tweet. Actually engage with everyone in the parliament who is asking questions about this, because our communities need those questions answered so they can get the surety that they are looking for. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Wednesday over 120 farmers and people involved in agricultural industry right across the board gathered in Colac in my electorate because they fundamentally wanted questions answered. They want to know how quickly the government is going to move to address this issue. The Prime Minister announced in early June that they were going to be providing vaccines to Indonesia. When will the vaccines arrive? How quickly will they be distributed? When will all food coming from Indonesia be banned? We know the risk is there when it comes through packages, but there is also the risk that it can come through luggage. So why isn't all luggage being screened? Why aren't we addressing that? Why aren't we offering to provide the 3-D screening technology to Indonesia, and why aren't we saying to them, 'We want to work with you to make sure that that's being put in place'?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very simple stuff that would make a world of difference. That would then enable us to say to regional and rural communities that everything is being done to make sure we are being protected from foot-and-mouth disease. The ag industry—the farmers in my communities—are so concerned by this that they have called for a temporary closure of the border while all these measures are put in place. They are so concerned that they want a temporary closure of the border so that they know that these measures are being put in place. To reassure them, we've got to make sure we are talking to them and informing them of what is taking place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members who have spoken previously in this debate have referred to the question that was asked by the member for O'Connor of officials: what would be the impact of foot-and-mouth disease on our ability to trade? Well, it would shut down our ability to trade for 72 hours, but our ability to get back to normal trading, on a best case scenario, would be two years. That is how serious this issue is. And that's why regional and rural Australia in particular is so concerned about it, and that's why this motion is so important. I say to the government: these measures are being put in place. We need to be informed of how quickly they're being put in place, and we're not being informed. We're crying out for that information to be provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the likelihood of the threat of FMD go from nine per cent to 11 per cent. Measures are being put in place. But the most important questions that we need answered are: When can you inform regional and rural Australia that these measures are seeing that risk profile come down? When can we go to them and say that these measures that are being put in place are reducing the risk of an FMD outbreak? We've seen it go from nine per cent to 11 per cent. When will it start trending down? At this stage we have no idea because there is no communication on this fundamental question. Are the measures that are being put in place actually doing anything to lower the risk of an FMD outbreak in Australia? That needs to be answered. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  There can be no doubt whatsoever that foot-and-mouth disease is an extremely serious threat to our farming communities. I come from a dairy farming family. My kids still work on the family dairy farm, so it's not surprise that I take this threat seriously, and so do local farmers on the New South Wales south coast. It takes a lot to really rattle a farmer. They come from strong stock, and they see a lot in their day that makes them as tough as nails. But this disease is serious business. Farmer Tim called it a huge threat to Australian cattle industries. Farmer David raised the really important issue of the mental health impacts on local farmers. His words were, 'The cost will be off the scale.' He asked me to 'ensure that the failed Liberal status quo at immigration points doesn't continue'. Farmer Graham called it an industry-destroying disease. These are just some of the words from so many people contacting me who are concerned about this. And it's not just farmers who are at risk; it's butchers and everyone in that supply chain—and it could have serious implications for our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has the Albanese government done to respond? Well, we have rolled out the biggest biosecurity package that Australia has ever seen to stop this industry-destroying disease. We have worked quickly and we have gone hard. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is leading our response on this issue. The government is working with industry leaders. It is working with the experts to make sure we get the response right. The minister went to Indonesia to ensure collaboration with them and to help them respond. Stemming the spread outside of Australia will be hugely important to keeping our cattle safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our $14 million package is working to do this, sharing expertise and providing technical support with Indonesia, Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea to manage the overseas outbreaks. We've given Indonesia one million vaccines to support this vaccination program. At home, we are focusing our resources on the places of highest risk; additional staff at airports; more biosecurity detector dogs; and additional training for staff. We've rolled out sanitation foot mats at international airports and established biosecurity response zones, the first time that has ever been done under section 365 of the Biosecurity Act 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tightening border security has also seen stronger clearance requirements for all travellers, increased screenings for goods that might pose a risk, and the suspension of import permits for animal products that were of concern. We've tightened the screening of mail as well, with all mail incoming from China and Indonesia now being screened for meat products. Every passenger travelling from Indonesia is getting risk profiled. If they are deemed high risk, they will be subject to additional screenings and more intensive checks. We know that there is high concern about the disease getting into northern Australia in particular, so we are also monitoring cattle and livestock across the north with our biosecurity plan in place so we can react quickly if necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps one of the most important actions we are taking is to have this conversation with all Australians. I know that all Australians want to do the right thing for our farmers, so we needed to have the conversations with them so that they understand why this is important, what they can do to help and how it makes a difference. We are seeing the fruits of that labour already. Biosecurity officers at our international airports are already reporting improved compliance from travellers, which is wonderful to see. Rates of undeclared risk items and undeclared contaminated footwear were down. I want to thank absolutely everyone who is doing the right thing; it really does make a huge difference, and we are so grateful to you for helping keep this disease at bay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know some people want to see our borders close, and this is something that the minister has said is not necessary at this stage. It's not what the experts say is needed. Groups like the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Meat Industry Council, the Victorian Farmers Federation, Meat and Livestock Australia, AgForce, the Australian Livestock Exporters Council and the NT Cattlemen's Association also don't believe it will help either. We will keep working with industry and the experts to get the response right. Right now, Australia remains foot-and-mouth disease free, and we are working hard every day to keep it that way. I want to thank everyone working on this across the industry, in our airports and in our mail centres, as well as travellers, importers and everyone who is doing the right thing to protect our crucial agriculture industry. Let's keep it up. Keep working together to protect our beloved farmers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  The AUSVETPLAN disease strategy for foot-and-mouth disease says that foot-and-mouth is the single biggest threat to Australia's livestock industries and an outbreak would cause far-reaching economic and social disruption in many parts of the community, including increased unemployment in the rural sector. I urge the government to take this extremely seriously. Every farmer that I met at the recent dairy conference was unbelievably concerned, and everyone who's contacted my office is the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would encourage the government to invest even more in Indonesia and be that good neighbour, because every dollar spent in Indonesia will save over $1,000 in Australia. Stop it in Indonesia before it gets here. I want to see everyone and everyone's luggage screened. Every single person is a high risk, not just those who are deemed to be a high risk. Everyone is a high risk. They don't tell the truth on those forms. I don't know how you can possibly identify who is a high risk and who is not when often the people who work in the tourist areas actually live in those rural areas where the high risk exists. So there are real issues there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on a fact and make it a bit real for people. People in this place know that I'm a dairy farmer and was before I came into this place, and our family is still dairy farming. In our dairy business, this would be really hard to deal with. In fact, it would break our hearts. We know that one outbreak is going to shut down every movement for 72 hours. We know that if one positive is found then potentially it could be two years before we get to export again. That's if we've got the stock. At my dairy farm, I'm likely to get a regional veterinary officer, who will come to our place and test every animal. If we get one positive, nothing moves—no-one in, no-one out, and not our milk either. Then that positive will mean that there will be a cull, and the 50-plus years that we've put into the breeding of our herd, our beautiful cows, will be gone. They'll be shot and either burnt or buried. Then everyone within at least a three-kilometre radius will be tested, depending on what they might find in that area, and there will be an absolute freeze on any movement in that to start with. Every positive in that perimeter, every single time, will increase that area and that perimeter. There will be no animals on our farm till the regional vet officer says so, which will be two years at least. So what do we do?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It affects all our local businesses. I did a quick rundown for Harvey. I thought, 'Who's going to be affected by this in my patch?' Harvey Fresh, which produces milk and dairy products, Harvey Water, where we get our irrigation, and LP &amp; JA Fryer, which we get all our services from. There'll be no income. We saw the massive effect of deregulation in our patch. There will be no animals into or out of Harvey Beef. They won't be exporting as they do now. Milne Feeds, who supply the feed; the grain and feed merchants; the livestock agent; the livestock transporters—all of those will be affected, just in my patch alone. In WA, Mark Talbot said at that very meeting that his business would stop dead. He's been begging the state government for more washdown facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How much food and produce is going to be on the shelves will depend on how many animals are affected. It does last a bit longer in moist soils. Yes, we'll do everything we can to minimise the outbreak. But I'll tell you what worries me as well: the feral animals. If it gets in, how the heck will we ever get rid of it? That is a very deep concern for us on our farms. Every farmer is desperately concerned about this. So I would say to the government: what you've done so far—get into Indonesia. Do even more in Indonesia. Do what you can do to stop it there, and let's stop this getting in. Everybody needs to do the right thing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  Before I get to the meat of my written speech, I want to address a few issues. The member for Wannon, in an absolutely unhinged contribution, asked: 'Why isn't all luggage being screened? Why isn't all food being banned?' He claimed that farmers wants the borders closed. I looked online, and there's a small group of farmers in his electorate who do want the borders closed, but I'll tell you who doesn't want the borders closed. The National Farmers Federation, the Australian Livestock Exporters Council, the Australian Meat Industry Council, the Cattle Council of Australia and Sheep Producers Australia all oppose closing the border. If the member for Wannon is going to come into this chamber and claim that farmers want the border closed, he needs to go and have a talk to these groups, which represent the vast majority of livestock interests in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forrest, in a thoughtful contribution, mentioned the impacts that FMD might have on a farm such as hers. Nobody argues with that. We know, in the government, that FMD is a very serious and significant issue that we are dealing with. But I've got to say this: before this outbreak in Indonesia, there was a nine per cent chance of FMD coming to Australia; it's gone up to 11 per cent. Nobody disputes that the risk has gone up. But all those risks to dairying and cattle that the member for Forrest was talking about existed before this outbreak, and there was still a nine per cent chance of it happening then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, it's really important that we turn off the panic switch. And it's not just me saying that. New South Wales Farmers Biosecurity Chair Ian McColl is quoted as saying that politicians are 'fanning the flames of fear'. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Farmers have argued for stronger, sustainably-funded biosecurity systems for years—this isn't something that's just happened overnight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He made the point that FMD is of course endemic throughout Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and it has been for years. He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Those people out there who suggested we need to slam shut travel to Indonesia don't understand that would only give a false sense of security, which could actually increase the risk of FMD coming from elsewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's up to all of us to do the right thing and stop spreading fear and rumour.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I implore those opposite who represent the regions, who represent farming interests, to put your farmers first, put your regions first and stop fanning the flames of fear. Stop spreading fear on this issue. The government is taking this issue very seriously. It's put in some of the strongest biosecurity measures seen in this country's history. It's working with Indonesian authorities to limit the spread to make sure that it doesn't come onto our shores. It's implemented the foot pads. It's implemented tighter screening. The Australian government stands shoulder to shoulder with the regions and with the farming interests in this country to keep FMD out of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any suggestion by those opposite that the Australian government is not doing everything reasonable and proper on this issue is just fearmongering; that's exactly what it is. And it's not just me saying that. That's New South Wales farmers saying to those opposite, 'Stop fanning the flames of fear.' It might be in your political interests to try and generate a headline, to try and get your faces in the paper. But it's not in the national interest for you to do that. You're affecting our overseas markets with your behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foot-and-mouth disease is absolutely one of the most concerning and dangerous diseases facing Australia's agricultural industry. It can devastate agricultural sectors. In recent months it has spread throughout Indonesia, including Bali. That's why the government is taking it very seriously, with the tighter measures that we have implemented. People across my electorate are understandably concerned, but the farmers in my electorate are also mature, and they have a strong streak of common sense. They know that the government is taking the threat seriously and that panic does not help anyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gross farmgate value of agricultural production in Tasmania exceeded $2 billion for the first time in 2021, due in no small part to the irrigation schemes the former Labor state government initiated. And Labor is determined to protect Tasmania's agricultural sector. The Albanese Labor government is determined to keep foot-and-mouth disease out of Australia, and I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Senator Murray Watt, for his tireless efforts, which will no doubt continue. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  I've listened with interest to the contributions to this debate on foot-and-mouth disease from both sides, and I think there is great deal of goodwill here. While there have been some political statements, I don't think there needs to be, because this is an issue we can deal with based on the facts. I've certainly worked very hard in the last few weeks to get across the facts and understand exactly what the issues are.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tuesday a fortnight ago, the Great Southern Zone of the WA Farmers Federation called a meeting of members and interested parties in the town of Mount Barker at very short notice. I had a commitment in Esperance that morning, 470 kilometres away, but I thought I'd better get to this meeting, because obviously this topic is something that's of great importance to my constituents. Those of you who've been to meetings of farm groups will know that usually you're lucky if 10 diehards turn up. So I was quite stunned when I arrived at the meeting. There were 150 people, which was the maximum that they could fit into the Plantagenet Sporting Club's Sounness Park recreation facility. There were another 591 people who had joined that meeting via live stream. So that is the level of interest and concern among my constituents.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development gave a very concise and pertinent update to the people at that meeting, and they explained AUSVETPLAN. My good friend the member for Paterson was wrong to say there was no plan. AUSVETPLAN, the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan, has been in place since 2014. Both departmental vets and commercial vets, including vets across my electorate, have travelled to places like Nepal, where they've dealt with foot-and-mouth disease in the flesh, so to speak, and gained experience. So there is a very comprehensive plan that will kick into place upon an incursion into this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of that incursion—just to touch on some of the issues that have already been mentioned—would be an immediate three-day freeze on the movement of animals, meat, milk and other livestock products. That's small bickies compared to the ongoing impact of the loss of trade access. As has already been mentioned here, the federal Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in their briefing—and thank you to Minister Watt for the briefing that he provided to all members last week—indicated that the best-case scenario for regaining that trade access after a small incursion that was jumped on and controlled immediately would be at least several years. For a country that exports 70 per cent of its livestock products—and Western Australia exports 90 per cent of its livestock products—the damage that that would do to my communities and my industries is beyond my comprehension. In Great Britain in 2001, the incursion reached 56 properties. There were six million livestock destroyed, and today, 20 years later, their industry is only back to 70 per cent of what it was in 2001. This is the sort of impact we're talking about on the communities across my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot speak on this issue without drawing the attention of the chamber and the House to the comments of the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture and Food. The Western Australian Minister for Agriculture and Food, when she was questioned on this issue—and I'm quoting directly from the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper here—said the disease 'would "not be catastrophic" and could even lead to cheaper meat and milk'. I'm not going to say any more about that, other than that today we had a passenger at the Darwin airport who was intercepted with a sausage-and-egg McMuffin and a ham-and-cheese croissant in their baggage. That customer had filled out a declaration form stating that they had no food products in their luggage. I can only assume that that passenger may well have seen the media on the comments of the Western Australian minister that this is no big deal and, in fact, you might even get a bit of cheap meat. Well, I say to the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture and Food: yes, you might get a bit of cheap meat while livestock are being destroyed and farmers are going out of business, but it won't last very long, because we won't have a domestic livestock industry if we lose that 90 per cent export market. She should be thoroughly ashamed of herself, and everybody around the country who has heard those comments, except Labor politicians, has called for her resignation. I urge her to do the honourable thing and stand aside and let someone that the farmers of WA have confidence in take that position.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:38</span>):  I was in a party called the National Party for 23 years. I had the same recognition rate in Queensland as the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and I was the standard-bearer for that party. When I came into this place, I got lectures from a bloke who was very tall and wore a hat. I'm not going to talk about the dead, but he said, 'We will have free markets and we will be the food bowl of Asia, because we have a clean, green image.' I quote: 'clean, green image'. He then opened the door, under his free market ideology, to every single product known to man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said: 'Please don't let the prawns in. If you allow prawns we will get white spot.' White spot is now in our country, costing us hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Tobacco was allowed in. Grapes were allowed in, and you know the California grapes contain the glassy-winged sharpshooter—only the Americans could think of a name like that, but it's a terrible disease. The pork was let in. The peanuts were let in. Everything was let in. How can you possibly promote yourself with a clean, green image when you allow everything in? Of course every disease will come in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Kennedy, we have been very much on the receiving end of these diseases. We've got Panama disease, which has closed very large sections of the banana industry in Australia. I represent almost every banana in Australia. We all know how citrus canker hit the citrus industry. Again, we pleaded with them not to bring the stuff in. The then leader of my party—not the gentleman with the hat; another gentleman, the leader of the party—gave special permission for citrus product and shoots to come in from South-East Asia, from a country that was known to have citrus canker, and, of course, there was a very generous donation given to what was then my party. Black sigatoka, papaya fruit fly—I could go on and on and on, but let me address the issue of the trade with Indonesia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Julia Gillard, then Prime Minister of Australia—I'm not denigrating her, because I don't think she understood what she was doing, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> has a lot to answer for here—banned the live export of meat into Indonesia. They have been excellent neighbours to us. Every country has neighbours, but they have been truly excellent neighbours. Compare them to Canada and Mexico with the United States. They have been excellent neighbours to us. Quite rightly, two weeks later, the former Prime Minister realised her mistake and reversed the decision, but you don't start telling the fifth-biggest country on Earth, 'We're going to turn the trade off, and now you can turn it back on again.' That doesn't happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They quite rightly banned the export of livestock into Indonesia, and that went on for nearly two years. It was one of the reasons why I took a stand and had some persuasive influence on Kevin Rudd being returned. I want to say, in great praise of Kevin Rudd—who, it seems to me, is maligned by both sides of the House—that within nine days of being restored to the prime ministership, he was in Indonesia. Within 13 days the market was reopened, and within two months the price of cattle had doubled. To the day I die, I'll be very proud of having played a small role in putting that person in where we could get that problem solved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this issue, I rang Sam Daniels, one of the bigger cattle owners in Australia; Mark Harvey-Sutton, a pivotal leader in the industry, who comes from my hometown; Garth Power, another very prominent cattleman in mid-west North Queensland; Russell Lethbridge, highly representative on many bodies; and Sheep McCarthy, the current president of Australian farmers for North Queensland, and arguably northern Australia. I spoke to these people, and I'll single out Sam Daniels, who said, 'We need to send 32.6 million over to Indonesia straight away.' It is not a huge problem for them. It's something that needs to be done— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dunkley is a magnificent place to live. Most of my electorate is contained within the Frankston LGA, and some of my electorate, Mount Eliza, is within the Mornington Peninsula shire LGA. We're all in the South Eastern Melbourne Primary Health Network. It's a magnificent place to live, but, in Frankston, we do have some significant health issues. For example, emergency department presentations in the Frankston LGA are at just over 5½ thousand per 100,000 residents; The Victoria average is 3½ thousand. Urgent presentations are at 14,000 per 100,000; the Victorian average is just under 10½ thousand. Non-urgent presentations are at 1,500 per 100,000; for the rest of the South Eastern Melbourne Primary Health Network, it's just 1.3.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019-20, Frankston had the highest number of lower urgency after-hours emergency department hospital presentations in our health network. That's almost 22 per cent per 100,000. We don't have enough GPs to service an area which has significant chronic health difficulties. We have significantly higher-than-average rates of arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease and the associated risk factors, such as poor dietary intake, obesity and physical inactivity. They're the highest in the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something that concerns me greatly—many people would know why—is that, of women aged 50 to 74, just under 50 per cent participate in breast screening, whereas the Victorian average is 53.6 per cent. We have, almost unavoidably, a higher avoidable mortality rate for breast cancer—19 per 100,000—than the average for the region, which is just 16. We have higher numbers than average for our region's circulatory systems diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, colorectal cancer and respiratory diseases. We have significantly higher-than-average levels of obesity. And we have more residents than the rest of our region who experience cost as a barrier to accessing the healthcare system. No-one should experience cost as a barrier to accessing the universal healthcare system in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years now—almost since I was first elected—doctors, particularly in Frankston, Langwarrin and Carrum Downs, have been telling me they cannot attract enough GPs for their bulk-billing clinics. It has been a chronic problem that I lobbied the former government about over and over again, because we were not a distribution priority area for the recruitment of doctors. We kept getting told by the former government and the department that there was no problem. Yet we know there was, on the ground, and there has been until recently. It continues, but it's, hopefully, about to change. Jill, who's 80 years old, from Carrum Downs, contacted me because her preferred centre, the Ballarto Medical Centre, couldn't get her an appointment for five days, even though they wanted to, because they don't have enough bulk-billing doctors. We know that it's a problem in regional and rural areas in this country. It's talked about a lot, and more needs to be done. But it's also a big problem in the outer metropolitan areas, and before this current government, we often didn't feature in the conversation. That's why I'm so pleased that we've already delivered on the election commitment that the minister made to my electorate, which was that Frankston would be a distribution priority area, and it now is. It's not going to change overnight, but now my clinics can go and recruit not just Australian GPs—we know we need to produce many more Australian GPs—but also GPs from overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that we're doing in my electorate is establishing an urgent care clinic to address the numbers of presentations at emergency rooms, to take the pressure off the hospital but also to make sure that people who have broken arms and legs, cuts and bruises, issues that they need to present urgently to get addressed but aren't as critical as many things that go to an emergency room, can get looked after immediately by a bulk-billing clinic by nurses and GPs. There'll be 50 across the country. One of them will be in Dunkley. Again, that's the difference between a government that thinks about and delivers on health care and one that doesn't.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  I appreciate the government's intentions in changing distribution priority areas, DPAs, to automatically include all Modified Monash Model level 2 and some level 1 areas, but the cost of this decision will be borne by the regions—rural people. People in regional Australia already have significantly worse health outcomes than people living in metropolitan areas, and it's vital to keep this in mind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The DPA was set up as a measure of last resort to make a broader pool of doctors, including those trained overseas, eligible for Medicare in communities having difficulty attracting doctors. Overseas trained doctors may practise in these locations for a time before they receive an unrestricted Medicare provider number to practise anywhere in Australia. So now we're going to have a system where metropolitan Elizabeth, in the Playford council, with a population of approximately 100,000 people, is treated the same as remote Kangaroo Island, with a population of less than 5,000. Now capital city Hobart, with a population of near a quarter of a million, is going to be treated the same as my little town in Birdwood, population 1,200, and Milang, population 850—areas with no public transport or regular access to medical services. And what's happening now is that doctors are cancelling their contracts in remote and regional Australia, going and living in North Adelaide, and they'll drive out to Elizabeth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Rural Doctors Association of Australia and the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine have expressed concern about expanding the DPA to these centres and outer metropolitan areas, saying that it will erode already limited access to health care in rural Australia. The RDA reports that some overseas trained doctors have already resigned. They've cancelled their contracts. They've withdrawn their applications to practise in the regions as a result of these changes. The RDA president, Dr Megan Belot, has stated, 'We have already received very early indicators of how this policy change will wreak havoc in the bush.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our doctors are the backbone of primary health care in the regions. It's already hard enough to attract doctors, even in relatively inner regional areas in parts of my electorate. The RDA anticipate this move will further diminish the chances of regional, rural and remote communities attracting doctors if no other measures are put in place for those communities. Several of our communities in Mayo already experience severe difficulty in this regard. Last month, the only general practice in the town of Meadows closed its doors, leaving around 2,000 people looking for alternative care some distance away—and there's no public transport available. The city isn't just 20 kilometres down the road. Residents in Yankalilla, a DPA listed area located on the Fleurieu Peninsula, have lost one of their two GP clinics. The average age in Yankalilla is around 68. With the remaining clinic already at capacity, residents now need to travel further if they can find a doctor who is taking new patients. They can't get on a bus to do that. They have to rely on someone to drive them if they can't drive themselves. Closures will lead to older people in our communities, those who do not have access to transport and those who have need for chronic illness care deferring primary health care. This is going to dramatically affect their quality of life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally dire is Kangaroo Island, which relies on sea and air transport to access medical support on the mainland. Chronic doctor shortages have resulted in the short-term closure of Kangaroo Island Health Service obstetric and theatre services. Expectant mothers have been asked to relocate off island for weeks around their due date. The flow-on effects on the island are huge. Pregnant women and their partners are not on island to care for their other children, run their farms and businesses and, in one case, to carry out their duties as a local GP. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to urgently work with key groups to fix the mess that they have now created. Leeching doctors from our underserviced regional and remote areas, where we already know we have poorer health outcomes, is outrageous. Just because they are a Labor seat—</span>

Quite frankly, it's outrageous, and it's a big problem that is of the making of this new government. I have deep concerns for regional Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  My electorate of Paterson is home to approximately 137,000 people. The health care for those people has deteriorated over the last 10 years. That is a fact. Last year, I met with the managers of local GP practices because the doctors couldn't spare the time to come and meet with me, such is the pressure for appointments. They had to send their practice managers, and, in fact, some of those practice managers were in tears describing the stress that they, and their GPs, are under. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The largest amount of correspondence I get in my inbox, by far, is about health care. Indeed, it's about trying to get an appointment at the doctors—and let's not even talk about specialists' appointments in rural and regional Australia. It is an abomination in this day and age to think that people have to wait years in some circumstances to see a specialist. What I have been hearing time and time again is that, in Australia at the moment, of all the people who graduate from medical school, about 12 per cent of them go into general practice. In the 1970s, roughly 50 per cent of people went into general medicine. Now, people are gravitating towards specialisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will do more to encourage more people to go into generalist medicine. We need that, and we need those people to come to regional and rural Australia. In a place like beautiful Port Stephens, a lot of people come to retire—they often describe it, with tongue in cheek, as God's waiting room. Well, it is a magnificent part of the world, and we do have a lot of experienced Australians. However, a lot of people also want to come to Port Stephens to holiday. And, at times, our population there is fivefold what it normally is. This puts the medical profession in Port Stephens under immense pressure. Tomaree Hospital gets absolutely inundated, and not only over the summer; we're seeing more and more people coming to enjoy our whale-watching season in the winter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our GPs in Port Stephens are experienced, too. In fact, many of them have thought about retiring. But they just can't, because there isn't a replacement. That's why I am particularly pleased to talk about the course of action we have taken in, firstly, saying, 'You know what? A town like Kurri Kurri, in my electorate, or a town like Nelson Bay isn't the same as the CBD in Sydney. It is an area of need for medicine.' I'm pleased to say that our government has taken action to ensure that we can recruit doctors to places like beautiful Port Stephens and Kurri Kurri. The Medicare taskforce is going to review the bulk-billing rebates for local GPs. That's such an important thing, too, because we know it is now harder than ever to run a practice. And we need these practices to be able to be prosperous. We need to encourage people back into medicine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that creative recruitment and training of international and local doctors is so important in getting them to come to the bush, to seats like Paterson. The MRI licence at the Maitland Hospital is something else that I have campaigned on, and I am so delighted to say that an Albanese government is going to deliver an MRI licence for the Maitland Hospital MRI machine so that people can be bulk-billed when they need an all-important MRI for diagnosis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is always going to support Medicare, and we are always going to deliver for people when it comes to health care. We just absolutely fundamentally understand how important health care is, and we understand it in places like Paterson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">GP access is also one of the critical things that help to alleviate the pressure on emergency waiting rooms. No-one wants to sit in the ER with a sick child or relative and think, 'I'm going to be here for eight hours.' We're going to take the pressure off those ER waiting times because we know that people want that so desperately in regional and rural areas. There's a lot of work to do, but be assured, we are working with medical professionals to ensure better health for all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  When you're sick and you need a doctor, it should not be a herculean task to get an appointment. However, doctor shortages exacerbate poorer health outcomes for everyone, in particular those in regional and rural towns. I can speak for my experience in Mallee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 46th Parliament I worked hard with the then Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, on solutions for this problem. These measures included making telehealth permanent, thanks to COVID. We funded 80 Commonwealth supported places for rural medical programs so students could study in the regions. We know that 60 per cent of those who study in the regions will stay there. We provided HECS-HELP for doctors and nurse practitioners to have their HECS-HELP reimbursed at the completion of time in the bush. We also incentivised the rural bulk-billing incentive and increased it. We permanently retained telehealth. In the last two years, over 100 million telehealth services have been delivered to more than 17 million people, with a cost of $5.1 billion. Telehealth increased access, reduced travel time, reduced the risks of sitting in waiting rooms, where others might have COVID, and reduced waiting times for patients in regional and rural areas to see a doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous coalition government also funded $114.2 million, which includes further Commonwealth supported places, so students could study medicine regionally. I recently had the pleasure of attending Charles Sturt University's new Mallee Clinical School in Swan Hill, which will benefit under this initiative. I also advocated for this program in Mildura and worked and will continue to work with La Trobe and Monash universities to see that rural secondary school students can have a closed pipeline from year 12 all the way through their postgraduate course. I have already raised this with the new Minister for Education, Jason Clare, and will be raising it with the new Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, when I meet with him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have two concerns about the recent changes to health policy under the new government. The first is the expansion of the Distribution Priority Area classification system, as recently announced by the Minister for Health and Aged Care, which outlined the expansion of the DPA to modified Monash 2 areas. As we heard from the member for Dunkley, international and bonded medical students can now go to Frankston instead of to Mildura or Ouyen or Swan Hill or Horsham—regional areas that are desperate for doctors. It doesn't take two guesses to work out where those doctors would prefer to be; it would be somewhere where there are lots and lots of patients, lots of other doctors and lots of hospitals who can support them. More needs to be done. This solution by the minister for health is not a solution at all, and it will detract from health care in our regional and rural areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Dunkley spoke about a patient who has to wait for five days for an appointment. I can tell her and I'll tell this chamber that in my communities people are waiting four weeks to see a GP. We have older doctors who are retiring, and they need to retire. One of them is my husband. We have very few new doctors coming to our regional areas. This is a huge concern, and this government will now be held to account for the policies it is putting in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a question about the 50 urgent care clinics that this government is putting in place—one in Dunkley. That's excellent. Mallee is 83½ thousand square kilometres. Will there be one in Mallee at all? That is my question to the minister for health. It is a reasonable question. A lot of patients prefer to be bulk-billed, especially if there are plenty of doctors who are bulk-billing. The bulk-billing fees need to increase. Urgent care clinics—they are a great idea—need to be more than a platitude. They need to help us in regional settings. I'm concerned that, despite the health inequity in my electorate, the dire need for more government funding and the fact that Mildura is in the top 50 cities in Australia by population, my electorate will not see one of these urgent care clinics.</span>

During the election campaign, I spoke to literally hundreds of Boothby residents, who told me it had become harder—and more expensive—under the previous government to see a doctor or access the health care they needed. I also spoke to a surprisingly large number of people who told me of their personal experience of ambulance ramping—of long delays for an ambulance. People would stop me in shopping centres to tell me about their mother's experience, their neighbour's experience, their own experience or their child's. These stories only confirmed what was obvious in South Australia under the previous state and federal Liberal governments—that ours was a health system in crisis, one with record levels of ramping and hospital overcrowding. That's why I was so keen during the campaign to ensure that federal Labor delivered better health services for the people of Boothby. It's why I'm so proud to be able to say, as we announced during the campaign, that the Albanese Labor government will be delivering a new Medicare urgent care clinic in Boothby at Bedford Park to support the Flinders Medical Centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The urgent care clinic at Bedford Park will complement the joint initiative between the Malinauskas state Labor government and the Albanese federal government to deliver a $400 million expansion of Flinders Medical Centre. This will equip the centre with the ability to deliver high-quality services to all of southern Adelaide and will complement the urgent care clinic being set up in Adelaide's south, at Noarlunga. Together, these will address the needs of those using Flinders Medical Centre, which are not only the residents from Boothby but also those from Kingston and many parts of Mayo, for whom Flinders Medical Centre is the nearest tertiary hospital. This redevelopment will deliver 160 more desperately needed hospital beds, an expanded intensive care unit, a redeveloped inpatient mental health unit and improved care for older South Australians, including a new 24-bed ward at the Repat Health Precinct as a hub for older people to access health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, importantly, the urgent care clinic at Bedford Park, the one at Noarlunga and the three others like it to be established across South Australia will help take the pressure off the front end of our tertiary health system—our extremely stressed emergency departments. They will be a diversion for the emergency departments, ensuring that doctors and nurses in ED can focus on the true emergencies. It will also make it easier for families in Boothby to see a doctor or a nurse when they have an urgent, but not life-threatening, need for care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us in this place who have raised or helped care for young children know all too well that blurred decision line, usually in the middle of the night, when you're up with a sick child, wondering to yourself: 'Are they sick enough for the emergency department? Is there another option that would work better? I really don't want to be waiting with my child for eight hours.' I know that Australians and the people of Boothby don't want to add to the pressures on our hospital system and its emergency departments unnecessarily. That's what will make this Medicare urgent care clinic so valuable and so vital for the people in Boothby. It will provide time-critical and, crucially, bulk-billed treatments to Boothby residents who don't need a hospital emergency department. This will include injuries such as sprains, broken bones, minor burns and ear and eye problems. These clinics are a practical, real example of Labor's commitment to strengthen Medicare and take the pressure off families in Boothby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By comparison, when we look at the record under the previous government, out-of-pocket costs to see a GP in Boothby went up by 35 per cent, and now they want to lecture us, as a new government, on cost of living. In my previous working life, I have run health services across the state. I know what the pressure is, I know how difficult it is, and I know that people make decisions based on whether they think they can actually afford to get health care. That's why I have advocated so strongly for this urgent care clinic in Boothby—because it's so important for people to have access to urgent care, without what are often prohibitive out-of-pocket costs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  I want to talk about sugar. The member for Barker has just come in on duty. I wish he'd been here to hear the member for Mayo's address and the member for Mallee's address. If you put the two together you have a description of the whole sugar-coated mess that, within two weeks of the parliament, you have created for regional people in Australia. Just like that. It is one decision that is going to have huge ramifications for every regional area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already have a massive shortage of doctors, which I've talked about so many times. My beautiful township of Moe hasn't been able to get doctors for years. It struggles to get doctors. People have to travel to Traralgon and to Trafalgar for any doctors' services. We spend weeks waiting. In Moe it takes six weeks to get in. You're pretty firmly damaged by the time you have to wait for a doctor for six weeks. So what do you do? You go straight to the emergency department in Traralgon or in Morwell, don't you? You have to. What alternative have you got?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under COVID, and for other reasons when I talk about sugar, the Australian population is becoming more unwell, because our policies don't talk about caring for those people prior to them getting ill. We're quite happy that people are consuming more and more fast food and more and more sugar. People are becoming unwell because of their lifestyle and then expect to go in and get a pill from the doctor to fix it. But things that we should be promoting to make a difference to health care are not being promoted. Many years ago we did. 'Life. Be in it.' was the program, and there have been others since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this small change, which they thought would be politically wonderful, really damages the opportunities for our regions. The new Labor government made all its promises on health care, and what did the promoter of this particular scheme say? 'We deliver.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was the sugar-coating 12 years ago? It was called: we're going to have 50 super clinics, and they are going to alleviate the hospitals. Fifty of them right across Australia. What did we get in the term of the government? Was it five or nine? And then it was completely forgotten about. By the way, the five, which have probably been being taken over by private organisations, were all in—well, Labor-held seats were the first ones to get up at those times. I'm pretty sure Mildura didn't get one. There were parts of Adelaide that didn't get one. Parts of mostly regional Australia never heard of one, because there was no money to be made in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had incentive after incentive for doctors to come. In my time we created a medical school for doctors at Monash University in Latrobe Valley. John Howard gave us 40 places for doctors to be trained. We still have a medical training centre in Warrigal because we know, and we knew then, that if you can train a medical person in an area they're likely to, hopefully, fall in love with someone and stay. But that's the only way you're going to get them. You've got to train them in the country so they accept the opportunities in the regions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This change in policy actually turns its back on the regions and destroys opportunities for people to grow their country communities, because who's going to go to a country community if they can't get a doctor? Who? Who's going to go to Parkes? Who's going to come to my electorate of Monash? No, they're not. It's a typical new government making a crazy mistake. It's a sugar-coated disaster, and that is how it will be seen. The people of my electorate will know exactly how they've been dudded by this government. They've been dudded at the most crucial part of their families' being: the health care by their GP, which they can't find.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  In my electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast, we have been experiencing a worsening GP shortage for years. It's no secret by now that regional and rural Australia have more trouble getting and retaining GPs than our cities. Our GPs are overworked and struggling to keep up with the growing demand from COVID, a hospital system that is broken and not coping, and an ageing population that needs increasingly more time and more care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Eurobodalla part of my electorate, the community have been waiting an incredibly long time for a new hospital. I have been right there with them, fighting to make sure this is a level 4 hospital that can give local people the services that they need now and into the future. What we don't want and cannot afford is a new hospital that may work for right now but isn't equipped to deal with the growing needs of our community. The current hospital system is just not fit for purpose, and we don't want just a new version of this model; we need a better one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you combine the GP shortage with an inadequate hospital system and an ageing population, what you get is a community whose health needs cannot possibly be met. The end result of this is twofold. Firstly, people are forced to travel to where they can get the right services. This is problematic for so many reasons: it sees increased medical costs, it sees delays in critical care and it sees patients put through harrowing ordeals just to get help. The second result is that people simply move away. I have heard this all too often from local people who want to stay, but for whom, as they get older or their health needs become more complicated, it becomes impossible. They just can't get the help they need, so they have to live somewhere else. It isn't just those who are ageing for whom this is a problem; it is families, young people and cancer sufferers. Anytime a health issue arises, this is a problem. And it just isn't good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The dual issues of a GP crisis and a hospital system at breaking point put each other in a negative feedback loop. The fewer GPs there are, the more people need to turn to the hospital. The more strain the hospital is under, the more people need good GPs to turn to. This is exactly why Labor has come up with the urgent care clinic model. The aim is to support our GPs while helping to take pressure off the hospital system so it can cope with the really critical cases. That's why I fought for and committed to a Medicare urgent care clinic for Batemans Bay as well as a radiotherapy centre in Moruya: because I am tired of hearing stories of local people having to seek care so far away. I'm tired of hearing from local GPs who are under too much pressure. I want to see our community getting the help they need when and where they need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The medical urgent care clinics will be there when someone has an urgent but not life-threatening need for care. Things like broken bones, cuts, minor burns and wound care can all be done by GPs and nurses at the urgent care clinic. They will be bulk-billed to make sure the services are affordable and local people won't be out of pocket. Each clinic will be based on what the community needs in local GP clinics or community health centres and will provide funding support to local doctors to stay open longer, increase doctors and nurses and upgrade their equipment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how critical this infrastructure is for the South Coast, but I also know it isn't enough. I'm committed to doing everything I can to support local health workers to provide high-quality services without sending them to breaking point. One policy alone is not going to solve the health crisis facing regional communities. There is a lot that still needs to be done, and I know lots of local people working in these fields have fantastic ideas to share. Recently I met with our Primary Health Network and local doctors to talk about the health challenges facing the South Coast community. I plan to continue these discussions so I can feed that knowledge back to the minister. There's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to regional health, so I'm excited to keep working with our community so we can get the mix right for us all.</span>

If you went to the dictionary and looked up the word 'irony', it would point you to the member for Gilmore's speech. The towns that she spoke about, where she's having the problems, would have already been DPA. Now, to get the doctors needed to those smaller, more remote towns, she is going to have compete with peri-urban and larger regional centres. You have a responsibility, when you're in your party room, to understand what's being put up. And regional Labor MPs—even though there aren't many—should be taking notice of this, because this is bad policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was minister for regional health I had delegations and I visited clinics where you could actually see the skyline of the city, and they were telling me how they needed more doctors, because, obviously, overseas trained doctors are helping those clinics and the profitability of those clinics. Members from capital cities are talking about this. If you're a woman in Bourke and you want to have a baby, the nearest birthing centre is Dubbo. That's four hours drive one way. If you haven't got a doctor in Bourke so you can have prenatal care and care for your young child, that is a serious concern. We had these distribution priority areas so that towns like Bourke and Brewarrina and Nyngan could give doctors an incentive. When I was regional health minister we graduated the payments under Medicare. If you are in an MM 5 area, you get a higher rebate for bulk-billing than you do in an MM 1 or MM 2 area. That came in on 1 January and was a positive step.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are training country people to do medicine. In Dubbo, 500 students applied for 24 positions in the Murray-Darling medical school. They are brilliant young local people from the bush who are going to overcome this shortage. When I was minister we doubled the number of training places for junior doctors to spend time in regional areas. We increased the number of doctors doing the generalist pathway so that, when doctors are coming out and are trained, they've got a broader set of skills. They've got the confidence to go to a country town where they might have to deal with general medicine all day and then a horrible event where a car load of teenagers hits a tree on a Friday night. They've got the skill set to have the confidence to go to these places. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was regional health minister we set up five trial sites looking at innovative models of primary care, combining the resources of the state government, through the local health district, and the federal government, to address the reasons why people aren't taking up general practice training. We had a model that was comparable to that for staff working in the cities—there's maternity leave, holiday pay and a whole range of other things. It is about making general practice more attractive for people to take it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt there's a shortage of doctors in this country. There's no doubt about that. We are looking at all practical measures, and I'll support the current government on all the practical measures they take to improve that pool of doctors. But taking doctors from the most remote and disadvantaged communities as a sop to larger peri-urban areas and regional centres is not the answer to health care in the bush. </span>

                  <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence Industry and Minister for International Development and the Pacific</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  I rise very proudly to speak on the motion moved by my colleague and friend the member for Dunkley and to thank her for recognising that the Albanese government is delivering on its commitments in health policy at a lightning pace. It's clear from the last government's policies, and also the last member's contribution, that the one thing that the last government cared less about than Medicare was large regional areas like my home, the Hunter, which has a right to representation and a right to services. The last government seemed to think that you only had the bush and large capital cities but nothing in between, and it showed a blatant disregard for communities like mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was very pleased to right that wrong a couple of weeks ago when I joined with my colleagues on the Central Coast and in the Hunter and we announced that our regions were now classified as distribution priority areas to help combat the dire GP shortages across our regions. I'm proud to represent a regional electorate in this place. The truth is that changes made by the Liberals in 2015 reclassifying my home region as not being a priority area for GPs hurt my region most grievously. To classify suburbs in Shortland such as Cardiff and Windale—which is the poorest postcode and the most disadvantaged community in all of New South Wales—as having the same access to medical services as Vaucluse and Mosman was insulting and showed a great misunderstanding of my region. That's why my Labor colleagues and I have been lobbying over the past 2½ years to get this reversed, and that's why I was so pleased that we delivered on one of our election commitments so fast two weeks ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise the efforts and the lobbying of the Hunter General Practitioners Association, led by Dr Fiona van Leeuwen and Dr Lee Fong. They've been passionate advocates for this reclassification, and they are working to improve all areas of primary health care, because the truth is that we need a multipronged approach to fix the challenges around general practice. The reclassification of our area is essential to that, because what happened in 2015 was a sledgehammer to my local general practices. The sledgehammer, which removed the ability of overseas trained doctors and doctors under Commonwealth bonded scholarships to practise in my area, made a massive negative impact in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bulk-billing is one of the most cherished cornerstones of our Medicare system, and the Liberals' changes to Medicare and the GP classification made it more difficult for people in my community to see a doctor and, if they do see a doctor, to see a doctor who bulk-bills. When I meet regularly with the Hunter GPs Association, I hear of practice after practice that has being forced to change its level of bulk-billing because of the last government's neglect and its wilful attacks on our region. You just have to see practices that have gone from 80 per cent bulk-billing to 20 per cent bulk-billing overnight. In this particular case, the changes in the distribution priority access area meant that we lost access to so many doctors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you an example of the practical impact of this, Madam Deputy Speaker. I attended the opening of new premises for the Swansea Medical Centre, which has great consulting rooms. Because of the change made by the last government, they had a consulting room completely empty every day of the week. They weren't open on Saturday or Sunday, and their books were closed despite the huge demand, because of the lack of distribution priority area access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this change will make a meaningful impact in large regional areas like mine, where a very significant number of Australians live. That's why I've fought for this change and I welcome it. It's part of a broader process of restoring Medicare to what it once was. The truth is that the last government learned from the example of Prime Minister Howard, who lost an election on a platform of abolishing Medicare. Instead they were a bit smarter and they tried to kill Medicare slice by slice, with co-payment charges, distribution area changes and all the other changes that are just making it a bit harder to see a doctor and, if you do see a doctor, to see a doctor who bulk-bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a down payment on restoring universal health care in this country and on making access to health care based on need rather than on credit card and wealth. So I welcome this change. I also welcome our election commitment on the GP after-hours access service. That will make a huge impact in my area. I want to thank the Minister for Health and Aged Care for his vision in this area, and I want to thank him for again putting priority on regional areas such as mine that so clearly deserve it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  In many ways there is still a great divide between city and country. There is a divide and an inequality in income. If you live in a country area, your income will not be as high as it would be if you lived in a city area. There is still a great divide in education, educational opportunities and educational outcomes. And there is definitely still a great divide in health outcomes. The cold, hard truth is that the further you live away from the city the younger you will die. The average life expectancy in the country is significantly less than it is in the city. That divide worsens as you move away from the city and go further out into the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One way that we can deal with this great divide and this huge inequality is by getting more GPs to the bush so that they can practise in the bush and bolster health services in country areas. This is really important because, as the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has noted, potentially avoidable hospitalisations can be 2½ times higher in remote areas than in cities. We have to bridge that great divide in health, so the distribution priority area system identifies areas in regional, rural and remote Australia with unmet need or lacking access to GP services. What it does is basically brings in overseas trained doctors and participants in the Bonded Medical Program. They have to set up in those distribution priority areas. It's all designed to bridge that great divide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what the new government has done is basically expanded distribution priority areas to include everything up to the outskirts of the major cities. It's no longer a program designed to get more GPs into country areas; it's expanding it to more metropolitan areas—</span>

                  </a>  Peri-urban areas, as the member for Barker says. Here are some of the new distribution priority areas around Australia. In Sydney, if you live in Hornsby—that's right—you're now in a GP distribution priority area. Hornsby is not Struggle Street. Warringah, Fairfield, Penrith, Rouse Hill, Richmond and Windsor are now distribution priority areas. It's absurd! In the Canberra region, Belconnen, Gungahlin and Fyshwick are now distribution priority areas for GPs. If you live in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, like in Frankston—yep, that's right—you're now in a distribution priority area. In Adelaide, suburbs like Mitcham; and, in Perth, suburbs like Kalamunda are now distribution priority areas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… were set up primarily to address the shortages of doctors in rural areas by mandating that Overseas Trained Doctors (OTDs) and rurally bonded medical students… spend time working in the bush …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To introduce this change, without the implementation of rural specific policies to address the very real issue of the maldistribution of the medical workforce across Australia, is very concerning for the future of rural general practice.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">We are fearful for rural communities right across Australia who are now at extreme risk of losing their doctors as they take up positions closer to the cities, abandoning their rural and remote patients who will be left with no access to care close to home at all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has not been a good decade for Australian women when it comes to the gender pay gap under the previous Liberal-National governments. In fact, the latest research released just a few weeks ago by KPMG shows that the gender pay gap in Australia is now worth almost $1 billion a week, or $51 billion a year. The report shows women are paid, on average, $2.55 an hour less than men. Of course, this has serious consequences for women at every stage of their working lives. It means that too many women who have spent their lives balancing work with caregiving for children, for elderly relatives and for others are facing older age in poverty and are at risk of homelessness. We do know that caregiving is a real factor in the gender pay gap and where that gap exists. Recent data from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency shows that the gender pay gap widens when women turn 35, an age when many women are caring for children, with women earning $7.78 for every $10 earned by their male counterparts. This disparity worsens over the next 10 years. This is one of the main reasons why there's more work to be done on how we support women to balance work and family in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's Paid Parental Leave scheme is a great Labor legacy. It's given women—particularly women in low-paid and insecure work—the opportunity to spend more time caring for their children. But it's now been more than a decade since my predecessor, the former member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin, introduced that game-changing reform, and it's time for an update. We do need a scheme that supports women—and men—to take time out of the workforce. Evidence from overseas shows us that the best way to do this is through a use-it-or-lose-it provision, so that we start to rebalance work and caring roles in our society, so it's not just women who take time out of our workplace and so that it's not taken as a given that a woman will interrupt her working life for an extended period of time—a year when her baby's born, working part-time until her children are eight—while absolutely nothing changes for men. Research from the OECD shows that those countries that include a non-transferable portion of leave, which must be taken by a father in their PPL schemes, have a higher uptake of men taking leave than those that don't. The research also shows us that, where dads participate more in child care and family life, children are better off and dads report greater life satisfaction. So this is a win-win-win, and it's an area that I hope our government will be able to act on over our term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government failed to close the gender pay gap. As a result, we have a massive wasted opportunity in this country. We have some of the most educated women in the world. And yet we have some of the lowest rates of women's participation in the workforce in the world. What a waste. Australian women are getting educated and are ready to work, and then they're coming up against a system that doesn't pay them as much as their male counterparts and actively discriminates against them when it comes to caring. We can do so much better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so proud to be part of a Labor government that will be different; that will do this work; that will make gender pay equity an object of the Fair Work Act; that will establish an independent women's economic security task force to help inform our investments in economic equality; that will strengthen the ability and capacity for the Fair Work Commission to order pay increases for workers in low-paid industries, such as aged care, most of which are dominated by women; that will introduce legislation that requires large companies to publicly report their gender pay gap, prohibit pay secrecy clauses and give employees the right to disclose their pay if they want to; and that will act on the gender pay gap within the Australian public service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are game-changing reforms. These are the things that will help Australian women catch up. That will start to close that gender pay gap, and that will allow us to look as a community and a society at how we balance roles across work and family so that both men and women get these opportunities to be productive parts of our workforce but also to be the people who care for our families, our children and our elderly. There is value in this work as well. As a community, we must make sure that we value women's contribution in the workforce and that women are paid properly for that contribution in the workforce so that they don't end up in poverty.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  I rise to support the motion. This parliament needs to move quickly to address and implement the efforts of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency in consultation with the previous coalition government in striving towards the elimination of gender discrimination, particularly the gender pay gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2022, the previous coalition government released its review of the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, which it had committed to in its Women's Budget Statement of the previous year. This review sought feedback from across the community to address workplace gender equality, while, importantly, also considering the needs of employers. The review heard from businesses, employers, employee organisations, women's organisations and academics through roundtables and written submissions. This review now comes at a critical time. There is real momentum for change towards achieving gender equality in Australian workplaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the previous coalition government, wages for women employed full time did increase by 20 per cent over the past five years, as against the wages of Australian men, which increased by 15 per cent. Nevertheless, the gender pay gap still exists. On average, Australian women are earning $255 a week less than Australian men. This figure is worse in the 45-to-64 age group, where, on average, women are earning $40,000 per year—$800 per week—less than Australian men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although Australian women enrol in and complete higher education and enter the labour market at a higher proportion than men, they are still substantially less likely to work full time across all age groups and less likely to reach the highest earning levels. This is because the predominant responsibility of family and caring duties falls on women. I know this from personal experience. I temporarily stepped away from my career—a legal career—in order to raise my twin sons full time. Even 16 years ago, when my sons were born, I battled against the perception in my workplace that it was not appropriate for a senior lawyer to work in a part-time capacity. Unfortunately, this story was all too common amongst my peers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been significant workplace attitudinal change towards flexible working over the past 16 years. I have been a lucky—I shouldn't even say 'lucky'—recipient of that and have managed to work part time for a number of years. I've also encouraged, where possible, my female—and male—employees to work flexibly. However, as Australians, we still have a long journey to travel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recommend the report. The report includes six substantial recommendations, starting with conducting a pay gap analysis, which has been undertaken. It then talks about introducing a robust, gender-neutral paid parental leave policy in order that both males and females can avail themselves of looking after young children and returning to the workplace. The report also talks about normalising flexible working arrangements. It particularly mentions that we often have a tendency in the workplace to say, 'She only works part-time,' or, 'He only works four days a week.' We need to remove the 'only' from that conversation and normalise flexible working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth recommendation is to rethink and redesign part-time roles for managers. Often it is very hard, in many industries, for managers to obtain part-time and flexible work. The report also recommends inclusive recruitment and promotion practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work is just beginning with this report, commissioned by the former coalition government, and all levels of government, business and the community need to work together collectively to narrow the gender pay gap. It is particularly important that the private sector works in partnership with the three levels of government in order to drive change, as the private sector remains the largest employer of Australian women. An investment in gender equality is beneficial to employers as much as employees, as it can attract and retain talent. This is particularly relevant in 2022. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  Before I was elected to this parliament, I had envisioned a career for myself researching and advocating for greater gender and cultural diversity in Australia's leadership, working on issues around the gender and ethnic pay gap. It was an interest sparked during my time working at the University of Sydney, where I met Professors Marian Baird and Rae Cooper and Dr Meraiah Foley. They spent years—decades—researching how we can improve the lives of working women. Professor Marian Baird was a leading figure pushing for the first paid parental leave scheme to be introduced in Australia. It was a scheme that I was able to access when I had my son in 2016. It meant I was able to stay home with him during those critical years of his development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professors Cooper and Baird established the Women, Work and Policy Research Group at the University of Sydney in 2006. Since then they, along with a group of extraordinary researchers and academics, have been at the forefront of research on women, work and policy in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. Much of their work has centred on the gender pay gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gender pay gap is currently 13.8 per cent, and it has hovered around that mark for the past four years. While the gap is trending down, it still results in women earning an average of $255 a week less than men. When you factor in part-time work, the gender pay gap for all employees widens to 30.6 per cent—or, in real terms, $483 a week less than men. The gap still impacts women across every industry in every occupation at every life stage. What is most concerning for me is that part of the reason the gap persists is our society's undervaluation and therefore underappreciation of those working in the care economy: teachers, early educators, aged-care workers and nurses. They are often women, and they are doing some of our most important work—looking after our kids, the elderly, and our sick. Yet, because these jobs have sometimes been viewed as 'women's work', we don't pay them nearly enough for the contribution they make to our society. What's more, on top of being undervalued and underpaid, these jobs are increasingly insecure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, I'm proud to say, is determined to continue to close this gender pay gap, and there are several mechanisms to do so, which the member for Jagajaga has submitted in this motion. The first is the establishment of an independent women's economic security task force. By making smart, targeted investments, such a task force will help promote women's economic security. The second is making gender pay equity a legislative object of the Fair Work Act. This amendment will require the Fair Work Commission to decide cases with gender pay equity in mind. Third, you can't fix what you can't see. So, transparency is essential for fixing the gender pay gap problem. The Labor government will require large companies to publish their gender pay gap data, allowing people to access pay-gap information online so that women everywhere can make an informed choice about the company they'd like to join.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth is backing a real pay rise for aged-care workers and similarly feminised workforces. Just as we backed a minimum wage increase, this government wants to back traditionally female industries in its efforts to secure higher wages and narrow that pay gap. For me, critical to narrowing the gender pay gap is the availability of good quality and affordable child care. The expert panel of the New South Wales Women's Economic Opportunities Review, chaired by Sam Mostyn AO, underscored the importance of high-quality, accessible child care in increasing women's participation and success in the workforce. The evidence is clear. The availability of affordable child care has a positive impact on women's employment through an increase in women's workforce participation and average weekly hours worked. By making early childhood education high quality, affordable and accessible, we set kids up with the best possible platform in life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to use this speech to pay tribute to the extraordinary women who have worked so hard to ensure my life as a working woman was made that little bit easier. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  This is an important motion. Gender pay equity is something that we really shouldn't still be talking about in 2022, but, sadly, we are. So I thank the member for Jagajaga for bringing forward this important motion. It is very disappointing that the most recent research from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency shows that the gender pay gap in Australia impacts women across every industry in every occupation at every age and life stage. The current overall national gender pay gap is 13.8 per cent. Women, on average, earn $255 less per week than men. Adding the part-time workforce, the gender pay gap for all employees widens to 30.6 per cent. The largest gaps are in professional, scientific and technical services, health care, and financial and insurance services—some of the biggest employment sectors in Warringah. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, the International Labour Organization observed that, globally, despite substantial progress in women's employment, there had not been any meaningful narrowing of the gender pay gap at work for the past 20 years. That is just outrageous. Globally, the gender pay gap is approximately 20 per cent. So, for every dollar earnt by a man, a woman would earn 80c. Gender pay gap contributes to long-term inequity and leads to the situation we have of women over 55 being the fastest growing group experiencing homelessness. Low wages drive low superannuation contribution. Time out of the workforce also stalls superannuation and career progression. So all these problems are interlinked, and it all starts with the gender pay gap. And, from there, the inequity continues and grows. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the gender pay gap also contributes to women being more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and other aspects. Seventy per cent of people living in conditions of poverty globally are women. Around the world, women have limited access to, and control of, environmental goods and services. They have negligible participation in decision-making, and they are not involved in the distribution of environmental management benefits. Consequently, women are less able to confront climate change—the very thing that impacts them so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A constituent who came to me with concern about gender pay disparity said she has suffered at one of the largest companies in the country. Her story is one of complex adversity, including surviving domestic violence and enduring mental health impacts. Her pay negotiations took place at a time where her circumstances were rapidly changing—escaping domestic violence while she was supporting her child as a single mother. None of this context or circumstance was taken into account by her employer. My constituent is in a management role. But, due to her employer's recent cost cutting, any career progression opportunities have been removed. She raised her concerns with management and was told she should have negotiated better. Her employer does release obligatory reports into company gender equality but actually then redacts the real figures and actually doesn't act upon what those reports show, which is that the gender pay inequity is there. Legislation to ensure companies are acting adequately on gender pay and equity disparity is urgently required, because giving it lip-service is simply not good enough anymore. So I welcome the commitment of the new government to improved gender pay equity, with budget investments, legislative change and change to care economy wages. But more work is needed, including improving paid parental leave policy to incentivise greater uptake by men and greater participation in unpaid care work by men. Australia has one of the least-generous paid parental leave schemes in the world. It is highly gendered and discriminatory, in considering only women's income in the calculation of eligibility. Perinatal discrimination is the top discrimination complaint in Australian workplaces. One in two mothers and one in four fathers report that they have experienced discrimination in the workplace in the lead-up to the birth of a child, according to the Australian Human Rights Commission. Improving childcare affordability and accessibility is long overdue. We talk of skills shortages and how small businesses are struggling to find the workforce they need, but we are not maximising the potential of the Australian population. We simply must address these gender equity issues.</span>

This is not a new phenomenon. Indeed, it's something we've reckoned with for a long time as a society. On this day in 1984, the Sex Discrimination Act came into force. That was the year that I finished year 12. Not enough has changed in the last 40 years. This is not something that is going to remedy itself of its own accord. It's a problem that is persistent, with consequences and harms that go well beyond the headline figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not simply that many women take home less income than their male counterparts, although that's an obvious injustice. The same pay for the same job is not the norm in this country. The gender pay gap reflects a deep and structural inequality. Women are paid less than men for the same jobs straight out of university or in base-level jobs. Men are more likely to be tapped for a promotion. Women are more likely to be penalised for their caring duties—a perfect storm of gender disadvantage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's more. It is perhaps more obvious in the way that we value and reward different types of work in this country. During the pandemic, we found out who our essential workers really are. They are our nurses, our aged-care workers, the retail workers who put up with people squabbling in supermarket aisles over essential items, our teachers and our childhood educators. I was lucky enough to spend some time with some dedicated childcare workers recently with the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Anne Aly, when she came to the Warradale Community Children's Centre at Parkholme. Some of these women had worked there a decade or more, dedicated to ensuring a positive experience and growth opportunities for the children involved in their care—our next generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing all of these industries have in common is that the essential work undertaken in them is predominantly done by women. The so-called feminised industries are renowned for low pay rates and insecure work. These workers are not rewarded in a way that recognises just how essential they are to the functioning of our society. What does it say about our community that those professions that look after our next generation, that are responsible for their education and growth, that look after us when we are sick or older or vulnerable or that are responsible for ensuring that we can get what we need to eat and survive, are so low paid? At the times that we as Australians are most dependent on the work of others for our wellbeing, those people are not financially valued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was so proud when the Albanese government advocated for a minimum wage rise in line with inflation, and it was delivered. Two point eight million people benefited from this. Sixty per cent of them were women. And it's why we will continue to fight to improve the wages and conditions of workers in these highly feminised industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the gender pay gap, the ramifications are sometimes hidden, but they're ongoing. We see this in the fact that older women are the fastest-growing group of people who are likely to experience homelessness. I've seen it countless times in my prior work: women getting to retirement, losing employment or experiencing a family breakdown and very rapidly finding themselves with no way to pay the rent or the mortgage—and I note that it's currently National Homelessness Week. This is often compounded by the fact that, as well as being lower paid, women are statistically more likely to work in casual, part-time or insecure employment. They too often have very low superannuation balances and little savings as a result of that lifelong gender pay inequity. That's why I'm proud to stand here as a member of the Albanese Labor government, which is truly committed to closing the gender pay gap—establishing an independent women's economic security task force to help inform budget investments in advancing economic equality, making gender pay equity an object of the Fair Work Act 2009, requiring large companies to publish their gender pay gaps, and backing a real pay rise for aged-care workers, who are overwhelmingly women, and looking to provide backing for similar industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's indefensible that in this day and age we shouldn't have the same pay for the same job, and an appropriate valuation of the so-called 'feminised workforces'. Labor is committed to eliminating the gender pay gap. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="297660" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I thank the honourable member for Jagajaga for bringing this chamber's attention to this important issue of gender pay equity. In my first speech, last week, I noted that the population of Kooyong boasts an above-average proportion of women—all of whom are above-average women—which means that the impacts of the gender pay gap are very keenly felt by my constituency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gender pay gap measures the overall inequity that women experience in each industry and across the national workforce. This set of figures is obviously based on a large amount of data, but it's also emblematic of the inequities and disadvantages faced by women, which are much harder to quantify. For instance, in 2022 women make up more than 50 per cent of our workforce but only 20 per cent of CEOs. This figure isn't particularly alarming because we're especially worried about CEOs—although we do want to see gender parity all the way to the top—but because it tells a bigger, more complex story that is way too familiar for working women. It's the story of gender-based discrimination in hiring, in promotions and in opportunities to progress within a company or a department. It's a story about women facing greater barriers to reach every level of seniority along the way to being a CEO. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of the gender-based discrimination in hiring and in opportunities for career progression is underpinned by the belief that female employees are burdened with caring and domestic labour outside of their professional work—to a far greater degree than male employers. And the reality is that they are. The most recent census found precisely what every census in the last 15 years has found, which is that women disproportionately shoulder the burden of domestic labour, with the average woman working up to 15 hours each week to keep the house running and its occupants cared for, and the average man putting in under five hours each week. It's no wonder that fewer women are climbing the leadership ladder and fewer women are present at CEO levels when many of us are effectively forced to work a second part-time job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women are hired below their proficiency and then promoted less frequently, due to gender bias and discrimination. What's more, once in the job they're paid less than their male counterparts across their industry and comparative industries. In the most recent financial year men earned, on average, $25,000 more than women. This extraordinary figure isn't an anomaly. Women work just as hard as men but earn significantly less than men every year of their working life. That yearly financial disadvantage accumulates over decades to create massive comparable deficits in savings at the time that women retire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just a lifetime of earning less than men that sets women up for greater hardship in retirement. Women tend to spend many years out of the paid workforce, working unpaid to raise the next generation, and during this period of their working lives they are of course not paid any superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kooyong is one of a handful of electorates with a superannuation gap. That is, the disparity in the superannuation held by men and women is more than 33 per cent. This means that the average retired woman in Kooyong has just two-thirds of the wealth that her male counterpart retires with, despite working just as hard for just as long. After a lifetime of earning less money, spending more time in unpaid domestic work and accruing less superannuation, it's no wonder that the largest and fastest-growing group of people facing homelessness are women aged more than 50. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I campaigned to represent Kooyong here in parliament, I was unequivocal that superannuation must be appended to maternity leave and to other care related leave as an essential step towards pay equity for women in retirement. Furthermore, our government needs to show leadership in its promotion of equality, respect and safety for women at home, in the workplace and in the community. Empowering women's workplace participation contributes not just to economic security and financial independence for each woman but also to the economic growth and prosperity of our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I echo the member for Jagajaga's sentiments that there remains significant work to do to end gender inequality, and I look forward to working collaboratively with members across the parliament in the coming years to achieve parity of income, wealth and financial security for women. </span>
