                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this age of identity politics we hear much about how we are identified by our gender, our age, our sexuality, our race, our ethnicity or our level of physical or intellectual ability. These are known as protected attributes, and they should be. We are rightly protected against discrimination in relation to any of these attributes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As human beings, we are also soul and spirit. We are also, importantly, what we believe. For many, this can inform who they are more than anything else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The protection of what we choose to believe in a free society is essential to our freedom.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is only right we should expect that what we sincerely believe should be afforded the same protection from discrimination in a free liberal democracy as any other protected attributes of our humanity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such protections respect the true integrity and dignity of the individual. It's what makes them who they are, who we are, and how we choose to live our lives in accordance with the laws of this land.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the product of a tolerant and mature society that understands the importance of faith and belief to a free society, while not seeking to impose those beliefs on or ever seeking to injure others in the expression of those beliefs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It balances, as Australia always must, freedom with responsibilities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also builds on Australia's proud record as the most successful multicultural and multi-faith nation on the planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To so many Australians, religion is inseparable from their culture. They are one and the same. To deny protection from discrimination for their religious beliefs is to tear at the very fabric of multiculturalism in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are the most successful multicultural country on the planet, united in our love of our country and the freedoms so many have come here to enjoy—particularly to escape discrimination and persecution for their religious beliefs. They came here seeking that freedom. That freedom should be protected for them. Those freedoms, those most important to them, should be protected from discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a free society, we don't go around imposing our views on each other or seeking to injure one another with those views.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People should not be cancelled or persecuted or vilified because their beliefs are different from someone else's in a free liberal democratic society such as Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole point of faith is choice—the action of free will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for this reason that free societies typically have a strong tradition of faith. Faith and freedom have been so inseparable in the formation of liberal democracies all around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is therefore no wonder that people of faith and religion have played such a prominent role in the creation and establishment of free societies. The underpinning principles of our free societies—indeed, the notion of liberty itself—draw heavily from the roots of faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Religion and faith are also about humility and vulnerability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are about love. They are about compassion. They are about speaking the truth in love, as the scriptures say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They recognise the sanctity and dignity of every single human being.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Faith is about the heart. It is about the soul and the spirit. It's not about the state or the marketplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our democracy we rightly divide church from state—that is an important liberty. But we do not separate faith from community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">History has shown that dictators and autocrats have never felt at ease with people of faith amongst their ranks in their societies. They have never felt at ease with faith and religion. They have never felt comfortable with human choice, with human dignity and the refusal of individuals to give to the state, what is the proper place of the divine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Intolerance towards faith and religion, is to see the life of faith as a threat to nation and liberty and often the state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In so many settings, faith strengthens lives. It provides that sense of belonging. It builds and sustains and nurtures communities.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so grateful for the contribution of countless Australians of faith—who have built schools, hospitals, food kitchens and shelters, and started services to meet almost every human need you can imagine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Religious communities have always sought to bridge the gaps of human need in our free society, between the state and the market place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need institutions like the Salvos, Jewish Care, Lifeline, Muslim Women Australia, Mission Australia, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, and countless others offering services large and small.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of them bring a vital human dimension to their work.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They attend to the needs of the soul and the spirit—not just the needs of our physical selves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To leave the fulfillment of such needs only to the government and the state or the market is to weaken our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the late Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks argued, the state can deliver much—health, welfare, education, defence, the rule of law. But I would agree with him when he argues that the state is not the author of the active citizenship that creates the face-to-face care and compassion that constitutes the good society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The capacity of the state or the market to meet the needs of our soul and spirit has great limitations, if any capacity at all. They can be incredibly impersonal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In between the state and the marketplace you will find the community, you will find family, you will find the individual—and there also you will find the work of faith and religion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The protection from discrimination of faith and religion in the public sphere is therefore central to the strength of our civil society and the health of communities, families and, indeed, our very selves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country is better because of the generosity and charity of our religious communities and institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about helping protect what we value as Australians: difference, fairness, choice, charity and, if we are not hurting others, the right to live our lives as we choose to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a protection from the few who seek to marginalise and coerce and silence people of faith because they do not share the same view of the world as them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is based on four years of work and is a longstanding commitment of our government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2017, the government appointed an Expert Panel into Religious Freedom chaired by the former father of this House, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, a fine attorney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expert panel received over 15,000 submissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It reported to the government in 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, the government took to the Australian people a commitment to introduce new protections against religious discrimination, consistent with other antidiscrimination laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, the government has been working through the issues with so many groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have consulted widely on this bill. And again I thank the Attorney-General for her role in leading this process, and her predecessor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is balanced and thoughtful. It does not take from the rights and freedoms of others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not seek to set one group of Australians against another, because to do so would diminish us all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It strengthens important freedoms that have been buffeted over recent years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill honours the mandate we have from the Australian people to protect Australians of faith and religion against discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about extending the umbrella of fairness that is so fundamental to our national character, because Australians strongly believe in fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to protect people of faith from discrimination on the basis of their religion in daily life, including work, education, buying goods and services and accessing accommodation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are some provisions in the existing laws that provide some protections for people of faith, these can be complex and can create uncertainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And they are inconsistent across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, there is a gap in New South Wales and South Australia, where there is either limited protection or no specific protection against religious discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will provide for the first time protections for those of faith at the Commonwealth level, and in the states of New South Wales and South Australia where there is currently no state based religious discrimination legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill brings clarity and it provides confidence that Australians of faith can have confidence they will be protected from discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Sikh should not be discriminated against because of the turban they wear.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor a Maronite because of the cross around their neck.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor a Muslim employee who keeps a prayer mat in the bottom drawer of their desk at work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor a Hindu couple who are seeking to rent a property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor the Jewish school seeking to employ someone of their faith—if that is their preference—and the publicly stated policy of the school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill ensures people can't be persecuted for moderately expressing a reasonable belief—what could be fairer than that?—whether that belief is motivated by—or indeed, critical of—a religion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It recognises the unique ways in which those of faith express their beliefs and ensures that good faith statements of that belief are appropriately protected for both religious and non-religious views.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the bill draws a clear line against harassment, vilification or intimidation of anyone. Religious faith should always be expressed in love.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about creating a bigger space for everyone in our national life—to be themselves, who they believe, what they believe, free of discrimination, coercion and judgment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is our Australian way, and it always has been so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill recognises that religious schools must be free to uphold the tenets of their faith and the ethos that makes their school a community. It is recognition of the sacrifices parents make to educate their children in accordance with their values and beliefs and the choices they have made for their children's education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As many schools have said throughout this process, 'faith is caught not taught'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill protects the fundamental right for religious schools to hire religious staff to maintain their religious ethos in accordance with a publicly available policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This protection will be able to override state or territory laws which seek to interfere with this right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The approach detailed in this bill provides certainty to school communities and to the staff they employ through the development of policies that are transparent to the school community. It's only fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing in this bill—I stress: nothing—allows for any form of discrimination against a student on the basis of sexuality or gender identity. You won't find anything of that nature in this bill. Such discrimination has no place in our education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The protections in this bill affirm the generous, openhearted and accepting culture that is embodied in much of our national life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we believe it is important that what has been treated as a culturally accepted norm should be better codified in law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, every age faces its share of bigotry against people of faith. The Treasurer and his colleagues sadly know too much about this in their own personal lives and in their own communities. I particularly acknowledge all those of the Jewish faith. It is a great shame that the Treasurer of our country has to be offered close personal protection not because he is the Treasurer but because he is a Jew.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The values of 'tolerance' and 'diversity' have been appropriated against Protestant Christians, Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Mormons, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Baha'is, Sikhs and so many more religions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Discrimination against people of faith is not a new thing; it is ancient.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sectarian divide that dominated almost the first two centuries of European settlement in Australia is testament to that. Catholics and Protestants. Thankfully now a thing of the past; we worship freely together and openly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, that sectarian divide is a reminder that people of faith too have a responsibility to treat others as they themselves seek to be treated—another great principle and teaching of faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Still, many people from various religious traditions are concerned about the lack of religious protection against the prevalence of cancel culture in Australian life. It's true. It's there. It's real.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The citizens of liberal democracies should never be fearful about what they believe, the lives they lead or the God they follow, if, indeed, they choose to follow one or acknowledge one at all.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

I wish to inform the House I did not. I said the path they were on was troubling. If there is concern over any misrepresentation that I did say that, then that's regrettable. Further, there have been false claims in the Senate, on the social media and elsewhere that I called for and/or incited violence. I did no such thing. I never did and never would.

It amends existing Commonwealth legislation to ensure that discrimination on the basis of religious belief or activity is treated in the same manner as discrimination under existing antidiscrimination law. It also contains a contingent amendment to clause 11 of the Religious Discrimination Bill to prescribe the Victorian Equal Opportunity Act 2010 only if the amendments to that act made by division 2 of part 2 of the Equal Opportunity (Religious Exceptions) Amendment Bill 2021 (Victoria) are enacted by the Victorian parliament and commence.</span>

Requiring complaints to go through conciliation prior to reaching the courts is a key measure in ensuring access to justice, and plays an educative role in enabling individuals and organisations to better understand their rights and responsibilities. Conciliation provides an important opportunity for the parties to a discrimination complaint to resolve matters amicably, without proceeding to litigation in the courts.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, improving the workability of the ministerial authorisation framework for the activities of the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation (AGO), the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS). This includes new emergency authorisation provisions that would allow these agencies to act immediately to assist Australians that are at imminent risk overseas—for example, where an Australian person was involved in a hostage situation or an ongoing terrorist or mass casualty attack. In these circumstances time is of the essence, and it is reasonable for Australians to expect the government to do everything in its power to assist them. The ability for our agencies to act quickly in such situations may determine the difference between life and death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces a counter-terrorism class ministerial authorisation to allow ASIS, ASD and AGO to expeditiously produce intelligence on one or more members of a class of Australian persons who are, or are likely to be, involved with a proscribed terrorist organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the bill will strengthen cooperation arrangements for our intelligence agencies. These changes include extending section 13B of the Intelligence Services Act to ASIS's onshore activities, thereby allowing ASIS to cooperate with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) both inside and outside Australia, subject to appropriate safeguards and oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces a number of provisions to clarify how AGO, ASD and ASIS may cooperate with authorities of other countries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, the bill will enhance and support existing intelligence agency powers.<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>This includes increasing the time for which the minister can order the suspension or temporary surrender of a person's Australian or foreign travel documents from 14 days to 28 days to allow ASIO the time it needs to complete a thorough threat assessment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other amendments being made to support our agencies include adding ASD into the Assumed Identities regime in the Crimes Act 1914, providing them with the ability to operate and use an assumed identity. The bill clarifies how persons can be approved to exercise authority under ASIO warrants, including new record-keeping requirements. The bill also extends existing immunity provisions provided to staff members and agents of ASIS and AGO for computer related offences in the Criminal Code for acts done outside Australia in the proper performance of those agencies' functions, to acts which inadvertently affect a computer or device located inside Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill will improve the transparency of agencies' privacy protections for Australians. This will include introducing a new legislated requirement that ASIS, AGO, ASD and the Defence Intelligence Organisation publish their privacy rules on their websites, clarifying the scope of ONI's privacy rules, and establishing a new role for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security by requiring it to review the privacy rules of those agencies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures I have outlined in the bill are designed to address or mitigate critical operational challenges faced by the National Intelligence Community. The bill implements the government response to thirteen comprehensive review recommendations, including four measures that both the comprehensive review and the 2017 independent intelligence review recommended. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It reflects the government's commitment to the continual improvement of Australia's robust national security laws, to ensure that Australians are kept safe and our way of life is protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A CCIV will be a new type of corporate structure for funds management, featuring an umbrella company with all its assets and liabilities segregated into 'sub-funds'. It is designed to be an alternative to the commonly used trust based managed investment scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The general objective for the CCIV is that the tax outcomes for an investor in a sub-fund of a CCIV align with the existing tax treatment for an investor in an attribution managed investment trust.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 to the bill extends by 12 months the temporary loss carry-back measure introduced by the government in the 2020-21 budget, allowing eligible companies to claim a loss carry-back tax offset in the 2022-23 income year.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government implemented temporary loss carry-back in 2020 to promote economic activity by providing enhanced cash-flow support to previously profitable companies that fell into a tax loss position as a result of COVID-19.</span>

Passage of these amendments will allow eligible companies to carry back tax losses from the 2022-23 income year. Tax refunds are limited to earlier taxed profits and the carry-back of losses cannot generate a franking account deficit.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 8 to the bill makes a number of amendments to Treasury portfolio legislation to ensure that Treasury laws operate as intended.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2018-19 budget, the government committed to introduce a Retirement Income Covenant to codify the longstanding expectations that trustees consider the retirement needs of their members. By requiring trustees to increase their focus on the retirement phase of superannuation, member outcomes will be improved while enabling choice and, ultimately, competition.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This schedule amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to require trustees of a superannuation fund to develop a retirement income strategy for their members. Trustees are expected to have a strategy formulated in writing, and a summary publicly available, from 1 July 2022. Trustees are not required to give effect to all the components of their strategies on 1 July 2022; implementation of the strategy is an ongoing process that is just required from that date.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The strategy will be a high-level governance document and will sit within the existing regulatory framework trustees should already know well. The retirement covenant is one step, therefore, in the government's reforms to better develop the retirement phase of superannuation. The covenant builds on existing reform and will kick-start improvements into the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian agricultural produce is rightly regarded as world class. A strong government-industry partnership is crucial to maintaining Australia's already high biosecurity status, protecting its food security and agricultural trade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the many ways this partnership is evident is through the work of Animal Health Australia and Plant Health Australia. Through these bodies, the Australian government works with state and territory governments and a host of dedicated animal and plant industries to further our biosecurity interests and ensure Australian produce remains in high demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The risk of exotic animal diseases and plant pests making their way to Australia is ever increasing. Incursions are relatively rare but have serious potential impacts. Acting swiftly to eradicate these exotic pests and diseases whenever possible avoids the significant cost to our producers of managing them if they establish here. This joint interest has seen governments and industry bodies partner as signatories to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement and Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last two years, government and industry, using these arrangements, were together able to eradicate citrus canker, Varroa mite (which is a bee parasite) and three strains of avian influenza. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry investment in biosecurity is most often funded through four kinds of biosecurity levies. These levies provide an equitable way for all producers to contribute to the cost of biosecurity activities and eradication responses that benefit their industry. Animal Health Australia and Plant Health Australia levies fund, for example, activities such as biosecurity education, planning and surveillance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Emergency Animal Disease Response and Emergency Plant Pest Response levies primarily fund industry contributions to eradication responses. They can also be spent on other biosecurity activities once these financial obligations are met. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An issue for PHA member industries is that for the EPPR levy this alternative use is limited to purposes related to emergency plant pests under the plant response deed. Increasing the flexibility in how these levies can be spent will increase their effectiveness. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will achieve this by broadening the range of permissible uses for these levies. Plant industries have welcomed this change, as it will allow them to focus available funds on their industry's most pressing biosecurity needs. However, meeting response costs remains crucial—it is the main purpose for emergency response levies—and the bill will not change that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just one way the bill will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of biosecurity levy funding arrangements. It will also modernise and streamline the AHA and PHA funding legislation, including by removing redundant or duplicative provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, a complex provision for funding biosecurity related research and development activities through PHA levies will be removed in favour of using PHA's more straightforward industry planning processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also simplify the process by which the relevant PHA industry member for a specific biosecurity levy is determined. This will reduce regulatory and administrative burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Honey bees provide valuable pollination services to a myriad of plant industries and the honey industry's biosecurity activities are now characterised as plant biosecurity. Therefore, references to honey in the AHA act can now be removed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also allow the AHA act to facilitate the key arrangements that are likely to be needed if other response deeds are agreed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes by the bill will each contribute to making the AHA and PHA funding acts more effective, efficient and fit for purpose. This will help maintain Australia's enviable position as a first-class agricultural producer and exporter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have waited too long for an integrity commission. I have watched scandal after scandal going uninvestigated with no independent watchdog on the beat. Each day that we delay is another day of deterioration of trust in this place and among the Australian people. Each day it becomes harder to claw back that trust. There are only four sitting days left this year. We may not be back again. This might be our very last chance.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If someone were serious about an integrity commission they would write a bill to set it up, they would table it and they would bring it on for debate. That's what I have done. The government has acted very differently, an endless merry-go-round of consultations, shutting down debate in the House and shutting down debate in the Senate. It's clear the government is ignoring the will of the people, and now it's obstructing the will of the parliament. It's broken the promise it made almost three long years ago. We are entitled to ask whether the Prime Minister honestly, in his heart, actually wants a robust federal integrity commission.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For almost two years now I've worked with members of the House and Senate to shape my integrity commission bill. I've also had very constructive discussions with countless other members in both houses. As an independent, my office door has been an open door. My bill is a true work of collaboration. It's a consensus approach with public hearings when in the public interest. It's retrospective and it allows for public referrals. Importantly, so importantly, it also protects against vexatious claims and allows for true exoneration. This bill is gold standard. But these are not my words; they are the words of the finest legal minds in the nation, from former justices of the High Court to leading academics, jurists and ethicists. They all support the passage of this bill right now. This is a bill of the people, from the people, to hold all of us to account, to help us to be our best selves. This is the integrity commission that our country deserves.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

I beseech you: do not remain silent. This is not about political pointscoring. This is not about partisan politics. This is about each and every one of us staying true to the people we represent. This is about each and every one of us doing the right thing on all sides of this House.</span>

I take the decision to stand here today very seriously. It's a difficult decision to make. This is one of the most important things that we come to this place to do. I think we should suspend the standing orders and have this debate. The time has gone on long enough.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone in this House, I think without exception, thinks that we need a robust federal integrity commission, that people should have trust and confidence in us, in the people that they elect, the people they send here. That's evidenced by the fact that there have been several bills presented to the House. All sides—the Greens, Labor, Liberal and the Independents—have said, 'We've got a bill.' But the problem is that the politics has wrapped it up so tightly that we're not progressing a bill. There's no debate about the fact that we need one, but we're not having the debate on what it should look like. We shouldn't be afraid to have the debate on what it looks like. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a place for politics. There's a place for the partisan pointscoring. But, on something as important as trust and confidence in elected officials—that's not it. We will never advance this if we can't find a way to come together to collaborate. A good starting point for that is the member for Indi's bill. She's put a lot of work into it. She has consulted widely. She has collaborated. Is it perfect? Maybe not. Why don't we talk about it? Why don't we all come here in good faith and have those conversations and find something that we can take forward in the best interests of all Australians? It's why we're here. It's why we come here. It's the most important thing we do. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I support everything that has been said in this place in relation to the urgency to suspend standing orders and allow debate on this very important legislation. The debate on this bill is urgent, and I commend everyone who is here to actually support this. It has been 1,077 days since the Prime Minister promised to introduce a Commonwealth integrity commission and yet we are still to see a bill tabled in the House other than the one that has been tabled by the member for Indi. There has also been tabled and passed the through the Senate a similar bill by the Greens. As Senator Lambie pointed out in the other place, a child born on the day the promise was made would have since learned to crawl, walk and talk. All the government has done on this issue is talk. We simply need to get on to the next stage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to support this bill, presented by the member for Indi, which I was very proud to second in this place last month. This is an issue that is raised with me continually by constituents of all political persuasions. They are united in wanting to have trust and faith in politics, in government. They want to know that there is a commission and a mechanism to ensure there are proper processes and that the issues are properly investigated. This bill has been awarded top marks by an independent review by the Centre for Public Integrity. In contrast, the draft model from the government has had issues. It has been broadly consulted on and it has been criticised. So, rather than just stifle debate and stop this, why not come forward, debate the bill from the member for Indi, move amendments, have the discussion and have a collaborative approach to an issue that will raise all of us? We will all be the better for it in our communities if constituents can have trust and faith in the process of government. If the Attorney-General won't back her own bill to bring it in after over a thousand days, then I think it is time that the member for Indi's bill be debated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An integrity commission with teeth will be able to investigate and put to bed so many of the issues that we've seen raised during this parliament, and it really is important that that be done. Many of the arguments that are raised are about, for example, some of the integrity commissions at state level. But that is misleading in terms of what this bill is. The bill from the member for Indi is the best of all the models. It is not a replica of one state's model versus another's. It is a collective of the best elements of all those models of integrity commission, and that's why it is important that we debate it. If the government has issues with elements of that bill, then it should move amendments, have the debate and discuss them. But 'nothing' cannot be the answer. We can't have the situation where we wait indefinitely and there is just nothing happening. Otherwise, we'll have allegations that sit out there and we'll just never get them resolved, whether they need to proceed to proper investigations or not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that a federal integrity commission be transparent. It is important that investigations with integrity are seen to be done by the public. They must be seen to be thorough. That is so important for the public to be able to have trust that government and processes are being held to account, because we in this place are spending the public's money. We pass laws. We are taking decisions that will impact on the lives of millions of people. We have a duty to ensure those decisions are for the greater good and are for the good of our communities. In that sense, the public must be able to be confident that those decisions are held to the highest standards and that there is a rigorous integrity and anticorruption process to catch any concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I commend to the government that it support this suspension of standing orders. We have had time throughout these last two years and the pandemic disruptions to debate a number of bills that couldn't, on any definition, have been described as urgent. Where there has been a will there has been a way to introduce legislation to deal with, I would argue, some issues that have never even been on the radar. But this issue, the biggest issue, the Australian people's trust in the Australian government's decisions, is one that has been left hanging. I think that has to stop, and we should debate it today.</span>

The bill that has been introduced is something that would be subject to parliamentary debate. It would be subject to inquiry and, no doubt, there would be amendments that would come through in its final form. But 1,000 days is too long. The best time to commence that debate would have been years ago. The next best time is now.</span>

I was here in the last parliament when the government said that they would introduce an integrity commission. It hasn't happened yet, and the Australian people have grown tired. They have grown frustrated with us. I would also like to acknowledge the member for Bass for having the courage of her convictions. She is on the right side of history with this.</span>

We have one more week to go this year. This is potentially the last sitting week before an election. Who knows? That is at the discretion of the Prime Minister, although many in the media say that this is our last sitting period before the election. We are failing the Australian people and we are failing ourselves if we do not even allow debate on a very good bill that sits before this parliament.</span>

I would urge government members, if you too have the courage of the member for Bass—and many of you have said quietly and privately to many of us on the crossbench that you do—why don't you put your actions where your words are and, when this goes to a vote, come and sit on the right side of history.</span>

There is a bill that has passed the Senate, pushed by the Greens, that is awaiting debate here. I think the opposition has a model. Others have alternative models. We should at least have the debate. We have time to have the debate. If the member for Indi's motion is supported, we could have a federal ICAC before Christmas and that would be a terrific way to end this parliamentary year.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I have been through the fiery furnace of the notorious Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland. I was one of the two people who called it on. We weren't aware of the extent of the corruption of the Police Force in Queensland, but we knew there were a number of murders. It turned out there were 42 murders. If we'd had an ICAC or a Criminal Justice Commission, as it was later called in Queensland, it would never have got to that stage. Twenty-one of those deaths were at the infamous Whiskey Au Go Go, in a fire started by the mobsters' cabaret protection racket. The club hadn't paid their protection money, and up went the Whiskey Au Go Go, with no inquiry or punishment of anyone. The door was closed from the outside and 21 people were killed. Quite apart from that, there were another 21 murders, six of them in North Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if you don't have something like this, you leave members of parliament—and I was one of those members in parliament—in very, very scary territory. You leave decent policemen in very scary territory. I would estimate that over 20 police had their lives completely destroyed by evil police putting obscene child pornography on their computers. To this very day, I am so scarred and scared that I still will not use a computer, because I saw what happened to all these innocent people during that inquiry. Judge Vasta, whose son is in this place and whose other son is a Federal Court judge, was hanged, drawn and quartered without a single scintilla of evidence ever being produced against him, because he was from the wrong side of the tracks. I am quoting from a speech by Lin Powell, who was touted as a future premier in Queensland. The sin of Vasta was that he wasn't a member of the legal club in Brisbane. He hadn't gone to the GPS/TAS schools. He was a canecutter's son from North Queensland. Those were the sins. The people that they put to judge him, the judges in Brisbane, were the very people who resented him being there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I've given you two or three examples of the terrible downside of a proposal of this type, but the alternative to that is to watch what happened in Queensland, where, if you tried to assail them, they assailed you long before you got close to them. That's why I'm backing an independent body such as is proposed by the honourable member, who, like me, represents a regional area in this place. That's why I'm backing her rather courageous and wonderful initiative today. But I ask everyone please to be conscious of the downside to these sorts of inquiries.</span>

The issue does not go to the merits of or the need for a serious and well-considered body to deal with the risk of serious criminal corruption at the Commonwealth level, because I want to be very clear that the government has developed such a model: the Commonwealth Integrity Commission, which is intended to be the lead body in Australia's successful multiagency anticorruption framework. We've gone through a very detailed consultation process—333 written submissions received, 46 consultation meetings and round tables—and we stand ready to introduce that legislation. We've done the detailed work. We've committed almost $150 million of funding to the Commonwealth Integrity Commission. We project it will have around 172 staff. And we've already implemented phase 1 of our plans by expanding the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a couple of things clear, because there have been some misleading claims made about the government's proposal. In the model we are proposing, the Commonwealth Integrity Commission will be able to investigate past conduct and matters that occurred prior to its commencement. The Integrity Commission will be able to look into past conduct that falls within the scope of its jurisdiction. This will include over 145 criminal offences that presently exist in legislation, including, for example, under the Criminal Code Act, under the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act and under the Public Interest Disclosure Act. The government will also, under our proposal, create new offences relating to corrupt conduct, including concealing corruption and repeated public sector corruption.</span>

The normal practice in this House, as I understand it, is for you to declare the vote as you have, Mr Speaker, but to note at that point that, given an absolute majority had not been achieved, the motion moved by the honourable member does not carry.</span>

What the Leader of the House has referred to is a process where the count is announced and a statement is then made, but what the Speaker has done is declared the outcome. Therefore, if the Leader of the House wants to dissent from that decision, that's an option before the House.</span>

I'm sure there's at least some shred of genuineness to it, but the reality is that it is within your prerogative, Mr Speaker. I know that there's advice from the Clerk, but I put it to you that it's within your prerogative under the standing orders to clarify the situation and to, in my respectful suggestion to you, adhere to that practice which would see a statement along the lines that I outlined earlier.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Party has used this position of leverage to get both the money on the table and the legislation on the table to fix the problems. That is what the National Party does. We are few in number but we managed to extract a deal and I sit here today with my colleagues proud of what we have achieved.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members may be wondering when this statement was made and by whom. It was made on 14 September 2005 during the second reading debate on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill by the now Deputy Prime Minister. This was the last step in the then Senator Barnaby Joyce selling out to the Liberals and agreeing to the privatisation of Telstra as a vertically integrated monopoly—a process which began in 1996.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a bad day for competition policy, a dark day for infrastructure investment and an afront to common sense. It is arguably one of the most counterproductive pieces of communications legislation passed by this parliament to give effect to one of the most flawed public policy decisions since Federation. It was a day when we were told that the regulatory obligations imposed on Telstra would serve the public interest and deliver the services and infrastructure investment that Australia needed. As we now know, those assurances from the then Senator Barnaby Joyce turned out to be non-existent. Telstra is no longer a vertically integrated monopoly, because after a decade of dithering by the coalition the Labor Party structurally separated it, and we did so in the national interest and in the name of competition policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill currently before the House arises from Telstra as a private entity seeking to restructure its business to better align the management and operation of its assets within its T22 strategy. This time, the restructuring is one that Telstra is pursuing of its own accord rather than in response to government. Telstra has publicly stated its plan to restructure the company into separate legal entities. These entities include the Telstra Group, InfraCo, TowerCo and ServeCo. These entities will hold different classes of assets and operate at different layers of the network stack.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Telstra does not require Government approval to undertake the restructure. However, without legislative and regulatory change, a range of key obligations that currently apply to Telstra would become ineffective or cease to apply to the successor entities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As such, my understanding is that this bill primarily seeks to address three key issues that arise from Telstra's proposed restructure. Firstly, to repoint Telstra-specific obligations that would otherwise cease to apply to new Telstra entities to the entities in the Telstra Group. Secondly, to introduce a ministerial directions power that enables the minister of the day to direct the demerged Telstra entities to fulfil their existing regulatory obligations or assist in the delivery of the obligations of another Telstra entity. This can include cooperation between entities to fulfil regulatory obligations or to uphold obligations in the NBN Telstra definitive agreements. Thirdly, the bill has been drafted to ensure the integrity of the facilities access framework is upheld and that restructuring does not inadvertently move assets outside the scope of the regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the explanatory memorandum of the bill states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill has been developed on the principle of regulatory equivalence—that is, the regulatory obligations that currently fall on Telstra should also fall on the entities in the new corporate group in roughly the same way. While Telstra is free to restructure its business as it sees fit, successive Parliaments have placed and maintained a range of obligations on that business, and it is important that these remain effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an appropriate principle which Labor supports. However, I interpret this to mean equivalence not just in a purely technical or legalistic sense but in a practical sense too. That is the lens we have applied to the bill. Based on briefings I have received from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications and from Telstra, I am satisfied that the proposed measures in the bill give effect to regulatory equivalence and, in circumstances where unforeseen issues could arise, the bill affords the minister the necessary direction-making powers to deal with them. There has clearly been a lot of technical consideration put into this bill, and I want to thank those who provided briefings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the proposed authorisation provisions would extend the existing authorisations to Telstra's successor companies so that the agreements or conduct continue to not contravene the anticompetition provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. This authorisation would only apply to agreements with the sole purpose of extending existing obligations to successor companies and to authorise conduct to give effect to such agreements. I understand that both NBN Co and Telstra are not satisfied with the tight drafting of this section of the bill, specifically the sole-purpose test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate committee report noted that the department advised it is considering amendments to authorisation provisions to 'provide appropriate limited additional flexibility'. No amendment appears to have been forthcoming in the House. It is a matter for government as to whether they wish to reconsider amendments in the Senate on this particular matter. It should also be noted that Telstra has been proactive in identifying employment related issues and bringing them to the attention of policymakers. Separate instruments in the Senate will deal with the grandfathering of employment benefits for Telstra employees and, based on my consultations with the unions representing these workers, I am satisfied those issues are being adequately dealt with. As such, Labor will support the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talk about the structure of Telstra and its regulatory obligations conjures up many memories. You would be hard pressed to find a group of people more unqualified on broadband, technology and telecommunications competition policy than the Liberal-National coalition. You cannot trust them to manage public money, you cannot trust them with competition policy and you certainly can't trust them on technology. Those opposite do not believe in engineering and economics; they only believe in politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just rewind a little and look at how this all began. In the mid-1990s, the Liberal-National government began the process to privatise Telstra as a vertically integrated monopoly. The now minister for communications was one of the original architects of that flawed policy. This damaged competition. It degraded customer service. It starved the regions of much-needed investment. But apparently this was all acceptable because then Senator Joyce had extracted a deal that would address all the problems. Well, how did that deal work out? What problems did that deal solve? What long-term outcomes did that deal achieve? By any objective measure, it was a total failure. The deal extracted nothing of enduring significance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the Liberals and Nationals were then forced to develop broadband policy after policy to try and address the problems they had created. True to form, those policies, if they could even be called that, got worse and more bizarre on every attempt. Labor's decision to establish the National Broadband Network was a direct response to the failed Liberal-National privatisation of Telstra. True to form, the Liberals tried to wreck the NBN too. They criticised the satellite option, they abandoned fibre, they attacked universal wholesale pricing and they misled the country with the 2013 strategic review. History now records that not only did they get each major decision wrong but they were wilfully dishonest through the entire process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all their endless talk and meandering lectures, neither Mr Turnbull nor Minister Fletcher understood the construction side economics of the NBN. Critically, they never understood the cashflow implications of the technology choices governments made either. It doesn't matter if you wear grey suits and if you wave your finger around when talking, and I assure you it doesn't matter if you write mini books about the history of the internet. What matters is the quality of your decisions, your ability to bet the big calls right and your ability to conduct yourself in an honest manner through the course of the public policy debate. If you can't do that, which hasn't been done, then in public policy terms you are as useless as a chocolate teapot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government abandoned fibre and backed a second-rate copper NBN on the basis that it would cost $29.5 billion. That cost first increased to $41 billion. Then it increased to $49 billion. Then it increased to $51 billion. And now it has cost $57 billion. This was truly, if there ever was one, a masterclass in incompetence and technological mismanagement. The abandonment of fibre was never about cost; it was always about the politics. One side, Labor, went with a particular technology, and the other side, the Liberals, felt compelled to oppose it. Every time the multitechnology mix had a cost increase, which was many, many times, the minister and his predecessors would concoct a new set of untruths about the original fibre plan for the NBN to try and distract the media from their failures. This fundamentally dishonest scam, conducted over seven years, was decimated on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> in February this year. Consider this: the minister said the multitechnology mix 'would be delivered five years faster than the original plan and would save taxpayers $30 billion'. Then he claimed:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We committed to a turnaround—with the NBN to be rolled out four years more quickly and for $30 billion less than under Labor's plan …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very notable that the minister has been unwilling to repeat his claims ever since they were comprehensively debunked. That in itself is an admission the minister wasn't misinformed but knew he was misleading all the time. He is a diminished figure as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite recently, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> also reported figures which the government has fought to keep secret for seven years indicating that the fibre-to-the-node and HFC rollouts have been between 2½ and three times more expensive than originally assumed in the strategic review. The Liberals claimed that HFC technology would be a game changer. Well, it was, but for all the wrong reasons. The HFC experiment has descended into the most expensive deployment of its sort in the world and the most unreliable. The government was forced to abandon the Optus HFC network because it wasn't even fit for purpose. NBN Co then had to halt the HFC rollout on the Telstra infrastructure, because switching on a vacuum cleaner was enough to cause the internet to drop out through noise ingress. And since that time NBN Co has sunk almost a further billion dollars into it, because the HFC architect didn't have enough capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, we have the copper network. We were told the copper network would deliver minimum speeds to all Australians by 2016. That was the promise. Well, it's nearly 2022, and fibre to the node is still not delivering basic minimum speeds of up to 25 megabits per second for up to 200,000 premises across Australia. NBN Co can't even tell the Senate when this basic minimum requirement, which actually happens to be set out in law and in their own Statement of Expectations, will actually be delivered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What was even more amusing, even before the government had completed the NBN rollout, was the minister had been forced to backflip into a fibre overbuild because NBN is worried about the impact of 5G. Consider that, just for a moment: imagine spending $50 billion on a second-rate network, launching tirade after tirade against fibre, and then crawling back to the very thing you had been arguing against all those years. This is not simply a vindication of sound Labor policy but an affirmation of something more fundamental: the Liberals get the big calls wrong, and Australians suffer every time they do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID has demonstrated that reliable, quality high-speed internet is not a luxury or a 'nice-to-have'; it is essential 21st century economic infrastructure. Families need reliable fast connections for school and work. Small businesses and entrepreneurs need it to stay competitive. Regional communities need it for all those reasons and as a matter of safety. As it stands, Australia is today ranked 59th in the world for average broadband speeds and is ranked 32 out of 37 nations in the OECD. This is just not good enough, and it has all happened under the Liberals' watch. Australia deserves a government that sees and uses technology as a tool for social and economic transformation, and that is what Labor will deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, just last week, the Labor leader and I announced that, if elected, a Labor government will keep the NBN in public ownership for the foreseeable future and expand fibre access for up to an additional 1½ million homes and small businesses. There is a technology repair job that needs to get done, and public ownership provides NBN Co with the certainty to do that job. We will invest $2.4 billion to boost fibre access in each state and territory, ensuring over 10 million premises across Australia—that's 90 per cent of the fixed-line footprint—have access to gigabit speeds by 2025. This investment, consistent with the accounting treatment of NBN Co, will be funded through a combination of Commonwealth loans, free cash flows and equity, if determined appropriate. The optimal financing mix in capital structure will be determined in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy will run fibre into the street and give Australians who rely on copper wire connections now the choice of having fibre connected to their home. If they want those faster speeds, then their NBN copper can deliver. Owners of these properties, who are mainly in the outer suburbs of our cities and in regional areas, were short-changed by the coalition when it took an axe to Labor's original fibre design. It is estimated that up to 660,000 premises will be in the regions benefitting from this plan and 840,000 in the suburbs. Fundamentally, this is about expanding the much-needed technology repair job that's already underway. At the end point of this, 7½ million Australian households and businesses will be on a full fibre connection or have access to a full fibre connection if they require fast speeds, and nearly seven in eight premises in the fibre-to-the-node footprint will have fibre access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a plan that is focused on the future and seeking to make the future a more equitable and better one. Labor believes that the next decade should be one where Australia makes things here again, becoming globally competitive in industries such as advanced manufacturing. A key element of our A Future Made in Australia plan is a reliable, high-speed national broadband network to allow Australia to seize the digital industrial opportunities before us. I therefore support the bill.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—The presentation of this report fulfils one of the committee's key statutory oversight responsibilities found in subclause 29(1)(a) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001, namely to review the administration and expenditure, including the financial statements of the six intelligence agencies in Australia: the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO; the Office of National Intelligence, ONI; the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS; the Australian Signals Directorate, ASD; the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation, AGO; and the Defence Intelligence Organisation, DIO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This oversight role of the committee is carried out in circumstances where the transparency and public accountability of the intelligence agencies must be balanced with the need to protect national security. The committee is privy to detailed, largely classified information about the administration and expenditure of agencies. Much of the evidence received by the committee, both written and in hearings, must remain confidential due to its classified nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has only a limited role in these reviews in advising what level of resources is appropriate for each agency to protect Australians from risks to national security. Similarly, the committee has no role in determining what the national security priorities should be, nor how those priorities may be met within existing resources. The committee also has no role in reviewing particular operations conducted by agencies, sources of information available to agencies, aspects of the activities of agencies that do not effect Australian persons or individual complaints about the activities of the agencies. Rather, the committee has the responsibility to analyse the evidence put before it and report to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the Australian community on the administrative arrangements and expenditures of each agency, and any changes to these activities that may affect an agency's ability to continue to meet its objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike previous admin and expenditure review reports, this report covers two reporting periods—2018-19 and 2019-20. These periods constitute reviews No. 18 and No. 19. The committee commenced review No. 18 in December 2019. Submissions were received from the relevant agencies and classified hearings were to be held in late February 2020. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic most parliamentary and committee proceedings were delayed, and in June 2020 the committee resolved that the review would be finalised and considered in conjunction with review No. 19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee commenced review No. 19 in September 2020. Submissions were sought and received from the six intelligence agencies, the Auditor-General of Australia and the IGIS. In addition to the normal administration and expenditure information provided by agencies, the committee requested the agencies provide extra commentary on a number of focus areas, including: the impact of COVID-19 on the agencies' admin and expenditure; recruitment and retention processes; the implications of a constantly evolving threat environment; and the health of the agencies' cybersecurity. The committee found that the six security organisations have managed their admin and expenditure appropriately in a period of significant operational pressure not only from the COVID-19 pandemic but also from the evolving technological operating environment, as well as the continued maturation and reform of the national intelligence community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has made four recommendations for the government to consider as a result of these reviews. Two of these recommendations relate to the provision of support services to staff. One recommendation goes to mechanisms to address ongoing issues which these agencies face, with persistent and repeated requests for information from certain parties. The fourth recommendation goes to the government to consider resourcing the Office of National Intelligence to conduct an enterprise-wide review of lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I thank all the agencies for the way in which they engaged with the committee. I also thank and acknowledge the secretariat, who provide incredible service and advice to the committee. As a relatively new member of this committee, I acknowledge the current chair, Senator Paterson, and the previous chair, the now Assistant Minister for Defence. I also acknowledge the current deputy chair, Senator McAllister, and the previous deputy chair, the member for Holt.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ZIMMERMAN:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—The report is quite a weighty tome. Over the past 18 months, many Australians have observed with awe and admiration the incredible work of medical scientists in finding vaccines and new treatments to a virus that has taken so many lives or impacted the health of millions of people around the world. Many of the innovations and medical understandings developed during the COVID-19 pandemic will have long-term benefits for health treatments for other conditions beyond COVID-19. These innovations reflect the new frontier of medicine, which is giving many hope for better treatments and technologies for conditions ranging from cancers to rare diseases. At its forefront is the development of personalised, or precision, medicine, which is being delivered as our understanding of fields like genomics grows. This report examines the opportunities to deliver better health care for Australians through our regulatory and health technology assessment process for both medicines and technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has long prided itself on having one of the world's best health systems. By any measure, we do. However, no nation and no health system can rest on its laurels. With innovation happening at a fast pace, governments at both the state and federal level have a duty to ensure that Australians continue to have access quickly to medicines and medical technologies and that our health systems facilitate that outcome rather than hinder it. Medical innovation has grown exponentially in recent years, and pharmaceutical and medtech companies are eager to bring new medicines and devices to market as efficiently as possible. The committee heard from clinical experts and patient groups and their families, who urged us to support a more flexible system to provide for timely access to the latest medicines, devices and treatments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the challenges facing the existing system is the trend towards delivering precision medicine to patients. Precision medicine is an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variabilities in genes, environment and lifestyle for each and every person. This offers great hope for patients with a broad spectrum of conditions and diseases, including patients with rare diseases. However, these developments were not envisaged when the current regulatory and reimbursement system was designed and legislated many years ago. The committee recommends the creation of a centre for precision medicine and rare disease within the Department of Health to provide advice on research priorities, education and training for clinicians and patients and the development of a comprehensive horizon scanning unit for new medicines and novel medical technologies. The committee also recommends that a new pathway for cell and gene therapy be established to simplify the health technology assessment processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard from patients and their families about the need for more patient involvement in the approvals decision-making process for new drugs and novel medical technologies. Patients do have a crucial perspective on what treatments work best for them, including important lifestyle benefits, but this has traditionally not been given enough attention within the regulatory system. The committee recommends reforms that will strengthen the central role that patients should have in that assessment process. The committee heard that patients and clinicians were frustrated that some medicines and technologies are available overseas but not yet in Australia, with companies seemingly deciding not to sell their products in Australia for commercial reasons. This is a particular issue that arises for orphan drugs and drugs for rare diseases. The committee therefore recommends changes to encourage companies to enter the Australian market with their products and technologies. This includes changes to the fee structure for applications to the health technology process, particularly for orphan drugs and smaller companies, including Australian startups. The approval processes for new medicines and novel medical technologies are very complex, and this report discusses different ways to streamline them to provide better and faster patient access to treatments. One example of this is the Life Saving Drugs Program for treatments for very rare diseases, which, despite urgent patient need, currently requires a lengthy two-step application process. The committee recommends this process be streamlined into a one-step process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clinical trials are another area where Australia has considerably strong comparative advantages. However, the committee has recommended changes to streamline the system even further to ensure Australia is an attractive location for clinical trials. This includes the immediate harmonisation of ethics and governance approvals into one online platform and the establishment of a national registry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was clear to the committee that there was a great deal of momentum behind the push to improve the regulatory and reimbursement system—not just a general desire for change but a wealth of ideas for reform and a willingness to make the efforts and compromises necessary to implement them. The committee hopes that this report catches those ideas and paves the way for the improvements needed to provide Australians with the best possible health care now and into the future. I have only touched on a few of our recommendations today. There are many more that I hope the government considers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank everyone who took the time to give evidence to this inquiry—most particularly, all the patients and their families. Their testimony was often moving and exceptionally persuasive. I also want to thank my fellow committee members for their close engagement and their knowledgeable contributions to this inquiry. The health committee is an outstanding committee, and the level of cooperation amongst all its members has been superb. I particularly want to thank my deputy chair, Dr Mike Freelander MP, for his expertise, good judgement and good humour, often at the butt end of my jokes. I also want to particularly acknowledge the role of the two supplementary members that we had for this inquiry, who brought their own expertise: the member for Higgins and the member for Dobell. Finally, I want to thank our committee secretariat staff, particularly Kate Portus, Rebecca Gordon and Peter Richardson. They have supported our work with exceptional dedication and quality, and occasionally some patience and forbearance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new frontier of medicine and technology is an exciting one for the health care we provide as a nation. Acting now to build on our obvious strengths in health will have enduring benefits for all Australians, for this generation and future generations to come. I commend this report to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  by leave—First of all, I just want to dispel any question about why the chair and I wanted to have this committee investigation. It's not to expedite treatments for male pattern baldness, okay?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to echo the words of the chair. I often talk about bipartisanship in this place, and this committee was really an exemplar of how bipartisanship can deliver wonderful outcomes. I commend the member for North Sydney for his chairmanship and for the report. We worked all together, and I'm very grateful for his support and encouragement during the entire inquiry process. I'd also like to thank the other members of the committee—the member for Makin, who's here with me today; the supplementary members, the member for Dobell and the member for Higgins; and the member for Oxley—all of whom made terrific contributions, as did our other members, the member for Reid and the member for Moncrieff. I thank them all for their efforts and, in particular, as I said, I want to thank the chair for his exemplary report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really would like to add a few comments of a personal nature on the report. I know it's not going to please everyone, but I think that the efforts that the committee members put in, and the secretariat of Rebecca Gordon, Kate Portus, Tamara Palmer, Peter Richardson and Rei-Gaylene Oroki, were absolutely wonderful. The report would not be as good as it is—and I think it is really good—without the efforts of everyone, particularly the secretariat, and they really do deserve recognition for their work. It has made me realise how much we rely on the Public Service and public servants to make sure our democracy works. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll have much to say in the coming days about this inquiry and our report, but, briefly, I think the most important thing that's come out of our report is the importance of patient centred care and the importance of a cooperative and collaborative approach to health care in the 21st century. I started my training as a doctor almost 50 years ago now, and we've made tremendous progress since then. But in the last 10 years it's become apparent that our science has progressed to the point where our individualised care for a whole range of illnesses, ranging from cancers through to neuromuscular disorders, is based on genetics and genomics and we will have individualised treatment for most of the disorders that we see in health care in the future. Our system, which was designed 20, 30 or 40 years ago, needs to be updated so that we can cope with this tsunami of genetic and genomic treatments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I hope to see the end of oncology in terms of chemotherapy. We will have genetically targeted treatments for most cancers in the future, so that we'll be able to do away with the side effects of chemotherapy and people will get individualised biologic treatments that will cure their cancers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own field of paediatrics, we are now seeing the arrival of genomic treatments for a whole range of neuromuscular disorders. People have mentioned in this House before, spinal muscular atrophy, for which there are now one-off genetic treatments available which appear to be curative. We are looking at evolving genetic treatments for fatal disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. I met a family from the member for Lalor's seat who had three boys affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and unfortunately one of them passed away. This is a disorder that, in my paediatric life, I hope to see a cure be available for. That would be a wonderful, wonderful thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now at a real tipping point in medicine. This has been a wonderful report. The individual recommendations, of which there are over 30, are very, very important. But the importance now lays in us being able to make sure that whoever is in government takes these recommendations on board, develops them, funds them and has them as a basis of our modern health care in Australia. I certainly hope that I will be in the Labor government that does this. I look forward to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Save Our Sons Duchenne Foundation, the spinal muscular atrophy groups, the metabolic disorder groups, the mitochondrial disorder groups and all the patient groups who presented to the committee and gave us their time without fail. I found it incredibly humbling to hear those stories, and I know that every other member of the committee felt the same. We felt absolutely privileged that people had let us into their lives. I know the members for Higgins, North Sydney and Makin felt that too: that we were given the privilege of getting the insights that they had into their own disorders. Part of our report will be trying to get those voices to our healthcare providers very early on in the approval process for new treatments—and that's what we want. All of us want that. This report did not have any political bias at all, and I'm very proud of that, as I know the chair and the other members are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to also thank the industry groups: the MTAA, Medicines Australia and all the industry groups that presented to us. They did it in a feeling of camaraderie and of goodwill, with the best outcomes for Australian patients at the forefront. I also feel really thankful to John Skerritt, the TGA, PBAC and MSAC for the time and the supports that they gave us in providing information to us. It made me very proud of our Australian healthcare public servants and the service they give to this country. I think that became apparent across the course of our inquiry. There's no doubt that they will be well supported by whoever is in government, if the chair and I have anything to do with it in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report provides a very clear path forward. I'm grateful for all the support that we were given by the parliament and by our parliamentary staff but, in particular, by every member that sat on the committee, no matter what their politics are. It's my hope that future governments will develop their health policies in line with our report. I commend the report to the House, and I thank you for the indulgence of being able to speak on the reburkeport today.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—As the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade resides in the other place and the chair of the Defence Subcommittee has ascended to the chair of this place, the duty falls to me as deputy chair of the main committee and the subcommittee for defence to present this report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry into the Department of Defence annual report 2019-20</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 March 2020, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade resolved to have the Defence Subcommittee inquire into and report on the Department of Defence annual report 2019-20. The inquiry initially focused on four main aspects of the annual report, namely: space based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; cyberwarfare; defence estate in the north and north-west of Australia; and defence workforce. Throughout the conduct of the inquiry, defence science and technology and strategic fuel security became additional focus areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The global geostrategic environment is changing at a rate and on a scale much greater than was anticipated towards the end of the last decade. Military modernisation in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in grey zone capabilities and tactics, has added a layer of complexity to Australia's strategic challenges, which must be met in an equally high-paced and agile manner if we are to maintain a credible defensive deterrent. Never has it been more apparent that future threats to our national interests and those of our allies and partners could come in various unconventional forms. These include information warfare, political warfare, cyberattack, space and antispace capabilities, economic coercion, disaster and climate change diplomacy, and other forms of influence and coercion that fall below the threshold of conventional military responses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While initial focus areas of this inquiry into the Department of Defence annual report 2019-20<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>were relatively narrow, what the committee subsequently learned was significantly broader. The committee sees the clear potential advantages of taking an increasingly asymmetric approach to national security in coming decades, not only within the Defence organisation but from a broader whole-of-nation perspective. This extends beyond strictly military capabilities to shared civil military space capabilities, joint civil military cybercapabilities and innovative approaches to future fuel and energy security measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a sovereign nation, Australia has many defence related choices over the coming decade. We can continue to focus on defence philosophy, primarily on conventional military responses whilst developing asymmetric and grey zone capabilities as adjunct or niche considerations, or we can more actively embrace asymmetric and grey zone capabilities as equals to our outstanding, indispensable, yet relatively small conventional military forces. We must also begin to think unconventionally about energy security, as Australia's strategic focus has shifted from the Northern Hemisphere to regions closer to home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our traditional assumptions about logistics chains that provide for our peacetime fuel needs in our region must also be challenged and, if necessary, our national approach altered to ensure we have access to fuels and potentially alternative fuels in times of crisis. Alternatively, Australia, as a medium power with a burgeoning science, technology, engineering and mathematics sector and a long history of technical and military innovation, is superbly positioned to become a world leader in unconventional, asymmetric and innovative approaches to many aspects of our national power, including defence and energy security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the time is right for Australia to play to its strengths. Despite our relatively small population and modest economy compared to the major powers in our region, our Defence Organisation has the opportunity to become an increasingly potent adversary, an agile adversary which would pose a very difficult strategic calculus for any potential future threats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report makes six recommendations. These relate to the increasing size of the Australian Defence Force, improving Australia's grey-zone capabilities and improving national fuel security. These recommendations seek to alter Australia's national strategy to make us more resilient, agile and capable, particularly as a sovereign nation in the age of grey-zone tactics and warfare information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Defence Subcommittee, I express my sincere thanks to the many representatives of the ADF who have performed so incredibly, particularly in the last two years, where they have stepped out of more military based roles into assisting our communities with COVID. I also want to thank other government agencies, industry and academia, who really made extraordinary contributions to this inquiry. The Defence Subcommittee was enlightened by much of the evidence submitted and was very encouraged by the highly professional and dedicated people from all sectors who contributed, who take our national security very seriously and take the stability and peace of our region equally seriously. I would also like to thank the secretariat, ably led by Julia Morris, and also I would like to thank Wing Commander Steven Ferguson, our Defence adviser, who has had the difficulty of a pandemic added to that of an already complex and busy committee. I commend the report to the House.</span>

That is not done lightly by our side of politics. That is a decision made sparingly in Labor Party party rooms, and I will talk a little bit about that. But the remarks I make are delivered as an individual MP rather than as the shadow minister for health and ageing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is appropriately named Maeve's Law, after Maeve Hood, who the minister, in a very fine speech to the parliament eight months ago, informed us was a young girl, then five years of age—she might be six now—living in his electorate down in Victoria with mitochondrial disease. It's a reminder that, for all of the technical and ethical issues that this bill raises for members, ultimately these pieces of legislation are about people. They're about patients. In this case, they're about very young children and their parents, grandparents and wider families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, having said that, I note that as members of parliament we must also grapple with the fact that this bill raises a number of issues that, in many ways, are age-old in health care: the collision between discovery or technology in health care on the one hand and ethical and faith based beliefs that members of the broader community, as well as members of this parliament, hold on the other. As I say, this is not a new tension. It sometimes manifests, it would appear, as more than a tension; it manifests as a bona fide collision. This is not new. This is age-old. But we have to recognise, as the member for North Sydney and the member for Macarthur reminded us in their remarks in relation to a very important Reps inquiry report delivered today, we lived through a period of turbocharged discovery as we harnessed the benefits of big data: information technology systems that are being harnessed by the healthcare system and by researchers across Australia and the world; and new discoveries, particularly in the fields of genomics and others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we come to this debate, all of us recognise that this raises very sensitive issues. We are dealing with a disease that too often is fatal for very young members of our community, causing enormous grief and real suffering to their families, as we'd all understand. But it also does raise some very, very deeply held, serious ethical and faith based beliefs by many members of our community and many members of this place. In particular, the legislation impacted by this bill, the Research Involving Human Embryos Act and the Prohibition of Human Cloning Act, are both pieces of legislation passed in 2002, as Deputy Speaker Andrews would recall, being a member of the Howard government at the time. This bill involves three issues that raise particular ethical considerations for the parliament: the potential creation of embryos for purposes other than procreation or pregnancy, although I will come to the debate around that question; the destruction of an embryo, and questions around human cloning—I use that term in a technical sense as it is defined in the Prohibition of Human Cloning Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, all of those questions have been debated in this parliament before. Deputy Speaker, you're probably the only one in the chamber right now who was involved in those debates in 2002 and 2006. They have been very broadly canvassed in the community as quite pronounced examples of that collision I talked about between this extraordinary period of discovery that we live in on the one hand, and long-held and deeply-held ethical and faith based beliefs on the other hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial disease is an incredibly serious genetic disorder which is often fatal for very, very young children. Somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 Australians will develop severe mitochondrial disease during their life time. We're told that, on average, one baby is born every week with severe mitochondrial disease, and most of those babies will die within the first five years of their life. Mitochondrial disease is caused by a defect in the mitochondrial DNA of the baby, which is a type of DNA passed on only through the mother—that is, passed on through the egg cells rather than the sperm cells.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, mitochondrial DNA is very distinct from nuclear DNA, which makes up the overwhelming bulk, as much is 99.9 per cent, of a person's DNA. It is the nuclear DNA which determines what we would understand to be the person's unique characteristics: their look, their personality and so on and so forth. On the other hand, mitochondrial DNA, which constitutes around 0.1 per cent, one-thousandth, of a person's DNA, is essentially responsible for converting food and oxygen into energy, which is why it's described in the literature and common parlance as the 'battery pack' of the human. That's a very important distinction between mitochondrial DNA on the one hand, which is incredibly important but a very small part of the person's DNA, and, on the other hand, nuclear DNA, which goes to make up what we understand to be the unique characteristics of a human.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal which is canvassed within the essentially regulatory framework that's proposed by this bill is a process that is used as part of assisted reproductive technology, or IVF or ART as we've come to know it in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two techniques that are under consideration across the world and, relevantly, in Australia to be canvassed by this bill. There are two techniques under consideration to use a donor's mitochondrial DNA to replace the mother's mitochondrial DNA, because, as I said, ultimately it is the passing on of the mother's mitochondrial DNA, if that is defective, that causes mitochondrial disease in the baby. Both of these techniques use the donor's egg, which is not particularly novel—a well-known technology—and the donor's mitochondrial DNA. The donor's nuclear DNA—that is, all of the DNA that goes to make up what we'd understand to be the unique characteristics of the donor as a person; their appearance, their personality, their intellect and so on—is removed from the egg and it is replaced by the nuclear DNA of the mother. So all of those characteristics that we would understand to be inherited from our mothers all come from, all flow from, the nuclear DNA. And that nuclear DNA from the mother is inserted into the donor's egg along with the battery pack, along with the mitochondrial DNA. That is a very important distinction—between the nuclear DNA and the mitochondrial DNA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two techniques to undertake this combination of a donor's mitochondrial DNA and the mother's nuclear DNA. Importantly, for our country—because our country has been looking to the example of the United Kingdom—both of those techniques are licensed in the United Kingdom and have been since 2015, and are both canvassed by this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is known as maternal spindle transfer. The important distinction involved in this technique compared to the one I'll come to in a second is that the transfer of the nuclear DNA from the mother into the donor egg happens before the fertilisation of the egg. It happens before the donor's egg is fertilised by the father's sperm. This technique, it must be said, although it's proposed to be canvassed or licensed ultimately by this bill if the bill passes, is much less developed than the second technique I'll come to. It does involve transfer before fertilisation of the egg, which has an important distinction for many who will bring their ethical framework to the consideration of this bill. But it must be said it is a far more technically difficult technique and therefore far less developed, and, we should be honest and say, far less likely to be utilised in this country. It's certainly proving to be far less likely to be utilised in the United Kingdom, which is some years ahead of us in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second technique is known as pronuclear transfer, and that is the more advanced technique and the technique which, we must be honest, is more likely to be used here if this bill passes and if what is proposed in the bill becomes reality. It involves both eggs—both the donor's egg and the mother's egg—being fertilised, and it is after fertilisation that the process I outlined earlier takes place. So the mother's nuclear DNA is removed from her fertilised egg and inserted into the donor's fertilised egg, which has had its pronuclear DNA removed. So the important distinction again, as people think about their views on this bill, is that the pronuclear transfer happens after the fertilisation of the egg. The mother's fertilised egg is then destroyed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, for some, it must be said, that involves the creation and the destruction of an embryo. There are different views in the community about the point at which a fertilised egg becomes an embryo, as many members here will understand. Some church and other faith based organisations and their members and adherents hold the view that an embryo is formed at the point of fertilisation. They are genuinely held beliefs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2002 forms of the legislation that is proposed to be amended by this bill—the 2002 definition of an embryo—were that an embryo comes into being at the appearance of the two pronuclei, so effectively very soon after the fertilisation. In 2005 the Howard government commissioned a review of this legislation, which resulted in the Lockhart report, which was then implemented through 2006 amendments to this legislation. One of the recommendations of the Lockhart review was to amend the definition of 'embryo' and essentially push that definition further down the development pathway, if you like. The submissions from the research community in particular were that the definition of 'embryo' in the original legislation in 2002 was too restrictive. They made submissions, which were ultimately accepted by Lockhart and implemented by this parliament, to change the definition of 'embryo' to the following: 'an embryo is created at the first mitotic division, when fertilisation is complete', which is essentially the process of cleavage, some two or three days after the combination of the sperm and the egg. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do make the point—I think it's important I make it, given the position I hold in the Labor Party, at least—that, on my reading of the 2006 amendments to the legislation, both the pronuclear transfer and certainly the maternal spindle transfer probably do not involve activity undertaken at the point of an embryo. But I recognise that different members of this parliament, certainly different members of the community, hold other views about when an embryo ultimately is created. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill being debated right now, and we hope over coming days and next week in the other place, perhaps, is a long time coming. I don't make that point critically; I make it to reinforce that this has been the product of quite substantial consideration by constituent parts of this parliament but also out there in the community. In 2018 an important Senate committee report was delivered, and I'm only familiar with the Labor senators involved, but I acknowledge the involvement of Senator Keneally, Senator Pratt and Senator Watt in particular as members of that inquiry; others played a role as well. That was a very important process to hear from stakeholders, families, researchers and the like. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019 and 2020, at the direction of the government, the NHMRC undertook a very exhaustive consultation process around that, essentially leveraging off the report undertaken by the Senate. In 2019 and 2020 there was substantial engagement by the minister, and I thank him for it, with my predecessor, the member for McMahon. Ultimately, in the early part of this year, on 2 February, the minister released a consultation paper, which was open for about six weeks, indicating the government's broad intent in this area, seeking submissions around that broad intent. On 24 March the minister, as I said, in a very fine speech, introduced this bill to the parliament. This is more than eight months ago. This is the first opportunity we have had to debate the bill since then. In the intervening period, the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee held an inquiry, which reported in August. Given that both major parties have decided this would be decided by a conscience vote, no recommendations around the substance of the bill were contained in that report, but I think the report is a valuable consolidation of the different views and the different submissions that were made to that Senate inquiry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in the intervening period—and I will come to this in some more detail, because it relates to some amendments that the government has only released in the last hour or so—the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee made a report, which, as I said, I will deal with in a little more detail later. As I said, the government proposal largely replicates the United Kingdom framework 2015, which is broadly recognised around the world as the leading framework in this area. It proposes what I describe, and I think the minister agrees, as a slow, staged approach to this question. And it allows, as I said, both of those techniques—the maternal spindle transfer technique and the pronuclear transfer technique—to be researched and ultimately perhaps developed in this country. It will involve a regime of licensing by the existing NHMRC Embryo Research Licensing Committee, which was established by the 2002 legislation and which has been operating ever since, for almost two decades. The first stage, which the minister describes as stage 1A, would involve one clinic in the country being identified and licensed to undertake research and training in this area. That research and training would be directed at refining techniques and protocols that might be implemented more broadly in the community. The second stage, stage 1B, would involve a clinical licence being delivered to that clinic to allow mitochondrial donation to be undertaken with approved families. Again, that will be overseen by the NHMRC Embryo Research Licensing Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I emphasise that these two stages involve quite an extensive period of time. The limited research and clinical practice in those two stages might take as much as 10 to 12 years to be developed to the point where I think this parliament would be comfortable with an expansion to broader clinical practice beyond that single clinic. Obviously, the states will also be required to opt into this scheme. Initially, that probably only involves one state, given the nature of the clinic being licensed. But that's important, given that ART, or assisted reproductive technology, is also substantially governed by state laws. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there are a number of legal and ethical issues beyond the broadly medical or technological issues that are canvassed by this bill. It is unclear, at a legal level at least, whether this does involve the creation of an embryo as defined by the legislation after the Lockhart review research, and, ultimately, the destruction of that embryo. But it is quite clear that for many in the community—and, I'm sure, for some in this parliament—an embryo is created and ultimately destroyed, within their personal understanding of an embryo. What is clear, though, to me—and, I imagine, to everyone in this parliament—is that the provisions of the prohibition against human cloning in research act are activated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Deputy Speaker Andrews will be very familiar with, that act contains a prohibition against the creation of an embryo that contains genetic material from more than two people—more than just what we would typically understand to be the mother and the father. There are also a number of legal changes, which I will come to. On this last point, the fact is that if you have mitochondrial DNA and the egg from a donor, the nuclear DNA from the actual mother and , obviously, the father's sperm, it involves three parents. The media often uses this term of a 'third parent' or a 'three-parent family'. I have to say I reject that label as fundamentally inconsistent with a whole range of other technologies that are undertaken in medicine. For example, organ donation introduces much more third-party genetic material than this proposed technique does. But, ultimately, I reject it because I think it's stigmatising and not helpful to a proper legal and ethical understanding and debate about this. There are also legal issues around the donor, particularly around the donor's relationship with the child. These are not new issues, and as the bill canvasses and the minister has said, they would likely be dealt with in the same way in which we deal with sperm and egg donors in the context of the Family Law Act and so on and so forth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this will be dealt with on the Labor Party side, and, I understand, on the government side as well, as a conscience vote. That is consistent with the way in which the Labor Party has treated issues around embryo research since the national executive back in 2002, of which I was a member at the time, considered how to deal with the original legislation on research involving human embryos and human cloning. A decision was taken by the executive that this would be dealt with as a conscience vote by the Labor Party, and that is how we will deal with it on this occasion as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My view about this legislation is that it is well designed and it balances the extraordinary potential these emerging technologies have to improve medical practice and the quality of life for a number of Australian families, while recognising the ethical issues that are posed for many Australians and the need to tread carefully through this in a slow and staged way. The Lockhart review was an important review of this legislation after several years of operation. It involved some legislative change. In 2010, when I was the minister with responsibility for the NHMRC, I commissioned a further review of this legislation, which reported in 2011 and recommended no substantial change to the regime, particularly the role of the NHMRC Embryo Research Licensing Committee. This is an appropriately cautious and staged approach, overseen by a licensing committee that has demonstrated its value and its capability over almost two decades now. It flows from deep consideration over several years and draws, as I said, on the experience of our friends in the United Kingdom, who have been dealing with this for several more years than we have here in Australia. There is a big way to go yet in developing the protocols, the techniques and the understanding of this research, but it does provide real hope to many families across Australia. I indicate I will be voting in favour of this bill. I recognise these issues are not easy for many members of the community, including many members of this parliament, but I'm convinced this legislation is worthy of our support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my closing remarks, I want to pay tribute to a few people. The first is the minister, who made a very fine speech introducing this bill and who has brought his experience, his substantial intellect and his humanity to this process. He is to be credited for that. The previous shadow minister for health, the member for Ballarat, and the current shadow minister for health, the member for McMahon, worked with the minister very closely and constructively; I want to pay credit to them as well. MPs in this House have also been engaged and, even though they may come to this legislation with different ethical beliefs about the operation of it, have participated in the debate in good faith and very constructively in a way that reflects the way in which this legislation was debated all the way back to the time of the Howard government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were many researchers, many commissions, many community members and many faith leaders who also participated in this process either in the policy debate or in clinical practice and research. They have put their views forthrightly, respectfully and constructively. I want to thank them. Most importantly, I want to thank the mito community—the parents, grandparents and young children who are living with these devastating diseases. I recognise they are difficult conditions to respond to as a parliament and a medical community. They have been ably led by the Mito Foundation, and I want to thank them for their bravery, their fortitude and their compassion. I commend the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude my remarks, can I say a few words about amendments that have been released—I think we received them about an hour and a half ago from the government. I haven't had a chance to consult on them. As I said, I'm not speaking as the shadow minister for health; I'm speaking as an individual MP. All members will need to look at these amendments. They flow from a Scrutiny of Bills Committee report that was delivered in April. At that time, the minister wrote in reply to the report, indicating that he did not think there was a need for any amendments to the bill. That view has changed in the last 24 hours, it would appear. I think it's a pity that these amendments are being brought to the parliament so late in the day, given the very deliberative and constructive way in which this bill has been developed. I can say at first blush that these amendments look and sound like the sorts of amendments that I individually would be willing to support. But I need to indicate that we've only received them in the last hour and a half and that the debate is underway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very unique type of debate in the sense that the usual party processes don't operate. Every individual MP in this place is making a decision on this legislation according to their own views on the bill and their own conscience. So I make the point that I think it is a pity that this has happened so late in the day. It is going to be difficult to make sure that these amendments are circulated to all members who ultimately are going to have to vote as individuals in this debate perhaps early next week. But I have indicated to my colleagues that, having had a chance to look through these amendments, for what it's worth—and it may not be worth much—I would be willing to support those amendments. But I reinforce that that is only a comment that I make as an individual MP rather than on behalf of my party. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="102376" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MADELEINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:10</span>):  The minister noted that the government committed to deliver this annual statement in 2013, and I thank the minister today for making this statement to the House in 2021. Members may remember that last year's ministerial statement on investment was given by the former minister, Senator Birmingham, at an awards night dinner for exporters hosted by his own agencies. What a treat for those award winners—a half-hour, self-congratulatory speech from the minister! The 2019 so-called annual investment statement is, of course, nowhere to be found. This is emblematic of this government's basic instincts of spin over substance, announceable over action, photo-op over follow-up. Instead of subjecting the government's record to the accountability of parliament, the former minister gave a self-indulgent speech at his own party. So I'm very glad, and welcome the fact, that the government has brought the annual investment statement back to the parliament after this two-year absence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia benefits from an internationally competitive and open economy. While the discourse tends to centre on trade, international delegations, growing export market and free trade agreements—investment, the other pillar of economic strength and resilience upon which the Australian economy balances, is, at times, overlooked. And, in the moments when it is not overlooked, foreign investment is weaponised by populist politicians seeking to inject fear of foreign investment into the community. In truth, Australia has depended on foreign investment for its development since British settlement. Since that time, foreign investment has changed and grown. Of the approximately $4 trillion invested in Australia, which includes passive portfolio investment, most is from the United States; the United Kingdom; Belgium, acting for the EU; followed by Japan. Of the $4 trillion total, around $1 trillion, as the minister noted, is foreign direct investment. So foreign direct investment makes up around 25 per cent of all incoming foreign investment to this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first regulation of foreign investment in Australia emerged in 1972. The catalyst was a curious food product present in bain-maries at roadhouses around the country. The Chiko Roll was sold in the tens of millions per annum when the US company IT&amp;T sought to buy the Aussie company. The idea of Americans buying out an Australian food icon led to an immense public backlash. The controversy reached this parliament—well, it was down the hill then—and it has been noted that the cabinet meeting over the Chiko Roll was the beginning of the regulation of foreign investment in Australia. I thank my colleague the member for Fenner for reminding me of this curious fact, and I do recommend his work on openness, which sets out a very good case for an Australian society and economy that is open to the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sale of Australian brands remains controversial. Some might recall the public discourse, verging on an Armageddon event, when Vegemite was sold to a foreign company. But often this is the only way to save a business. The question is: would we rather lose the product entirely or have it be saved and have the investment to reinvent that product? We see the story of RM Williams, created in 1932 and owned since 2013 by the luxury brand the LVMH group. It has now been returned to Australian ownership. It's a great story. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foreign investment creates opportunities and it creates jobs for Australians in Australia. Think of resources companies like Rio Tinto and BHP and how many people they employ. Both iron ore giants are three-quarters foreign owned and they engage 45,000 and 22,000 employees and contractors respectively. The resources industry is more broadly central to the history of foreign investment in Australia. In April 1985, Bob Hawke stood alongside Chinese Communist Party boss Hu Yaobang atop an iron-rich hill in the Pilbara and commenced a new era of Sino-Australian economic relations. Hawke's ambition that day was for China and Australia to invest jointly in an iron ore mine, a prospect he'd raised with Premier Zhao Ziyang in Beijing a year earlier. Prime Minister Hawke's active involvement paved the way for the signing of the Channar joint venture agreement between Rio Tinto and Sinosteel in 1987. This was China's first major overseas investment. More than 250 million tonnes of iron ore have since been shipped to China, creating thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in export revenue for Australia. In 2020, China's foreign investment in Australia totalled over $70,000 million. That accounts for two per cent of foreign investment and is our ninth-largest source of such investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The US and the UK remain the biggest foreign investors in this country. Another significant contributor of foreign direct investment is our regional neighbour Japan. Japan has been one of Australia's largest trade and investment partners for more than 60 years, and this is a testament to the strong ties that bind our two countries together. Japan helped build Australia's LNG industry. LNG requires big outlays, even compared to iron ore production. Shell and BHP in joint venture partnership with Woodside had to pay $3 billion upfront to start developing the North West Shelf due to the complex system of drilling offshore, processing offshore and liquefying for export.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the Whitlam government approved LNG exports in the 1970s, the Western Australian government secured Japanese capital investment via long-term sale contracts to build a gas pipeline from Dampier to Perth. The pipeline covers more than 1,597 kilometres, starting from the Burrup Peninsula in the state's north-west and finishing near Bunbury in the state's south-west. This allowed for the remainder to be sold off to power other projects in the Pilbara. The Dampier to Bunbury pipeline still plays a central role in WA's economy, bringing natural gas from the Pilbara to electricity generation plants near the population centres in the south. It's a remarkable achievement. The first LNG cargo from the North West Shelf arrived in Tokyo in 1989. LNG cargoes continue out of Karratha to this day, and, more recently, the Japanese company INPEX established the Ichthys project off the coast of Western Australia and in Darwin with an investment of $40 billion. With this, Australia has become the destination for Japan's largest ever overseas investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Such a strong history of investment in this country should cause us all to ask: where to next? The minister's statement takes us through what everyone else is doing in relation to critical minerals and rare earths. But what is the government doing to try and supercharge this future-facing industry? There are a few policies there, but I'd argue it's not terribly much, and it's definitely not enough. There is much said about establishing a lithium battery industry in this country, but, as yet, we haven't seen a government effort to attract investment from the battery-producing powerhouses of Japan and South Korea to build Australia's capacity beyond basic processing of lithium, nickel and rare earths. The truth is that, under this government, business investment is going backwards. Investment is down over 20 per cent since the Liberals came to office in 2013. Investment is at its lowest level since the 1990s recession, and this was before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic cannot always continue to be an excuse for underperformance. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments, over eight long years, have simply not provided the right investment conditions to support the economy across key areas like manufacturing, energy and resources, the care economy, and research and development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, the greatest threat to critical foreign investment is this government's lacklustre, lazy and frankly irresponsible approach to policy to address the true challenge of climate change. The minister set out some efforts, but I think this is too little, too late. Foreign investment funds are openly warning that they are considering cutting billions of dollars of investments into Australia because of this government's half-hearted commitment to a 2050 net zero emissions target. The Investor Group on Climate Change, which includes AustralianSuper—the nation's biggest super fund and among the top 20 in the world—UniSuper and Lendlease, released an analysis last month confirming climate policy uncertainty was a turn-off to international investors. Australia has become among the least attractive destinations for institutional investment in clean energy for industries of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a damning indictment of this Liberal-National government. It has failed to put forward any believable policies, and the result is that erstwhile international investors in Australian industry turn away and look elsewhere. The deputy governor of the Reserve Bank Guy Debelle recently warned of climate risks in the Australian financial system. He made the very obvious point, which this government likes to ignore:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Investors will adjust their portfolios in response to climate risks. Governments in other jurisdictions are implementing net zero policies. Both of these are effectively increasing the cost of emissions-intensive activities in Australia. So, irrespective of whether we think these adjustments are appropriate or fair, they are happening and we need to take account of that. The material risk is that these forces are going to intensify from here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">(Extension of time granted)</span> I'll reflect briefly on our own investment super powerhouse, the superannuation savings of all Australian workers. It's a remarkable thing that just a few months ago assets under management in the Australian super system reached $3.4 trillion. Through every worker in Australia and their super contributions to this extraordinary pool of savings, it is now the fourth largest in the world. Every worker in this country has contributed to Australia becoming a true investment super power on the world stage. The investment capacity of this nation has a role to play in securing the infrastructure and economic development of the Indo-Pacific, investing in regional neighbours while supporting Australia's national interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is indeed a virtuous circle: the investment of Aussie super into the economies of our neighbours builds a prosperous and peaceful neighbourhood, which in turn provides excellent opportunities for Australian exporters. In fact, Australian superannuation capital is on the path to join iron ore, natural gas and amazing red wine as a famous national export. Like foreign investment here, our own investments around the world are a sensible means to create jobs, raise living standards, increase prosperity and ensure peace across the region. Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  I'm pleased to rise in support of this bill, the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021. I recognise at the outset that it is a conscience vote, so these views are my own and I have every respect for those, who'll speak after me and consequently vote, whose own experience and own views may lead them to form a different conclusion than my own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I approached this from the angle of thinking that there is nothing more terrifying than being an expectant parent, closely followed by every day as a parent after that, and every expectant parent wants a happy, healthy baby. Sadly, for many parents, the joy of the birth of their child is accompanied with a range of emotions when that child is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, and one child every week is born in Australia with a severe form of this insidious disease, mitochondrial disease. So it's very important to me that I get the chance to speak on this bill, and I'm pleased to say that I will be supporting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the rate of those who carry the predisposition that makes them vulnerable to some form of mitochondrial disease is quite common; it sits at about one in 200. Breakthroughs in medical technology have come up with a way to prevent this from being passed on, which would prevent babies being born with this life-threatening disease. At least 60 Australian babies born each year suffer from severe and life-threatening forms of mitochondrial disease that could be prevented by using the mother's and father's nuclear DNA and replacing the mother's mitochondria DNA with healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor egg. I understand there are many sensitivities for some when speaking of the science of IVF and DNA, and I greatly appreciate their perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I can't talk with personal experience of the disease, I can talk with personal experience of the IVF journey. It was very controversial when it started, too. It was a young science, and it had a lot of growing up to do through its successes and failures, but it has helped so many couples along the way, given so many hope when they felt hopeless and brought so many loved and adored children into the world who would not be here without it. I would like to think that I would have been on the right side of history in having voted for its introduction in the way that I'm being given the opportunity to vote for this legislation today. I'm grateful for those scientists and lawmakers who persevered to see IVF become a reality and know in my heart that future healthy children and, just as importantly, their relieved parents, will be grateful we took this first legislative step on mitochondrial treatments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to understand that this procedure is targeted only at mitochondria. It does not alter personal characteristics or traits, as these are derived from nuclear material. The mitochondrial cells only contain genes essential for normal mitochondrial function. It has been reported in some circles as three-person IVF or cloning, which has stimulated some stigma around donation. We are not talking about three parents. We are talking about replacing the mother's mitochondrial cells with cells that are not predisposed to the disease. We're not talking about choosing eye colour or personality traits. We're talking about giving parents the chance for healthy children. We're talking about preventing passing on this disease and saving families and lives from devastating suffering. Legalising mitochondrial donation would allow impacted Australians to have genetically related children without the risk of them inheriting this very difficult disease that drastically limits their lives.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't believe this bill or this science is what its critics say it is. It is not playing God. It is not cloning. It is not designer babies. If it were those things, I would not be supporting it either. I'm not a person who believes just because science can do something that we automatically should. I also have my own deeply held faith that guides my moral compass. But my reading of the bill leads me to reject these criticisms. My faith leads me to believe not that everything is out of our hands or that we are passive observers while a higher plan plays out around us but rather that God gave us the knowledge, the tools and the perseverance to help ourselves and to be purposeful in relieving the suffering of others, as we have the chance to do in this case. Given my experience not just of struggling to start a family or of IVF but of doing this job, listening to all the horror stories of young lives filled with suffering or cut short for meaningless reasons and being powerless to do anything to help, I am pleased to have the opportunity to do something now. In this case, it's to help people, to help kids, and I'm pleased to support the legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a little girl by the name of Maeve who lends her name to this bill. She's five years old, and she wants to give people hugs all the time. I haven't had the opportunity to meet her, but I have watched her mum and dad's video about why this legislation is so important to them, and I want to pay tribute to their perseverance for what they are doing and also for the work that they have done on behalf of other families and other little kids who are persevering and have the resilience of Maeve, to ensure that they have a future against this disease. I'd also like to pay tribute to Minister Greg Hunt and to all of those other MPs who have played a role in reviewing this legislation over time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will ensure that this medical procedure is extensively researched and will be appropriately regulated going forward, including stage 1, which will guarantee over ten years of research and training including a specific clinic with an oversight committee to deliver mitochondrial DNA donation to impacted Australian couples. Clinical staff will be specially trained in the field prior to delivering care.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've said, the Prime Minister has, appropriately, for our party, made this a conscience vote. This is my first conscience vote in this place, and I'm proud to make this choice to support this bill. I respect, as I said, all those whose conscience and experience lead them to vote against it. But, for me, this is deeply important in exercising this right to save lives. It's why I fought so hard to get into this place—so that I could help parents and kids and help make their lives a little better. I certainly commend the bill. Enabling this research to go forward will enable, I hope, many parents in the future to make better medical choices for their families so that they can enjoy the wonders of a happy, healthy family. I know that Maeve would be proud of the efforts of her parents and would be proud of lending her name to this bill, and I'm very pleased to commend it to the House.</span>

Women and children fleeing violence are being turned away from shelters across our nation. They are resorting to sleeping in their cars, sleeping on friends' sofas or, worst of all, returning to danger.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It used to take an average of just three weeks to find someone a secure home. Now it can take two years. That is an indictment. Women and children fleeing domestic violence should always have access to safe refuge, advice and guidance. When the world feels upended, they should have something to hold on to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why a Labor government will fund an extra 500 community workers to help those fleeing domestic and family violence. As I and my colleagues announced yesterday, we will also create a new family, domestic and sexual violence commissioner to act as a strong voice for victims-survivors.</span>

I'm pleased to say that last Friday the King Tide Brewpub, Coffs Harbour's first-ever pub brewery, swung its doors open. Founder and beer enthusiast Josh King was obviously born with beer in his blood. He worked in Sydney as a young student engineer at Tooheys Brewery, but Josh had a desire to move his family back to his home town of Coffs Harbour. Since then, both Josh and Lucy King have worked tirelessly to convert the old mechanic shed in Studio Lane into something really special. They designed the entire venue around their functioning brewery, bringing people into the brewery experience. It has an open-plan beer garden, as you would expect; a warm winter nook; a comfy kitchen mezzanine; and, the most important thing, 12 King Tide beers on tap, with names like 'The Power of Voodoo', 'The Hippie Camper', 'Virgin Haze' and 'Beached As'. I'm keen to try them all—perhaps not in the one session, though!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Josh and Lucy, I can only imagine the nerves, blood, sweat and tears you went through during this time. It's a testament to your vision and grit. You're on a winner. I can't wait to see your investment in the Coffs coast community pay off in spades. Cheers to you both.</span>

Mohammad is the father of five young children. He was a long-time employee and manager of World Vision in Gaza at the time of his arrest in June 2016. His work colleagues state that Mohammad had been assiduously non-political. He is accused of diverting $50 million of aid money to Hamas. Several independent reputable audits, including, I understand, an Australian DFAT investigation, found no evidence to support that accusation. His arrest, detention and court appearances to date have been described as shambolic and lacking transparency. His trial is secretive and held behind closed doors. His lawyers do not have access to relevant prosecution documents.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a friend of Israel. World Vision is a reputable global Christian aid organisation. World Vision, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and others have all called for Mohammad's release. I call on the Australian government to stand up for human rights and to call on the Israeli government to release Mohammad El Halabi or, at the very least, ensure that he has a fair, transparent and early trial.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Last Friday I had the pleasure of representing the Australian government at Lake Cargelligo, in my electorate, to announce $9.8 million towards a $20 million project to produce hydrogen from solar energy. It's a partnership between Graphite Energy, Toshiba International and MGA Thermal that will further progress the work that Graphite Energy have been doing over the last decade in Lake Cargelligo where they can transfer energy from the sun, using the medium of graphite, to generate steam for the production ultimately, hopefully, of hydrogen. They are small, individual modular containers that will produce hydrogen on site as it's needed. Hydrogen is a very difficult gas to transport around, so to be able to produce hydrogen onsite is a great advantage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is happening in regional Australia. It's happening in a small country town. Once again, it shows that regional Australia is leading the way when it comes to the innovation that's required to reduce emissions and help make our environment a more healthy place. Lake Cargelligo already has a very substantial industrial part of their town, with cutting-edge technologies and modern factories. This is going to add to the work that's being done and help bring Australia to a cleaner future.</span>

I was privileged to have him mark my honours thesis, and I know firsthand how his passion for teaching transformed lives. Professor Macintyre had a distinguished academic career: twice dean of arts at the University of Melbourne and the Ernest Scott chair in history, amongst many other appointments. Janet McCalman AC, another great Australian historian, writes of him as 'a history warrior who worked for a better Australia', who understood and explained our winners and our losers and:</span>

He was of course a longstanding member of the Brunswick branch of the Australian Labor Party and a valued, critical contributor to wider societal debates, in particular on the issue of civics education. We have too few great public intellectuals, as Professor Macintyre was, and, while we have many great historians, for me Stuart Macintyre stands along Manning Clark as having enlarged our sense of ourselves and suggesting who we might be.</span>

Honesty is the lesson of 2021—that being, that if you lie you just admit to it, fess up and apologise. Don't 'Milligan' around for months with the moral hazard of knowing that, certainly with public broadcasting, the taxpayer will fund your intransigence and your delays.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the experience in 2021, but there is no basis in law whatsoever that is available that the national broadcaster should have colluded with a staff member to defend defamatory material in the public domain, but they did. They passed up the opportunity of a completely cost-free apology and then vaporised around $170,000 on court costs at the taxpayers' expense. We need to accept that it's aggravating that you have to complain about ABC conduct to the ABC News unit first and then to another part of the ABC, but you can never go to ACMA. If we've learnt anything from the last 12 months, it's that the egos and entitlement of some in the Australian media need to be curtailed. We need a public broadcasting ombudsman. I commend Senators Abetz, Antic, Henderson and McGrath for standing up for these matters in the Australian Senate. The Labor Party and crossbenchers should do the same. We need a public broadcasting ombudsman and FOI decisions not done by the ABC for the ABC.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Trikafta is a transformative medicine that can change the lives of 90% of people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Up to 2200 Australians are desperately waiting for access to this life-saving medicine. People in the US have had access for 2 years and 19 countries have provided access to Trikafta. Yet in Australia Trikafta has been deferred twice and partially approved (for 20%) at the third meeting. Majority of the CF community in Australia is being left behind, due to an impasse in negotiations between Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the PBAC. Australia is 17th out of 20 OECD countries in terms of access to new medicines. This was shown with Kalydeco, the first of these life-saving CF medicines, taking 7X longer than the US, and 2-3X longer than many European countries. The difference between these countries and Australia is a faster and more flexible reimbursement process. The flexibility in these models allows access to medicines years earlier through mechanisms like access provided prior to reimbursement or pipeline agreements covering medicine portfolios. We hope the current parliamentary inquiry considers these options, with this inquiry leading to significant improvements to the speed of medicine approvals. With half of those with CF currently dying by age 30, Australians with CF need immediate access to Trikafta and need a flexible system that prioritises fast access to life-saving medicines.</span>

It has been promoted by a number of people, including Genevieve Handley as the principal petitioner. Trikafta is a life-saving and life-changing treatment for people with cystic fibrosis who have at least one copy of the common delta F508 mutation. We've seen people taken off the heart and lung transplant list, and we've seen people's lives saved by this life-changing genetic treatment. I encourage the Department of Health and the minister to immediately approve the use of Trikafta for all those who have at least one copy of the delta F508 gene, which is by far the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis, a severe disorder which often used to be fatal in childhood. With new genetic treatments, people can live to near-normal or normal life expectancies. I'd encourage the minister to act as soon as he possibly can.</span>

Last week, I was honoured to participate in the opening of the Shepparton Art Museum, a $50 million project that this federal government has contributed $15 million towards, while $15 million has also come from the Greater Shepparton City Council and $7 million from the SAM Foundation, along with $10 million from the state. SAM will display works from over 200 artists, with 160 Indigenous and First Nations artworks in addition to a ceramics collection that is unrivalled anywhere else in Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his role in the opening last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The weekend prior to the opening of the SAM, we also had an opportunity to open the Museum of Vehicle Evolution, better known as MOVE. MOVE has been transformed after a $5.3 million upgrade, which the federal government contributed $2.5 million towards. MOVE has now been expanded to just under 10,000 square metres. It houses the museum's collection of cars, motorbikes, trucks and vintage clothing and also acknowledges the rich history of transport throughout the Goulburn Valley region. It will now highlight a collection of trucks that will be unrivalled anywhere else in Australia. I wish to acknowledge and congratulate every person in Nicholls that has helped bring these two amazing projects to fruition.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  It is costing the Australian taxpayer more than $350,000 per month to hold a single refugee in immigration detention on Nauru. That's right—$350,000 per month, nearly $4.3 million per year,  for just one refugee. At a time when there are more than 100 asylum seekers and refugees on the island, many detained for over eight years, that brings the total cost to about $1.7 billion. Imagine if this government had such a dogged commitment to caring for people rather than persecuting them. Just imagine this sort of cash going instead to health care, education, public housing, increased pensions and payments and more home-care packages. That's just the start of my list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mind you, it's obviously not the financial but the human cost that many Australians find particularly devastating. Remember, these young men on Nauru have been locked up for years in appalling conditions and separated from their families simply because they were fleeing for their lives and asked Australia to protect them. I've said it countless times in this place, but I need to say it again: Australia has a legal and moral obligation to protect people claiming to be fleeing persecution, to quickly hear their claims and to provide permanent refuge if their claims are upheld. That's what's needed. That's what a government with integrity would do and do now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  I recently travelled to Lakeland, located a few hundred kilometres north-west of Cairns, for the official opening of a new sporting oval and facilities. This wasn't just another sporting field or simply another opening. The sporting field was named in honour of Cape York legend Alan Wilson. The Alan Wilson Oval is a fitting legacy to a person who has dedicated his life to serving his community in many different capacities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan, who now lives in the Tablelands, has had many careers, including Northern Territory police officer, my cattle station manager at Olive Vale in Cape York, publican and roadhouse owner. However, Alan has always been remembered as being a hardworking, passionate and dedicated councillor and deputy mayor with the Cook Shire Council for over 16 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that Alan has always been remembered for is his decades-long campaign to see a container deposit scheme established in Queensland. His unwavering dedication paid dividends in the Queensland government's introducing the new, highly successful Containers for Change scheme. A lot of people told Alan it'd never be done, but it just goes to show what can be achieved by someone with the passion and dogged determination to change something for the better. Finally, I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the Lakeland Progress Association, whose idea it was to name the new sports oval in honour of not only a Cape York legend but a very decent person and an all-round top bloke.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  The Central Coast is mourning the loss of its famous sporting son, cricketer Alan Davidson, who died surrounded by family on 30 October, age 92. Alan was born in Lisarow in 1929 and grew up on his family's rural property. He honed his cricketing skills on a pitch he dug out himself, bowling oranges at stumps he made out of gumtree branches. Alan played 44 tests for Australia between 1953 and 1963 and was a star for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A left-arm paceman, Alan is regarded as one of Australia's greatest all-rounders. He took 186 test wickets over his career and made five half centuries with the bat. In the field his catching skills earned him the nickname 'The Claw'. Perhaps the highest point of his career came in the famous tied test against the West Indies in 1960. He took five for 135 in the West Indies' first innings and six for 87 in the second. He made a handy 44 runs in Australia's first innings and was run out, much to his annoyance, for 80 in the second innings, his highest ever test score—becoming the first male player to achieve the double of 100 runs and 10 wickets in the same test.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following his retirement from test cricket, Alan continued to contribute to the game as an administrator, selector and mentor. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1987. His memory is honoured at the Alan Davidson Oval in Wyoming. Vale Alan Davidson.</span>

Mr Coombes is a co-founder of the charity Tour de Cure and is dedicated to seeing a world without cancer. Since the organisation's founding in 2007 Tour de Cure has raised $66 million, funding over 554 cancer projects and playing a role in 54 significant breakthroughs in research and care. Each year the organisation holds numerous tours and events to further their mission to cure and change lives. Mr Coombes currently works as the director of development for Tour de Cure, engaging with corporate partners in pursuit of a cure for cancer.</span>

From three mates meeting up for coffee to a national movement with thousands of supporters, Mr Coombes and the Tour de Cure team should be proud of all they have achieved for those impacted by cancer, both on the Northern Beaches and right around the world.</span>

Made possible by $5 million of funding from the Morrison Liberal government, the centre is one of six veteran wellbeing centres around Australia. The centre is now home to the RSL, Open Arms Australia, Soldier On and, of course, the Plympton Veterans Centre—and I pay tribute to their veterans advocates: Tich Tyson, Bill Hignett and Graham 'Ruddy' Rudd—who I recently visited. The veterans centre is complemented by the refurbished SPF Hall, the town square and the neighbouring sports gymnasium, which offers sports such as wheelchair basketball.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I returned to the Repat for Remembrance Day and, along with many of the veterans in attendance, saw the state Minister for Health and Wellbeing, the Hon. Stephen Wade MLC, plant in the town square a lone pine which is a descendant of the original Gallipoli Lone Pine. This is a fitting tribute to the thousands of Australian veterans who have been supported and cared for at the Repat during its long and proud history. I am incredibly proud to have secured funding for the Repat as part of more than $40 million of Morrison Liberal government funding towards its reactivation, which also includes a specialist dementia unit and a brand-new brain and spinal unit. The former state Labor government shamefully closed the Repat hospital, but, thanks to the Morrison and Marshall Liberal governments, it is once again thriving.</span>

But he left his job in 2013 to be his mother's full-time carer until she died in 2015. He then became a taxi driver, but 60 hours of work a week to make $400 didn't work. He used his money to try to be an owner-driver and couldn't make money out of that. He took out all of his super, and that lasted a year. He is now on unemployment benefits, and his job provider is sending him to get a cert III when, as he says, he's capable of working. He just wants to work. He doesn't want to earn a huge income; he just wants to be able to pay his rent and his debts and live comfortably.</span>

Christmas lights are beginning to coruscate in the streets of North Sydney as residents prepare to embrace this upcoming Christmas season. Adding to the joyous Christmas spirit, I was delighted to hold once again my annual Christmas card competition for school students in my electorate, and as always the entries were spectacular.

The future of Australian art is incredibly bright if North Sydney is any judge.</span>

Rounding out the top four were Oscar Worthington of St Thomas Primary School; Ava Kebsch from St Michael's Catholic Primary School; and Eve Whitear, who attends Lane Cove Public School. All four entries were remarkable. I found it, in fact, very difficult to choose a winner. I received hundreds of entries from several schools in my electorate, and I'd like to acknowledge and thank the students and teachers from Mowbray Public School, St Michael's, Cammeray Public School, Northbridge Public School, North Sydney Demonstration School, Chatswood Public School, Hunters Hill Public School, Wenona junior school, Saint Thomas Primary School, St Philip Neri Primary School, Boronia Park Public School and Lane Cove Public School.</span>

To all the people in North Sydney and right around Australia: I hope you have a joyous and safe Christmas with your families, who, in many cases, have been apart for far too long.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  There are lots of moments this week that are in competition for the top 10 terrible moments of this government, but one that is definitely on the list involved the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations and his answer about labour hire, in which he said that it's just a non-issue—'a made-up issue'. This clearly demonstrates that this minister has no idea what's going on with labour hire. He has no idea that you have two workers working side by side, but one is being paid less than the other simply because they are working for labour hire. He tried to say that the better off overall test applied. You know what, I wish it did. I wish that the better off overall test didn't just apply to the workers on the collective agreement, but applied to all the workers at a workplace. That is one way to fix the labour hire issue, and if the minister wanted to bring that in as a bill we could debate that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in the absence of that bill being before us; in the absence of the government actually doing something positive to help workers on labour hire agreements, who are being paid less than their co-workers; they should support Labor's bill. The bill that is before the House is all about same job, same pay. If we in this country believe that if you do a fair day's work you get a fair day's pay, then we should have workers who are doing the same job getting the same pay. And they could start with their own workers. It is appalling that public servants doing the same job are on different rates of pay.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  As part of their education on the Great War, students from Freshwater Bay Primary School recently marked the unmarked graves of fallen soldiers at Karrakatta Cemetery. These soldiers have been acknowledged by the Australian government as having died from the effects of war and were originally honoured with a war grave and granite headstone. However, the headstones no longer stand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This amazing Remembrance Day project was a truly collaborative community effort, initiated by Ben Turner at Freshwater Primary School, coordinated by the Claremont and Nedlands branches of the RSL, with Ian Jones from the Showgrounds Community Men's Shed crafting each of the wooden crosses. The year 6 students researched the soldiers, whose official war graves had been destroyed, and decorated a wooden cross to be laid at their unmarked grave. Two days prior to Remembrance Day, 56 students visited Karrakatta and laid their crosses to mark the graves of 35 soldiers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to record my admiration and thanks to all of those involved, but I also want to note my absolute disgust at the removal of the headstones of our World War I vets at Karrakatta and the building of footpaths over some of their graves. I want to assure the local RSLs and the vets' families that I will continue to work with them to ensure that this abject injustice is remedied.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  In the Americas it's Thanksgiving today and, as you'd know, it's practice over there to pardon a turkey. That's good for the turkeys because nobody is going to pardon any of this mob over here who just voted not once but twice to block a federal anticorruption commission. We're about to hear lots of mendacious gobbling from the Prime Minister about how hard he's been working on this. Frankly, after 1,077 days, it's time to just pee or get off the pot. </span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>The Prime Minister is always confident about telling Australians about the things that they know. Well, we've got a message for the Prime Minister. Australians know about sports rorts, they know about car park rorts, they know about Helloworld Travel rorts, they know about the Leppington Triangle rort, and they know about the granddaddy rort of them all: $20 billion of taxpayers' money paid out to companies to pay executive bonuses and to plump up the profits that they didn't need. Of course, Australians really know the big reason why this Prime Minister doesn't want a federal anticorruption commission. The reason this guy doesn't want a federal anticorruption commission is that when you're in the witness box you've got to tell the truth, and that's something that this Prime Minister just can't do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired.)</span></span>

Another milestone has been reached—that is, more than 90 per cent of Victorians aged over 16 have now been vaccinated. This is a significant achievement by the people of Victoria, and I want to thank all those in Victoria for rolling up their sleeves, getting vaccinated and pushing through what has been the hardest experience of this pandemic. I thank them for pushing through, and I know this will be a moment that they can savour.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national plan, which gets Australia open safely so we can remain safely open, is working. We're seeing it again with these achievements in Victoria today. We have already seen South Australia open up this week, the return of students and skilled migrants, and the opening-up to Japan, Korea and Singapore, which is underway. Over the course of this pandemic, what really matters is we have the one of the lowest fatality rates in the world as a result of our response to COVID. We have one of the strongest economies of the advanced world in how we have come through this pandemic, and we now have, as Victoria has demonstrated again, one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. That sets Australia up. Australians have worked hard to achieve that to set up the opportunity we now have to secure Australia's economic recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite might want to play games in this parliament, but we are very focused on securing the economic recovery for Australians. That's what our focus is. That's where we're looking. We are looking forward to that economic recovery which Australians are depending on and Australians are relying on. That is the most important issue that our government, working together, is pursuing, to ensure jobs, skills and investment and to put downward pressure on the cost of living. That is what the Australian people are expecting from their government, and it is being delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are driving investment through our instant asset write-off. We're increasing jobs. We're boosting skills, with some 217,000 people in apprentice training. We've got lower taxes. We've got a million people back working in manufacturing right now. We're getting electricity prices down. This is what matters to Australians—their jobs, their economic futures, their ability to plan for their own futures with confidence. You cannot take the economic recovery for granted. You cannot take it for granted with the challenges Australians are facing. Our government has demonstrated its economic management credentials, and that's what can give Australians confidence.</span>

To date, she's achieved in excess of $1.1 billion worth of infrastructure from total federal contributions for the seat of Mallee. I note the work she's done for the Henty Highway, from Horsham to Warracknabeal. I note the work she's done on the Western Highway upgrade, from Stawell to the South Australian border. I note the work she's done on the Calder Highway, with further overtaking lanes north of Hattah. I note the work the member for Mallee has done on the Sunraysia irrigation scheme, the Sunraysia modernisation project. I note the work that she continues to do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">By reason of being a regional member, I note that she is welcoming of the new appointments to the Infrastructure Australia board: Ms Vicky Meyer, Councillor Meade, Ms Amanda Cooper, Ms Elizabeth Schmidt, Dr Vanessa Guthrie, Mr Robert Moffat and Mr Col Murray. This allows us to have a board that is both 50 per cent women and 50 per cent men. I think that is a very good outcome. I note that, of the 12 candidates on the initial board, only two were women. We are making sure we address that because we believe we need people with qualifications from being in business and also from being in public service and local government and also the qualifications of such people as Dr Vanessa Guthrie, a PhD in geology, amongst other things, and Mr Robert Moffat, who has been the chief executive officer of the Australasian Centre for Rail Innovation. These are the people that show the proper representation across the length and breadth of Australia, both regional and urban Australia and both male and female. This is incredibly important to the member for Mallee, as it is to the member for Capricornia.</span>

I noted today correspondence that we must drive the Queensland government to get that project completed. We also note projects such as Dungowan Dam. We are looking forward to it. I have been having strong conversations with Deputy Premier Paul Toole to get that from studies to actual construction. It is vitally important that we build the infrastructure to make this nation strong. Our job is to make this nation as strong as possible as quickly as possible, and we are doing precisely that. I welcome the new members to the Infrastructure Australia board to assist in that process.</span>

Those opposite do not support our proposal for a Commonwealth integrity commission. Instead, they want one which does not sufficiently provide procedural fairness to individuals that are investigated for conduct. They want one that would allow the use of significant coercive powers on low-level misconduct and disciplinary offences. They want one that would not safeguard against vexatious, baseless, politically motivated and time-wasting referrals, which the shadow Attorney-General is well known for. He has a perfect strike rate of making vexatious claims which have been refused by proper authorities and which detract from legitimate investigation. They want to support something that does not include mechanisms to protect national security information, that does not include protections for journalists and their sources and that would compromise potential prosecutions of corrupt conduct by overly publicising investigations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:14</span>):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in 2019 you explicitly stated that the TPI Federation had a compelling case to restore the eroded compensation of Australia's 28,000 totally and permanently incapacitated veterans. More recently, a Senate inquiry into the matter recommended that the Australian government consider an increase in the TPI payment to arrest and remedy the seven-decade decline in the real value of compensation. Prime Minister, will the government finally stop the delays, rhetoric and obfuscation and recognise the injustice being perpetrated against our TPI veterans? In particular, will the government rightly increase their payments in the 2020-21 MYEFO so that the economic loss component is benchmarked to the tax-adjusted minimum wage?</span>

The government honours and respects the service of our TPI veterans, whose wellbeing has been severely impacted by their service. I have met with the TPI Federation and I have heard their case directly. I commissioned an independent review, as you know, of the TPI payment, which was undertaken by the respected former secretary of the Department of Finance, Mr David Tune. Mr Tune made a number of recommendations that the government accepted and progressed in the 2020-21 budget, which included changes to the disability pension which were then brought forward to be implemented sooner in the 2021-22 budget.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcomed the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report into the TPI payment, and we commend the committee for the thoroughness with which it considered the complex issues raised in the course of that inquiry. We will now consider those recommendations of the committee together with the views of the ex-service community and the previous reviews undertaken into the TPI payment when considering future policy options for support of TPI veterans. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs may wish to add to my answer.</span>

On this side of the House, we have many veterans, as there are on that side of the House as well, and we know how important it is to make sure that our veterans and their families have the best possible care our country can provide.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has stated, David Tune did carry out an independent review of TPI payments, and the Australian government, our government, has accepted all of those recommendations. One of his recommendations was to provide targeted assistance to TPI veterans with income-tested pension who pay private rent. In short, he recommended that we abolish the disability income rent test from the Veterans' Entitlement Act, or VEA. This recommendation is addressed in our bill before the parliament at the moment, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Exempting Disability Payments from Income Testing and Other Measures) Bill 2021. It's in this House at the moment. That bill will ensure that disabled veterans will now have the same access to rent assistance as those Australians who receive it from Centrelink. It addresses a key finding of the Tune review.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a fundamental difference between the values that drive the economic policies put in place by this coalition of Liberals and Nationals and the values that drive the coalition on the other side between the Labor Party and the Greens. We believe in lower taxes for families, we believe in backing small business to grow, and we believe in encouraging the individual and their enterprise. Those policies include cutting taxes for small business, and we have cut the headline company tax rate for small business down to 25 per cent, the lowest in 50 years. We've also put in place the biggest investment incentives that Australia has seen. Those incentives are driving more investment in machinery and equipment across Australia and across businesses in Reid and other electorates represented on this side of the House. Today, in the ABS payroll jobs data for the last fortnight, we have seen an increase in jobs across the country. Jobs are now 3.9 per cent higher than going into this pandemic. Jobs are now higher in every state and territory. The Australian economy is on the road to recovery. </span>

The Labor Party do not support it. The government has funded nearly $150 million to support the establishment of a Commonwealth integrity commission. Our proposed commission will investigate specified criminal corruption across the whole of the public sector, including parliamentarians and their staff. It will have two divisions. The law enforcement integrity division will have the same function as ACLEI. The public sector integrity division will be able to investigate allegations of criminal conduct in the rest of the Commonwealth public sector, as well as higher education providers and research bodies that receive Commonwealth funding. Our proposed commission will have a full suite of powers to investigate corrupt conduct, including to require people to give sworn evidence at hearings; to confiscate people's passports by court order; to search people's houses and seize their property under warrant; to conduct a search of a person under warrant; and, where necessary, to tap phones and use other surveillance devices to investigate them. The proposed Commonwealth Integrity Commission that we put forward and the law enforcement integrity division will be able to hold public hearings. That's our proposal. Why don't the Labor Party support it?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been out for public consultation for a long time—even the draft legislation is there before them—but they don't want a Commonwealth integrity commission. They want a Commonwealth kangaroo court that can go and pry and pursue political vendettas, as we've seen in New South Wales with the disgraceful treatment of the former Premier of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, who was chased out of office before they'd even made a finding. The Leader of the Labor Party may support what was done to Gladys Berejiklian, but I do not.</span>

How do measures like these strengthen our economic recovery, and is the Treasurer aware of any alternative approaches?</span>

I would like to thank the member for Higgins for her question and acknowledge her experience as a paediatrician, as a world-leading medical researcher and as someone who supports small business across her electorate. More than 25,000 small businesses in the electorate of Higgins are eligible for the expanded instant asset write-off, like a local Snap printing business, which was able to buy a new printer and support their four employees with the new business investment incentives that we've announced in recent budgets.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With COVID-19, Australia has encountered the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression. We saw some forecasts last year saying that the unemployment rate could reach as high as 15 per cent. That's more than two million Australians who are unemployed. We know that the experience of previous recessions in the 1980s and the 1990s was of a scarring of the labour market. It took between eight and 10 years to get the unemployment rate back to where it was before those recessions. This time around, the experience of the Australian labour market and the experience of the Australian economy has been very different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took just over a year to get the unemployment rate back to where we were, and today the unemployment rate, at 5.2 per cent, is lower than it was when we came to government. We've seen today that payroll jobs are up, and we've seen that, across every state and territory in the Commonwealth, jobs are now higher than they were when we were going into the pandemic. One of the reasons for that is our policies to drive down taxes for families, by legislating to abolish a whole tax bracket—the 37c in the dollar tax bracket—and also putting in place a small-business tax cut, down to 25 per cent, which ensures that small businesses' taxes are now at their lowest in 50 years. This is helping to create jobs. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked: are there any alternative approaches? We know that those opposite, at the last election, took $387 billion of higher taxes. I know they're running around saying that their policies won't be identical to the last election, but I was surprised—or maybe not so surprised—to read on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> on 29 September the headline 'Jim Chalmers proposes Bill Shorten era family trusts tax hit'. That's a $27 billion hit on family businesses. They cry crocodile tears for small business. There's only one side of this House that supports small business, and that's the Liberals and Nationals in this coalition.</span>

He's so focused on what's going on down here in Canberra that what he can't hear, what he fails to hear, is what is going on around the rest of this country and where their focus is. Their focus is on how the economic recovery is going to be secured, and that's what our government is focused on.</span>

Our government has been focused on the fact that we now have a million Australians who are working in manufacturing. Under Labor, one in eight manufacturing jobs had gone—absolutely gone. Our government is focusing on ensuring we have reliable and affordable energy, so we're building a gas-fired peaking plant up in Kurri Kurri to ensure that the people of the Hunter Valley can have those jobs, support the heavy industries and keep electricity prices down, and the Labor Party is opposing it.</span>

Getting Australians into homes. Getting electricity prices down. Getting Australians into jobs. Leading Australia through one of the worst pandemics we've seen in 100 years. One of the highest vaccination rates in the world. One of the strongest economies coming through the pandemic. And, of course, one of the lowest fatality rates.</span>

As someone who was a small-business owner before coming into this place, he knows the enormous importance of affordable, reliable power for small businesses. He knows the key to delivering that affordable, reliable electricity is focusing on the customer, and that's exactly what we have been doing in recent years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We put in place the 'big stick' legislation, which those opposite oppose, and we subsequently saw 19 consecutive months of wholesale price reductions. We introduced a price cap on electricity prices for those who aren't able to shop around. As a result of that, we saw prices come down, on average, by $780 for a household and over $3,100 for a small business. We've seen gaps in the market that we've filled—2,000 megawatts in Snowy 2.0 and over 650 megawatts at Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley, which those opposite opposed as well. Under our government we have seen average household prices, which make up a third of the electricity bill, down more than 22 per cent in the last 12 months and more than 63 per cent in the last two years. The ABS CPI data tells us we have seen 11 consecutive quarters of retail price reductions. And today we see a report from the AEMC that tells us we can expect another six per cent retail price reduction in the coming years. This is all about putting customers ahead of other interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked about alternative approaches. When those opposite were last in government they put in place an alternative approach, and it saw a doubling of electricity prices. Every quarter those opposite were in power, the price went up, according to the ABS—every single quarter. Those opposite are opposing the job-creating investments in the Hunter Valley. They opposed, many times over, the big stick legislation. There's one thing you can be absolutely sure of: you will pay more for electricity under Labor than under this side of the parliament. We will always stand up for Australians ahead of other interests. Those opposite won't. We fight every day for a fair deal for Australians on electricity prices.</span>

Honestly, if you've got a small question to ask, ask the opposition. Because they only deal with small questions. If you've got a big question about what's going to happen with the economy, how are we going to guarantee national security, how are you going to cut taxes, how are we going to put pressure downward on costs of living and get electricity prices down, how are we going to get more people in trades training and ensure a million people are working in manufacturing and staying in those jobs—our government has the answers to those. Those opposite think whinging and whining and sledging is a recipe for getting into government. But it's not. You've actually got to have policies. You've actually got to have plans. You can't just stand up every day and have a whinge and a whine and a bit of a carry on. That's still why we don't know what their 2030 target is and we still don't know what all their tax policies are. That's why we can only go on what they've done before. What have they done before? $387 billion of higher taxes. They put a carbon tax on when they were last in government. They cut defence spending to the lowest levels, as a share of a our economy, since prior to the Second World War. They lost control of our borders. You want to talk about losing control? They lost control of our borders, and the Leader of the Opposition was front and centre when the weakness of that government was displayed.</span>

The other reason why I believe and know that Australians are listening is that this government knows how to stand up for their interests and stand up to those who would seek to compromise their interests. I know, and our government knows, how to stand up to those countries not too far from here that would seek to coerce us and interfere in our country, in our universities, in our laws, and seek to affect us with trade and other forums. We know how to do that. We know how to call out action when it comes to human rights abuses overseas. We're not afraid to do that. We're not afraid to stand up to the bullies and the bigots and the bots who get on social media and try to troll those of religious faith. We're very happy to stand up to the big banks, the big energy companies, the multinationals or the big digital platforms when we've had to take them on—and we have. We've also been prepared to stand up to the organised criminal gangs and take them down. We've stood up to the people smugglers, and we'll stand up to all of those who seek to compromise the interests and affairs and best interests of our nation. It takes strength to lead this country—a strength the leader of the Labor Party does not possess in his very— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

She has had an enduring commitment and dedication to home ownership, to aspiration and to first home buyers, as does our Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, there was a real choice for Australians. On one hand, we had a focus on first home buyers' aspiration, and, on the other hand, with the Labor Party, we had the politics of envy and really no strategy for home ownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the last election, the government has put in place a number of programs to support first home buyers, to support the residential construction industry and to support home ownership, whether it be the HomeBuilder program, with $25,000 grants to encourage people and help people purchase a new home, or our home guarantee schemes, which include the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, which has helped first home buyers purchase a home with a deposit of as little as five per cent, or our Family Home Guarantee, which we announced in the budget, which is assisting single parents—predominantly, single mothers—to purchase a home with a deposit of two per cent, or the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which helps first home buyers accelerate their savings, because we know getting the deposit together is the hardest part of purchasing a home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, we released data that is very encouraging. It shows that, amongst those four programs, since the last election, 320,000 Australians are in a home today directly because of one of those programs put in place by our Prime Minister and this government. That means every single person in this chamber today will have, on average, more than 2,000 people in your electorate who are in a home thanks to the Morrison government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about alternative policies or alternative approaches. Very disappointingly, we didn't get much help from the Labor Party during the pandemic, and the HomeBuilder program was a prime example of that. We have had 135,000 HomeBuilder projects, and it was opposed by the Labor Party.</span>

More than 250,000 Australians are in a home with the help of the HomeBuilder program, and the Labor Party opposes it. The Leader of the Opposition, in remarks related to HomeBuilder, said it was funding pearl taps and gold baths. I can tell the Leader of the Opposition that it's helped first home buyers get into a home.</span>

So, then, when you look at the numbers and—you can go to the numbers, and I encourage the shadow minister to do that—you look at 2019 and the university sector received $17.3 billion from the Commonwealth. In 2021, it was $20.4 billion. We've been there to support those academics, we've been there to support the research, we've been there to create further opportunities for Australian students, and there have never been more opportunities for Australian students than there are today, and so many of those courses are cheaper under us as well, particularly those courses which lead into a job. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced further policy to support the university sector and translate their great ideas into commercial products, and they know that we are backing them.</span>

Our government strongly condemns anyone who incites violence and hatred, no matter what their motivation may be. Our law enforcement agencies target criminal activity, regardless of an individual's ideology or their background, and they won't hesitate to bring the full force, the full weight, of the law on any individual or any group that actively threatens the safety of others.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that ideologically motivated violent extremism, in particular nationalist and racist violent extremism, comprises around 50 per cent of ASIO's priority onshore counterterrorism case load. This sort of extremism has been in ASIO's sights for many, many years, and it has maintained continuous and dedicated resources to this area. Last year alone, three nationalist and racist violent extremists were charged with terrorist offences, and one individual, Phillip Galea, was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment following his conviction for terrorism offences. Let me be clear: there is absolutely no place in Australia for those views and there never will be.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the coalition came to government, no ideologically motivated groups were listed as terrorist organisations. We changed that. We listed Sonnenkrieg Division, and yesterday I announced our intention to list The Base, another disgusting and abhorrent Neo-Nazi group. I was frankly disappointed that others who should know better seemed almost dismissive of this action because it is a predominantly overseas based group. This shows a very serious and dangerous misunderstanding of the way these groups operate and the threat that they represent to us here in Australia. We know this is a global problem, and our goal is to stop Australians being recruited to these evil causes. We've seen that threat so close to our shores with the horrific Christchurch terrorist attack, and we as a government acted very quickly, very swiftly, as a founding member of the Christchurch Call to Action, to establish the Taskforce to Combat Terrorist and Extreme Violent Material Online. The Morrison government is always going to focus on protecting Australians and our way of life here. We will always focus on keeping Australians safe and secure, because serious issues like the safety and security of Australians are what we all should be focused on in this place. These are the serious issues that Australians expect their parliament to focus on and they expect everyone in this place to be focused on this.</span>

My question is to the Prime Minister. Eligibility for the National Disability Insurance Scheme requires that a person have a profound and severe lifelong disability, but today on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> his NDIS minister says that the scheme was never intended to function as a welfare scheme for life. Does the Prime Minister agree with his minister that Australians living with a lifetime of profound and severe disability should expect a lifetime of NDIS support?</span>

I've supported it every single day I've been here since it was brought into this chamber many years ago by those opposite, and I believe it should be a matter of bipartisan support, continuing as it was when it was introduced. That is certainly the approach I have taken in opposition and in government, as a minister, a Treasurer and a Prime Minister, and I will continue to. It is providing Australians with disabilities with opportunities that, when people of our generation were growing up, we would never have dreamed of, and I think that says marvellous things about our country. It is a very demanding scheme in terms of its fiscal cost. Australians are bearing that cost and we will continue to. We need to ensure that it's run efficiently and we need to ensure that it isn't subjected to any form of abuse, because, by protecting it against abuse, we are protecting the people who it is intended to support. So let there be no doubt that my government believes in the NDIS. We've demonstrated that by fully funding it every single day and we will continue to.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:55</span>):  I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and for his hard work in supporting 14,000 small and medium-sized businesses in his electorate. He's a man who knows how to operate small businesses, having proudly been involved in a crocodile farm in a former life. The member is indeed the 'King of the North' for the parochial and hardworking stand he takes in defending the north.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a pleasure to be able to address the House and update the House on not just the green shoots that are growing up in the north, because of the hard work of the member up there, but what happens when we stick to the national plan. We see tourists coming back into cafes in Cairns as well as consumption across the country. In fact, I was recently up in the member's electorate speaking to the member's small businesses and the message was consistent: stick to the national plan so that those down south can get up north. This government has stood shoulder to shoulder with small businesses across the country during the pandemic. And it's because we know collectively that small business is a big deal, and this side of the House wants to make small businesses bigger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are over 3½ million small and family businesses across our great country. They're over 99 per cent of total businesses and they employ almost half of all Australians. That is why the Morrison government has put in place the largest fiscal supports in history during this pandemic to get Australia's small businesses through: over $291 billion in direct economic support through key initiatives that impact small business; JobKeeper payments to support employers to retain their employees; boosting cash-flow measures; the small and medium enterprise guarantee scheme; the extension of the instant asset write-off; extended and accelerated income support; early release of super and tax support; and, of course, for small businesses we've reduced tax from 30 per cent to 25 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to report to the House and to the member for Leichhardt that the economic plan of the Morrison government is working. Jobs are roaring back, and there has never been a better time for Australians to get a job and for Australian small businesses to hire Australians. The internet vacancy index put out monthly by the National Skills Commission shows a 7.8 per cent increase last month in the number of jobs available. The IVI, the internet vacancy index, has a quarter of a million jobs—a 13-year high—and 2.64 million jobs have been advertised over the last 12 months. Australian small businesses know who's got their back, they know they have a choice and they know the Morrison government will stump for them every single time.</span>

Today is International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, a day to take stock of the challenge we face and remember those we have lost to this insidious cause. As Kofi Annan said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation and it is perhaps the most pervasive. It knows no boundaries of geography, culture or wealth. As long as it continues, we cannot claim to be making real progress towards equality, development and peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Globally, one in three women aged 15 or older have experienced sexual or physical violence and 137 women are killed by a member of their family every single day. Closer to home, 68 per cent of women in the Pacific have experienced violence by an intimate partner. In Australia, a woman is killed by a partner every 11 days, and one in five women over the age of 15 has experienced sexual violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family, domestic and sexual violence is everybody's business, and it is exceptionally important that we particularly listen this day to the voices of First Nations women and girls in this process. That is why today the government has announced, in conjunction with a number of incredibly strong Indigenous women, our support for the Wiyi Yani U Thangani National Summit to amplify the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and girls. These voices need to be heard to make sure that we have a dedicated action plan for Indigenous women and girls. Their leadership and empowerment at local level is so important to provide that national platform for healing intergenerational trauma.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an area where there is just so much more to do. Our surveys indicate that one in seven Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have experienced physical violence in the past 12 months. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of that violence than non-Indigenous women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are taking a leadership role. That is why, yesterday, we committed to establishing a domestic violence commission and commissioner. There is, as I always say in this area, much work to do, as we recognise and respect those who do that work on the front line every single day, not just today. This government and parliament are resolute in the aim of stopping violence against women and children. We are not there yet, but we will continue to do everything we can to get there.</span>

I refer to the Jenkins Independent Review into Commonwealth Parliamentary Workplaces by the Australian Human Rights Commission. Isn't it the case, Prime Minister, that both sides, and indeed all, of the parliament participated constructively in that review? Isn't it also the case that the best way to ensure these issues are not politicised is by being transparent and tabling the report when it is received by the government next week?</span>

As I have just said to the opposition, we have worked together on these issues and we will continue to work together in good faith on these issues. The government will receive the report, consider it and then release it; that is the way these matters are held, and we will do that process in good faith. If the opposition are trying to accuse the government of bad faith on this, they can do that. But I don't think that would be constructive. What I have said is we will continue to engage in this matter in good faith. We will receive the report, we will consider it and we will release it. Once we receive that report we will be in a position to advise the House further. The Special Minister of State may wish to add to the answer.</span>

Can I just say to the House that we all have a responsibility as members of parliament to our workplace and our staff. This has been a very important piece of work done by Kate Jenkins. It deserves to be above politics. It is the government's intention to work with the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the implementation of this report. I don't believe this is a matter we should be debating in question time today, but the Leader of the Opposition is quite right if he'd like to ask questions here. There has never been an indication from the government that we will do anything other than seek to work with all members of parliament, including the crossbench and other minor parties, and with the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party in relation to this very, very important piece of work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all those members of parliament that have participated in the Jenkins review and to thank all those staff members that we owe it to to provide the best possible workplace here in this parliament. We owe it to those staff and we owe it to each other to make sure we provide that best possible workplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On how this government deals with this review once it's received: at this point, given it's a Human Rights Commission review, I can't tell you what time of day it will be received by the government. But it is the government's intention to ensure that we put the politics of this behind us, that we focus on working cooperatively with all members of parliament, including the Leader of the Opposition, to make sure we do our duty to provide the best possible workplace for our staff. We will engage further with the Leader of the Opposition, with leaders of other parties and with the crossbench in relation to this review once it has been received by the government. But the suggestion that the government would sit on this review, the suggestion that we would withhold this review, I would like to make very clear to all members, is not one that this government is entertaining at all.</span>

So the least we can do in return is make sure they have the best possible care, treatment and support our country can provide. That's why, this year, we're investing $11.7 billion to support 336,000 veterans and their families with care and support, including free mental health care for life.</span>

That could affect up to 7,000 veterans. We're also going to ensure that those veterans who've had a win and a benefit under Douglas will keep that benefit. Ultimately, this is about ensuring that there's more money going into the pockets of vulnerable veterans, and we'll be working closely with stakeholders to ensure that we can get that legislation right and get it through the House next year. </span>

A second decision was needed on a differently formulated question, simply because a decision against a proposal to disagree to a motion is not the same as a decision in favour of a motion. The second question enabled a vote on whether the suspension motion should be agreed to, which is the question under standing order 47(c). That requires an absolute majority in order for it to be carried. If members thought this was unusual, they are correct, as there is usually no need for a second question because of the result of the initial question. I regret if members were concerned about having to change sides of the chamber to vote, given the COVID safety arrangements the House has been operating under. On the other hand, this one exception in almost two years highlights just how successful the arrangements have been.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  Watching this Prime Minister try to navigate his way through parliament this week reminded me of a Malcolm Tucker quote, 'This is like a clown running across a minefield,' because the fleas are jumping off this dog of a government. The Prime Minister, when he took over and knocked off Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister, described the coalition as a 'muppet show'. Well, he is now the muppet in chief. We know that the theme song of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Muppet Show</span> says, 'It's like a kind of torture to have to watch the show,' and indeed it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we saw, on the national anticorruption commission, a government lose not one but two votes on the floor of the parliament. Then, when we asked about that in question time, he said it's our fault that they haven't introduced legislation on a national integrity commission, which they said they would more than a thousand days ago. On the Religious Discrimination Bill, which should be above politics, there was no attempt to reach out to the opposition. And I thought, 'That was a bit rough.' But then I found out they didn't even give it to their own party room before they debated it, so perhaps we shouldn't be so sensitive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the net zero by 2050 vibe that they've adopted. They can't legislate it. Apparently, no-one's told them that what we debate in this place is legislation. Apparently it's bad. Then they have the target that Tony Abbott established in 2015 to cut emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030. Even though they say they're going to cut emissions by 30 to 35 per cent, they can't change it because the Nats won't let them and half their own party room won't let them. So the Prime Minister goes to Glasgow. That all went well, that international trip. And so he goes to Glasgow after the debacle in Rome. He gave an empty speech to an empty room and then he left. Australia signed up to going to next year's conference of the parties on climate change with a higher target. Australia signed up to that, and then they put out a statement the same day saying they wouldn't do that. Nothing to see here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we get to the issue of vaccines, and that's where it gets really ugly. We had five senators cross the floor to vote for a One Nation position. We have a Prime Minister who's been saying, 'People should be able to get a cup of coffee in Brisbane without showing their vaccination certificate,' without seemingly being aware that the same provisions apply in Sydney. And then we had the protests—an area where we need leadership. The Prime Minister's response was part dog's breakfast, part dog whistle. That was his response, out there, refusing to unequivocally do what a leader was required to do when gallows appeared outside of a parliament and when people were threatening—threatening—to murder members of parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After two years of disruption, Australians need to put the pandemic behind us. We all agree with that. We also agree that we wouldn't have had the recent restrictions if this government had done its job and secured vaccines and secured quarantine. But the best way to do this is to put this government behind us. That's what Australians are increasingly coming to terms with—that this is a government seeking a second decade in office who don't have an agenda for today, let alone an agenda for tomorrow. Perhaps the rebels in the government have a point because no matter what position they take, if they wait long enough it will be the government's position, because Scott Morrison had a different position last week and last month and last year from what he has today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has the consistency of mercury—dense, shiny, slippery, toxic and will change shape according to any situation. A prime minister who has no regard for what he himself said yesterday should be given no regard for what he says today. He said, 'We're at the front of the queue,' and we weren't. He said, 'It isn't a race,' and we know that it was. He said electric vehicles would 'end the weekend'. He said he supported Clive Palmer challenging border restrictions. He said 'Shanghai Sam' 17 times and then denied it. On Monday, he said he texted me that he was going to Hawaii, then he doubled down, then an hour later he had to stand at the dispatch box and say, 'No, I didn't,' when he realised that, maybe, there was a bit of evidence there. He should be aware about text messages because he's party to leaking them, as we know, from world leaders. He thinks that that is the way in which you secure relationships on the international stage. But the fact is that when I receive a text message from someone, like all decent people of integrity, I keep them private. The only reason why anyone knows there was any text message at all is because he went on 2GB live from Hawaii and told people; once again setting a precedent for the Macron incident. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PM did then return and he went to Cobargo, where he falsely claimed he had a long conversation with Zoey Salucci, which wasn't true. We recall the dreadful message of the guy who tells us he supports choice forcing people to shake his hand. I say this: I've never had to force anyone to shake my hand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My mum had a great saying: you can lock your door from a thief but you can't from a liar. This government is so focused on the photo op there's never a follow-up. It's smirk and mirrors. They're incapable of imagining a better future, let alone creating one. They act like an opposition in exile sitting on the government benches.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side have a plan to build back stronger after COVID, with our National Reconstruction Fund to support the transformation of existing industries and new industries; our plan to make Australia a renewable energy superpower, cleaner energy and cheaper energy that will enable us to build things here, and rebuild; advanced manufacturing—to build manufacturing in areas like trains, defence and agriculture; our 10-point Buy Australian Plan; and our fixing of the National Broadband Network. This mob that say they support technology are the same mob that thought they should replace the fibre rollout with copper—with copper! It says it all about them. We'll train Australians for those jobs by creating Jobs and Skills Australia, supporting TAFE, supporting new infrastructure by having a fair dinkum Infrastructure Australia and not one that's just a place in which you appoint mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all of the jobs that we'll create, we'll create secure work. This week, we've introduced the 'same job, same pay' legislation. We have a range of other measures to close the gender pay gap, to fix casualisation and to look after people in the gig economy. We want no-one held back and no-one left behind. We will advance the universal provision of affordable child care. We will protect and defend Medicare as the key organisation behind our health system. We will fix aged care, which has been the subject of neglect by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll address issues like gender inequity in this country, including through women's safety with 500 new community workers, which we announced this week, and a family, domestic and sexual violence commissioner. We'll also make sure that women can't just be turned away in the way that they are en masse from housing when they're fleeing violence. We will allocate 4,000 of our housing future fund for women and children escaping domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also talk about what sort of nation we want into the future, a nation where we actually work together, a nation where we promote unity, a nation where we take people on that journey where we stop trying to divide. This Prime Minister sees every issue as an opportunity to divide Australians. Even when I just asked about the report into safety in the workplace that is this parliament, he sought to divide. I just wanted a copy of the report and to make sure that all the parliamentarians who participated get access to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll talk about what sort of Australia we want, and the Australia that I want is one that recognises the great privilege we have of living with the oldest continuous civilisation on earth here, First Nations people, and that's why we will implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, including a voice to parliament that is recognised in our Constitution—something that hasn't been advanced from those opposite, like the National Integrity Commission and so many other things they promised at the last election. It's always just  about the announcement and never the delivery for a Prime Minister who is just not up to the job.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  I've been involved in politics for just over a decade, and in that time I've seen many things, some good, some bad. But do you know what I see at the moment from that side of the House? I see arrogance. I see the arrogance of an opposition that thinks that they are just going to walk into the Treasury benches and take control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who can forget in the lead-up to the last federal election—it was the then opposition leader, the member for Maribyrnong, who sidled up to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Do you remember that, Deputy Speaker O'Brien? You may recall it. They were at a charity run, and he sidled up to the former Governor of California and informed him that he was going to be the next Prime Minister of Australia. You could tell from the look on Mr Schwarzenegger's face that he was shocked by that revelation. I felt that I could hear him thinking: 'Oh, my lord. I feel sorry for Australia if that is their fate.' Indeed, it wasn't to be the fate of Australia, because the then Leader of the Opposition's hopes and dreams were terminated. The Australian people terminated those dreams and their agenda of higher taxes and higher regulation at that election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see the same arrogance creeping into the debate in this House these days—indeed, in the last few weeks and months. Who could forget the portrait 'we are ready to govern'? It's the same thing. They think that it is their entitlement to waltz into those Treasury benches, that they don't have to submit any meaningful policies to the Australian people and that they are just going to be able to tax their way into whatever they want when they get into government. Well, the Australian people may yet have something to say about that. Just as the terminator gave the member for Maribyrnong that sideways look, I suspect the Australian people are still going to have a big say in what happens to the fate of the Leader of the Opposition. The reality is that this government has delivered for the people of Australia at a time when we have faced some of the biggest challenges we've ever had outside of wartime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of COVID, we have an enviable reputation. We've led the world in our COVID response and our COVID recovery. More than 85 per cent of the eligible population are fully vaccinated. We have been on the front foot to get the vaccines rolled out. Who could forget the great effort that was COVID Assist, with the men and women of our Australian Defence Force? They were on the ground all over our nation. They were everywhere in western New South Wales. I think that, when the history of this pandemic is written and people look back at what happened in not only western New South Wales but right around Australia, they will say it was those ADF pop-up clinics that turned the corner in so many communities, that got our communities vaccinated, that got the vaccine rollout turbocharged. We'll be forever grateful to those men and women of the ADF. But it was this government that made sure that that rollout happened, that our men and women of the ADF were on the ground to support our communities when they were at their most vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who could forget in the dark days that we had in the early days of COVID the lines we saw that snaked around Centrelink? I never thought I would see it. My office is opposite our local Centrelink office in Orange, and I couldn't believe the number of people, in particular, the young people, who were standing outside with looks of worry, distress and anguish on their faces. Then along came JobKeeper, which helped keep 3.8 million Australians in work. JobKeeper: let's call it for what it is. It saved the Australian economy from obliteration. JobKeeper saved the Australian economy from destruction. There can be no argument about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things I often get when I talk to my communities about JobKeeper and the economic impacts is that there's a great deal of gratitude and goodwill for what the Australian government achieved in terms of the COVID-19 response. Equally, I also get many people saying to me, 'Boy, I'm glad the other side weren't in charge when we went through this.' And isn't that the truth! Amen to that. So many business people, so many individuals, who have shown gratitude, know what's happening out there and they are grateful that we were able to, together, get through it. There's been a lot of pain, there's been a lot of suffering and there's been a lot of heartache on the way through, but we have come through this and we are getting through this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the Australian government has been there with them every step of the way, not only through examples like the men and women of the ADF on the ground but also through our world-beating economic response. Let's look at what's happening in housing. There are over 130,000 HomeBuilder applications, generating $30 billion of activity, and new house starts are at the highest in 20 years. We have delivered the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. Apprentices: we've delivered new wage subsidies for 170,000 apprentices on top of the 100,000 already supported, many of them young Australians finding their way in the workforce. We were there for them. JobTrainer provided funding to support 450,000 places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about defence and who is best placed to look after Australia's security, both now and into the future. The new AUKUS partnership is a watershed, momentous announcement in terms of our alliance partnerships. The announcement on the nuclear propelled submarines is also equally momentous. It will give Australia the best available technology. Wherever I have gone in my community, that has been widely acknowledged and widely accepted. It's very important to have cutting-edge technology in defence. If you look back to the days leading up to the Second World War, it is true that many of our democracies were not prepared. That's the cold, hard truth. They were not prepared. But Britain had one piece of cutting-edge technology in its favour in those dark days, and that was the Spitfire. That's what saved Britain. That's what kept Britain and her allies in the war. It was just Australia and the like-minded democracies that stood up against tyranny. We have to be prepared. That's what AUKUS is all about, and that's what this investment in the latest submarine technology is all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So many more areas of Australian life have been supported by us not only through COVID but through many different facets. We have invested $125.7 billion in Medicare over the forward estimates. That's an increase of over $6 billion since last year's budget. This is up 58 per cent from when the opposition were last in government. It's a 58 per cent increase. We have announced more than $36 million in innovative medical product manufacturing projects to keep Australians safe from COVID-19. We have extended telehealth consultations. That's been a game changer for regional Australia. We have waived childcare gap fees for parents, supporting working parents and keeping their children in child care. When they have had to keep their children at home due to the current COVID restrictions, we have been supporting not only childcare centres but families as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have delivered disaster funding, including in those parts of Western Australia that have been hit by cyclones. We have supported our veterans. I mentioned in the House today the important work of supporting our veteran community. We are immensely proud of our veterans, and rightly so, but the work to support veterans and their welfare never ends and never ceases. Today in question time I drew attention to the fact that the government spends $11.7 billion per annum on supporting the 336,000 veterans and their families, including free mental health care for life. But it doesn't cease. It doesn't end. It is an ongoing piece of national work. It is very important that we keep it going, and that's exactly what we are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also supporting Australian manufacturers with $800 million in funding to encourage collaboration on major job-creating projects as part of the $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy. We love manufacturing in country Australia, and we are going to continue to support it. Australians can trust this side of the House to protect their health, the economy and their jobs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  Australians deserve a Prime Minister and a government that are going to tell them the truth, act in the public interest and plan ahead for a strong economy and jobs growth. But, instead, what do we have? We have a tired, decade-old government, just about, led by a Prime Minister who has zero regard for the truth. He always puts his immediate political interests ahead of the national interest and simply has no plan for the future, nothing beyond what can get him out of immediate trouble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing says it more about the government failing to act in the interests of Australians than the communications portfolio. When Australians think of technology, they think about it as a positive. They think of it as transformational. They see possibilities. They see the future. They see the potential for equality of access to be achieved through ICT. In contrast, this Prime Minister and this cabinet only see technology as an instrument to exploit or invent political differentiation and tactically present voters with false choices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere is this better exemplified than with NBN. This government came in in 2013 and abandoned a fibre rollout on the dishonest premise their second-rate copper network was going to cost $29½ billion. What a surprise; that cost blew out to $41 billion, then $49 billion, then $51 billion and now $57 billion—basically double what they originally promised. It is a proverbial sushi train of cost blowouts served up by the most incompetent economic managers in living memory. Why? The abandonment of fibre was never about cost. It was always about politics. It is always about politics with this government. On one side, we had a particular technology, fibre, that just so happens to be favoured by most of the developed world. On the other side, they felt compelled to oppose it. Every time their multitechnology mix had a cost increase, they would invent a new set of untruths about fibre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a scam, and it was decimated on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> in February this year. We had a report citing leaked figures revealing the communications minister and his government wilfully misled the Australian people about the cost of deploying fibre. I said before that it's highly notable that since that time the minister has been unwilling to repeat his false claims publicly. What is that? That's an admission that the minister was not misinformed. It's an admission that he wilfully misled the entire time and he is a diminished figure as a result, just as this Prime Minister and his government are so diminished in the eyes of voters who understand technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID has demonstrated that reliable, quality, high-speed broadband is not a luxury; it is a necessity. Families need it, students need it, small businesses need it. That's why last week the Labor leader and I announced that, if elected, Labor will not only keep the NBN in public ownership for the foreseeable future but will use that time to expand fibre access for up to an additional 1½ million homes and small businesses. This policy will run fibre into the street and give every Australian who relies on a copper connection now the choice of having fibre connected into their home if they want faster speeds in that 1.5 million footprint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes the next decade should be one where Australia makes things here again and becomes globally competitive in growing industries such as advanced manufacturing. Our plan is in the national interest. It's focused on the future and about building better jobs, and of course relying on the highest-quality ICT. It is therefore no wonder that this government, in September last year, did the biggest backflip in public policy history by announcing, after racking up nearly double the cost of their second-rate NBN, that they would go back to fibre. How incompetent could these people be?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, it is not just critical infrastructure like the NBN where the Liberals play politics. The SBS and the ABC are national institutions that exist to serve all Australians in the public interest. Let's talk about their cuts. Tony Abbott promised there would be no cuts to the ABC or SBS. I'll tell you what their cuts to the ABC did: they forced the cessation of shortwave radio, cutting off the provision of content into regional and remote areas. Then we had a news report in 2018 that a Chinese station had taken over those frequencies. It says it all. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  It's always a pleasure to follow the shadow minister for communications. The member for Greenway and I both came into this parliament at the same time, in 2010. She would well remember having been a member of that Gillard and, later on, albeit for a small portion of time, Rudd government, under Labor and under the Greens, where not one single cent—not one zack—was spent on mobile phone towers. She would know that. She would remember that because she is now the shadow minister for communications. There wasn't a cent spent in the electorate of Page, nor Herbert, nor Grey, nor Barker, nor Parkes, nor Riverina, nor Cowper, nor Eden-Monaro—I can see Eden-Monaro over there—nor Macquarie. Not one cent was spent on mobile phone towers in any electorate in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, since we came to power in 2013, total investment of $875 million has been generated, working with telcos to deliver more than 1,270 new mobile base stations across Australia. I can thank the member for Parkes, largely, for a lot of that, because he was the minister for regional communications at the time. No thanks to those opposite, because they didn't spend a single cent, not one cent. Yet they come in here—I hear the member for McEwen carp about it all the time, about how he needs a mobile phone tower, and I hear other members opposite who represent peri-urban areas say that they need mobile phone coverage. Well, don't expect it if ever there is an Albanese-Bandt Labor-Greens government, because you won't get a penny for mobile phone coverage. Indeed, you will get it under us. You will get it under the Liberals and Nationals. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I well recall the sorts of things those opposite put in place when they were in power. I well recall 8 June 2011. It was a black day for the live cattle trade, when they just said 'no', on the back of a television program, to live cattle exports. All of those farmers and all of their cattle had backs turned on them by Labor and the Greens and the crossbench. I remember how hard that was for those farmers, how hard it was for those operators, how hard it was for the hardworking Aboriginal stockmen. Goodness knows if ever they got back into the trade when it was resumed. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instant asset write-off: the member for Parkes reminded me just a moment ago that he was driving from Lake Cargelligo, through the fertile valleys of the Riverina, back to his home base. He was driving back at night. He said all the headers were going, harvesting already. Many of those headers and harvesters and operations are due, thanks to good weather—</span>

                  </a>  Confected outrage, but I withdraw. He asked the Treasurer a question about jobs, about investment, about funding, about what we have done. These have been tough, difficult, challenging times, but the carry-on from those opposite does not resonate throughout the land. Small-business people are not thinking about what Labor is talking about. Mind you, they should be worried, because if Labor gets in there is $387 million worth of taxes just waiting. There's the sneaky petrol tax coming to a petrol browser near you. But look at the sorts of jobs that are in place now. There are more people in work now than there were pre COVID. There are certainly more people working now than there were when Labor was in power. One in eight manufacturing jobs were lost when Labor was in power. We're investing in apprenticeships, so we're investing in the future. We're investing in the instant asset write-off. We're investing in those businesses which keep our economy turning, whether they're in urban Australia or, indeed, in the powerhouse that you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker O'Brien, know well of regional Australia, because regional Australia has been fantastic during COVID, and it has been on the back of National Party and Liberal Party policies. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I rise to speak on the MPI on the government being accused of failing to act in the interests of Australians. It is a serious topic. To accuse a government of having their own self-interest rather than the national interest is a major accusation. We know that they have had major problems when it comes to acting on climate change, which the rest of the world know is in our interest. We are the driest continent. We know that we've got to look after farmers, a big source of our trade, so we do have to get that right. But what do we see? We have seen some activities from the government in the last few days that are particularly disturbing in terms of acting in the best interests of the Australian people. We know that we live in a time of great uncertainty. Not since the end of the Second World War, I would suggest, when Labor led the nation through a very difficult time, has there been such a convergence of circumstances. Our foreign affairs spokesperson, Senator Penny Wong, gave an address at the ANU the other day. In a brilliant speech, she talked about rising nationalism; fraying multilateralism; great power competition, where smaller nations can be crushed; emerging COVID strains; an ever-warming planet; and coping with a more assertive China. That's what I want to touch on today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know China is significant. So much of our minerals and our farm produce is exported to China. In light of these changes with a more assertive China—our most significant trading partner—we need to get the balance right. Australia, right in the middle of the Indo-Pacific, has significant connections with the rest of the world. We are in a growth part of the world and have lots of opportunities to use multicultural Australia as our link to trade opportunities, but we need to get the balance right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from reading the newspapers that some of those opposite want to beat the war drums in the lead up to an election. That is a very, very dangerous thing to do at any time, but in a world where we have some serious challenges it's particularly dangerous. We saw during the pandemic that something as simple as getting PPE organised can be complicated. Who knew that most of that came from a city in China called Wuhan? We know we've got to get the balance right when it comes to dealing with our trading partner. We know how important it is and that what goes on in this parliament is seen around the world. I was elected 14 years ago yesterday, and my first day was the apology, delivered by Kevin Rudd right there. That resonated around the world and let us have connections with countries in the Caribbean in ways that had not existed before, when they just saw us as a colony of the United Kingdom. Instead, we were able to reach out to countries in a way that we hadn't done previously. That all changed when Tony Abbott came in and had all of those opposite vote for knights and dames and all those other things that said: ignore Asia and the fastest-growing part of the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the other day we also saw the defence minister make a statement that was quite challenging. Normally, when it comes to talking about China and Taiwan, we talk about maintaining the status quo. That has been the Labor position ever since Gough Whitlam went off to Beijing, an event of which the 50th anniversary was in July this year. And that has been a bipartisan position. Both sides of the House have had that same position. But the defence minister came out and made some incredible statements, asserting that it would be 'inconceivable'—that's the word he used—that Australia would not join a war over Taiwan. That's completely out of step with our allies, the United States, and how they approach diplomacy. You've got to ask why he would say that. Why wouldn't he be sticking to preserving the status quo, as advocated by the Taiwanese leader, Tsai Ing-wen? That's what the Taiwanese leader advocates. So he's amping up the prospect of war against a superpower to do what? To win some jostling match for positions on the front bench? That is bizarre, crazy and dangerous. It's a tactic employed by irresponsible politicians who are desperate to hang on to power at any cost. That is not putting the nation's best interest first. That's putting your own self-interest first, and that is dangerous. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  Politics is not about what is going on in this place right now. Those opposite would like it to be where they're putting performance over people, tactics over the truth and antics over the interests of everyday Australians. Over here, we're standing up for Aussies, backing our sovereign capability and putting Australia's interests first. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere are we doing this more than in my community in Western Sydney, where we're focused on what matters most when it comes to jobs, infrastructure, families, small business and ensuring that we keep the cost of living low. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our community worked so hard during the pandemic, and some people in our community are shining through now. There's a little cafe I want to mention called the Blind Chef Cafe. Craig, who runs this cafe, is completely inspirational. He lost his sight in one eye to a tumour when he was a kid. He became a chef, and he lost sight in his other eye when his tumour returned in his 20s. He opened his cafe in the midst of the pandemic, and it was our support with JobKeeper and JobSaver that enabled him to push and fight through. It was a complete honour to take the PM out to meet Craig and his team just last week. He represents what we fight for in Western Sydney, the people who we fight for and who we want to do the best by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key thing that's happening in Western Sydney that the Morrison government is delivering, that the Morrison government is focused on when it comes to people over politics, is Western Sydney international airport. We have just announced the start of the passenger terminal, which is going to be a game changer not just for Western Sydney and my community but for our whole country, where we've got emerging industries, advanced manufacturing, medical industries and agribusiness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The future is bright for people in my community. Importantly, it is about creating local jobs. That's what we're doing in the Morrison government: creating local jobs for local people. We've already injected more than $100 million into Western Sydney businesses as part of the development of the airport. From cranes, plumbing and fencing to concrete, it is a nation-building project. Already, over half the people working on the construction of the airport are Western Sydney locals. That's because we're at the forefront of Australia's future. There is so much to look forward to—local jobs, local people. We're putting people first before politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also really excited about the fact that we are backing apprentices in Western Sydney in trades, particularly in manufacturing. Manufacturing in Western Sydney is at the heart of Australia's manufacturing. We have over 2,285 apprentices in Lindsay, and we've extended our wage subsidies to support even more. So I'm really excited about the future for our young apprentices supporting the growth of manufacturing in Western Sydney, where we have over 600 manufacturers employing over 6,000 people already, and I look forward to seeing that grow even further with the support that we're giving to back in our Australian manufacturers. There's never been a better time when we are so focused on Australia's sovereign capability. A number of manufacturers in my electorate are contributing to this, because we are hardworking, aspirational people in my community who are being backed in by the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic has been a particularly hard time for people in Lindsay, with lockdowns and particularly with mental health. I'm really pleased that one of my election commitments—a $14 million election commitment to have a Penrith Head to Health clinic—is shortly going to open and provide even more support to people in my community who are struggling with mental health issues, which is super important after this time that we've faced with the pandemic. So, in Lindsay, we're being backed by the Morrison government. We're delivering for them. We're putting people before politics. We're backing local jobs. We're backing local manufacturers. We're building Australia's largest infrastructure project. For me, this is what it's all about: backing local people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  We thought things were pretty bad when former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who promised no cuts to the ABC and SBS, no cuts to health and no cuts to education, did just that when he came to office. He cut every one of those things. He broke promises. We thought that was a new low in politics. But this country has never seen anyone quite like Prime Minister Morrison, a man who acts only in his own interests and does not act in the interests of all Australians. I'm very happy to spend the next four minutes and 15 seconds backing that up. Sadly, that will not be enough time to cover all the ways in which he has failed Australians, but let's give it a go. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we felt this most keenly in Macquarie—this failure to act in the interests of Australians—when the Prime Minister didn't show his face in my electorate when the fires were burning. In the Black Summer, the largest fire from a single ignition point was sending smoke everywhere and traumatising people as the waves of flames came, not for days, not for weeks, but for months, but the Prime Minister didn't make an appearance. He flew over us on his way to somewhere else. We didn't expect him to hold a hose—although former Prime Minister Tony Abbott was there early one morning at Hawkesbury RFS headquarters, ready to spend the day literally holding a hose. While I rarely saw eye to eye with Mr Abbott on policy, I thanked him for his support of my community in our hour, or months, of need. I had no cause to extend the same thanks to the Prime Minister, because he didn't show up—and not for the floods either. As far as I know, he still hasn't come to see, on the ground, the extraordinary damage in my electorate that occurred as a result of the fires and the floods—and the floods just this March gone. If he had, he would understand the fear that people have right now about the current rain and what it might do, and the fear that they have of a second flood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People feel that the Liberals are failing them right now. This is a Prime Minister who happily steps back from any responsibility. He is like your wilful teenage son who will deny he said or did something even when you can see the evidence on Instagram. He will not accept his part in things. He failed to give us the vaccines that we needed early and soon enough, and that has led to lockdowns across my electorate, across Western Sydney. He was responsible for the lockdowns that saw one part of Western Sydney treated so harshly and another part also in lockdown—our city divided. He failed to act in the interests of all the musicians, creatives and performers in my electorate when he decided that JobKeeper was not for them. He failed to act in the interests of university workers, staff, who either lecture and tutor or who work on the grounds or work in libraries. He failed them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's failed to act consistently in the interests of young people. He's doing as little as possible as late as possible to rein in climate change. He's put up the fees for students doing law, economics. communications, commerce and humanities. He has failed them. He's let TAFE be neglected, cutting $3 billion from vocational education funding and slashing the Education Investment Fund. He has done nothing to tackle the housing affordability issue that they face. He has failed to deliver a headspace for the Hawkesbury. These are all things young people need and care about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, at the other end, he has failed to act in the interests of people in aged care. Neglect—that sums up exactly what this government has done and continues to do. He is failing to act in the interests of people with disability who have a constant fear that the NDIS is going to be changed. When there are moves to change it, they're beaten but then, right behind, there is another move—just like waves crashing time after time onto the shore. That's how people with disabilities feel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other failures, but the thing with this Prime Minister is that he will never admit it. He will blame us. He will blame the states. He will blame anyone else rather than take responsibility.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity that this matter of public importance gives me to talk about the achievements of the Morrison government and, in particular, what's happening in my home state of South Australia. Earlier this week, the ABS figures showed that the South Australian economy is the fastest-growing in the nation, at 3.9 per cent. That's thanks to some of the excellent things that we as a government are doing in South Australia. But, even better still, there's so much more to come in the future. Those figures only take into account what is already happening, let alone what is going to be happening going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few areas I want to touch on—firstly, defence. South Australia is the defence state, and particularly we are the state of naval shipbuilding. We have had a very historic announcement in the last few months about the AUKUS deal and what that means for the future of submarine construction in South Australia. At the same time as the AUKUS announcement, we had the confirmation that South Australia will be the home of Collins class maintenance into the future, as well as the life-of-type extension to the Collins program, which is 1,300 jobs guaranteed in my home state of South Australia. I was thrilled to have the commitment that Adelaide is indeed the home of submarine construction now and into the future. As well as that, we have the AWD upgrade announcement. Of course, the AWDs were built in Adelaide, and the latest upgrades to the AWDs will also happen in Adelaide. That's coupled with the Hunter class program, which is ramping up with nine frigates to be built in Adelaide. In defence, this government is investing enormously in shipbuilding, and Adelaide is unquestionably the home of naval shipbuilding for Australia—for the Southern Hemisphere, frankly. That means thousands of jobs for decades to come into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have the Space Agency. This government has made a number of significant investment decisions in space, but also partnership decisions with the major space agencies around the world: NASA and ESA, the European Space Agency. We're already participating in some very exciting space based programs. The Space Agency is headquartered out of Adelaide. We're already seeing businesses in the space industry attracted to South Australia. Because the space agency's there, they see Adelaide as the capital of the space operations and industries of our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That also flows into cybersecurity and what's happening in cybersecurity, both with our government decisions and in the private sector. Again, we're seeing an enormous number of cybercompanies choosing to establish a base in Adelaide because they see Adelaide as the centre for the cyberindustry in this country into the future. That is an enormous growth sector. We all know how important cyber already is, but it's only going to be more significant into the future, and Adelaide is where it is at if you want to be in the cyberindustry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the creative industries, particularly film, I'm lucky enough to have the South Australian Film Corporation based in my electorate. We've had some significant productions in the last few years, most particularly<span style="font-style:italic;"> Mortal Kombat</span>, the biggest film ever made in South Australia. That was a Hollywood blockbuster supported by our government's rebate scheme, which helps support film businesses to come to Australia and undertake production here. We've got a bill that's been through this House, that's in the Senate now, that continues and enhances that into the future. I have one business in my electorate that's already hoping for and counting on the swift passage of that through the Senate. It's a novel position for someone to expect that the Senate will be hasty on that! Nonetheless, he's made a decision that that's going to pass. He's already signed deals to do more film production in South Australia. Again, that's an example of our government co-investing with businesses to create jobs and grow our economy in Australia, particularly in South Australia. The Lot Fourteen precinct is the heart of a lot of these decisions. In a few weeks time we'll have a major milestone at that precinct, with the sod-turning for the Indigenous art gallery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Things are really happening in all of these sectors because of the decisions that we're making. At the heart of that is the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund. A few businesses in my electorate have already been successful in applications to that program. That is us investing in future manufacturing and future jobs. It's an exciting time for the economy in South Australia, and that's thanks to the decisions of the Morrison government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I encourage the former Speaker, the member for Sturt, to encourage the passage of that legislation through the Senate. I know there are a lot of film production companies that are going to go to the wall if there's not a quick resolution of that, and there are some very commonsense amendments around. I encourage him to continue to see the passage of the bill through both places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're living through a once-in-a-century global pandemic. It's causing the greatest amount of inequality that we've seen in this country. But, instead of improving the lives of Australians, those opposite have indeed been making things much worse. One example is housing affordability. It's never been worse than it is right now. Many young Australians will never be able to afford a home, and it's this government's policies that have let that happen. This government doesn't do anything to help the next generation put a roof over their heads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this tired old government, we've seen wages go backwards—not even staying the same, not even keeping up, but actually reversing. Wages have gone backwards by about $700 a year, while fuel prices have gone up $900 a year. The interests of hardworking everyday Aussies, who are feeling this, hard, in their back pockets, have never been of less interest to those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite stuffed up the vaccine rollout unimaginably all year, leading to months-long lockdowns for most of the country and causing unimaginable suffering to people and their businesses, but you won't ever hear them take any responsibility for that. They'll talk about the mental health challenges that are there but never connect it to the businesses that have gone to the wall because of lockdowns. Businesses have gone to the wall because JobKeeper was ripped away too soon, because the government were too focused on making sure that it went to the top end of town—to those businesses that actually had increasing profits during that period. But, when they started getting called out for giving taxpayers' money away to corporations that did not need it, then they withdrew it, leaving high and dry the small and medium businesses that did need it to keep their employees employed and to keep liquid, to keep operating their businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, let's not forget that they're asking pensioners in their 90s to prove that they should be getting the pension and then threatening to put them on a cashless debit card. They're demanding that workers who may have been overpaid on JobSeeker or JobKeeper repay it, even if they're quite willing to do it if they just know what the situation is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These things come up because of these continual lockdowns. Whose responsibility were the lockdowns? It was those opposite, the federal government, who failed to bring in dedicated, proper quarantine—a lot of people forget about that—and also failed in the vaccine rollout. They failed with the communications plan about the importance of getting vaccinated.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we've seen a disgusting situation where misinformation thrives not only among those opposite but with the Prime Minister himself. That's had real consequences in the Northern Territory, including in my electorate with the people that I support. Life-threatening, dangerous misinformation is flourishing, including in our remote communities in the Northern Territory. The government are doing nothing to stamp out the malicious spreaders of misinformation who are preying on these communities, and it is an absolute disgrace.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that those opposite have got no problem at all being profligate with taxpayers' money. It's a slur they like to throw at Labor, but we've had sports rorts, car park rorts, endless pork-barrelling of marginal seats—and their own seats, of course—and the million-dollar blind trust. The Australian public's faith in our democracy is at an all-time low, because that's how this Prime Minister wants it. The rorting has been outrageous. They don't want a national integrity commission, which says everything you need to know about this mob.</span>

Let me take the opportunity to punt at the goal. Let's talk about how the government has acted over the course of this parliament and this term in the interests of Australians. On jobs, 1.6 million jobs have been created since 2013.

                  </a>  Fighting the virus? The death rate in the US and the UK is 50 times higher than that in Australia. On economic recovery, we're the first advanced economy to have more people employed than we did pre COVID. There are currently 74,000 more people in employment today than there were pre COVID, and our net debt is around half of that of the UK or the US. On small business, we've provided tax relief to 3.4 million businesses, and we've expanded the instant asset write-off. Spending on equipment has increased to its fastest rate in seven years. On housing, there have been 130,000 HomeBuilder applications, a program that those opposite opposed and decried. New housing starts are the highest they've been in 20 years. We've delivered the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme to make sure people who want to get into a home can get into a home. On apprentices, we've delivered new wage subsidies for 170,000 apprenticeships on top of 100,000 already supported and the JobTrainer fund to support 450,000 places.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On tax, we're providing relief to 11 million Australian taxpayers. They're getting up to $2,745 in relief this year alone. Electricity prices are down 13.2 per cent since December 2018. On emissions, those opposite want to pretend they're the friend of a low-carbon economy when they don't even have a target for 2030, but it's our government that has driven down emissions to 19 per cent lower than 2005 levels. It's the lowest level since 1995, and we're investing $20 billion on clean tech. We've got a record investment in infrastructure—our $110 billion commitment—which includes but is obviously not limited to Western Sydney Airport, Melbourne Airport Rail and the Bruce Highway. We're driving up exports. We've had the largest trade surplus since 1920. We've got new export deals with the Pacific, Japan, Korea and Indonesia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a more resilient Australia in response to the challenges of drought and bushfire. We have a stronger Defence Force. We've delivered on our commitment to grow the defence budget by two per cent of GDP. We're spending $270 billion over 10 years on defence capacity. On school funding, funding for schools has increased from $13.8 billion in 2014 to $23.4 billion in 2021. On better health care, funding for public hospitals has increased from $13.3 billion to $25.6 billion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say all of this because the Australian people are about to go through the exercise of contrast and compare. Well, that's our submission to the Australian people on what we've achieved. All they've got to go by is what happened under the last Labor government. Let me remind people who might be listening: there was the carbon tax; there was 'cash for clunkers'; there were overpriced school halls; there were pink batts that killed people; we saw defence spending at its lowest level since the 1930s; and the greatest shame of all, the greatest tragedy of all, was that we completely lost control of our borders. We ruined the Australian live cattle trade, and those opposite, quite frankly, didn't 'give a ship'. They gave not one commitment to build a ship in this country. They did not 'give a ship'—not one.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before those opposite say, 'That was a former government; we'll be better after Anthony Albanese,' the reality is that his great plan to get into government, other than saying absolutely nothing, was a national driver's licence with which you could drive from Melbourne to Sydney—newsflash: you can do that today—and a $6 billion commitment to give $300 cheques to people who'd already taken the vaccine.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  I would like to respectfully make a contribution to the debate on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021. From the outset, I'd like to say I'm not trying to approach this from any moral or religious perspective. I believe that, as legislators, we must consider the perceived benefits and risks associated with the proposed methods of mitochondrial donation. But we must also consider and weigh them against our obligations in terms of ethical perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that, for some Australians, the risk of passing on mitochondrial disease is far too high. It can prevent women from having healthy children. Understandably, women facing this prospect would look at any feasible approaches to lessen that risk. As with any pregnancy, I think it would be every parent's fervent hope and prayer that they would have a healthy child. Regrettably, at the moment, almost one child a week—somewhere between 50 and 60 children each year—is born with a mitochondrial disease in this country. Sadly, the prognosis for those children is not great. The fact is that most will die within the first five years of life. On those young people: I know I will be followed by the member for Macarthur, Dr Freelander, who has on a number of occasions treated young patients suffering from a mitochondrial disease, which he will inform the House about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others living with this disease will have a lower life expectancy and can suffer a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including loss of hearing and vision, multiple organ failure and heart problems. Clearly, this is something that should concern all of us. I agree with so many in this place that there must be an ethical and sustainable way of mitigating these risks, and that there is a need for a pathway for women living with mitochondrial disease to have children without the fear of passing on this debilitating disease. As legislators, we must balance what are seen as the possible benefits to humanity with the extent to which we are willing to compromise on our ethical obligations in passing a bill which will pave the way for these proposed research methods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the bill sets out a path for research into mitochondrial donation technology as a means of assisted reproduction technology. Secondly, the bill creates a pathway for mitochondrial donation to be legalised for clinical use. As the bill before the House stems from legislation in the United Kingdom, it is prudent to note that in that jurisdiction only two methods have been approved for research and subsequently for clinical use. The first of these techniques is called the maternal spindle transfer, which involves the extraction of a mother's nuclear DNA to be transferred into an unfertilised donor egg containing healthy mitochondrial DNA. This technique, despite objections from some, is one I can conceptually support, as it seems to follow a pathway for women suffering from mitochondrial disease to have a child without the needless destruction of human embryos, and only sees the discarding of an unfertilised egg. Whilst MST will, to some extent, still have an effect on the genetic code, as it does require a third person as the donor, I consider this approach to be more in line with modern-day IVF, which is a proven assistive technology—one which I would find very difficult to oppose, given that the other day I found a statistic which surprised me: one in 20 babies are born in Australia today through IVF technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also paves the way for research into four other techniques, three of which have not been approved in any other country or jurisdiction for licensed research. Today I want to focus on the pronuclear transfer, the second and more favoured approach in the United Kingdom and, as I understand it, here in Australia. This technique is vastly different from the maternal spindle transfer, as it requires the fertilisation of both the mother's egg, which has the mitochondrial disability, and the egg of a donor. It requires both those eggs to be fertilised. Once the mother's nucleus has been transferred into the donor's egg, which is at that stage an embryo, the mother's embryo that has the mutated mitochondrial DNA is then discarded. That is the part that I find problematic, as it requires the creation of two human embryos, with the full intention that one of these embryos will be destroyed at the end of the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Plunkett Centre for Ethics raised a concern about this, and it is quoted in the committee's report, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Treating an embryo merely as a means and not also as an end in itself violates the respect owed to embryonic human life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a view I actually share. To create a human embryo and then destroy it for the sole purpose of research is something that I just can't see as being ethical. To be fair, the report goes on to note that there are many other research techniques and procedures that involve the destruction of embryos. But, in my opinion, that in itself does not justify the creation and destruction of potential, viable human embryos as being a normal or necessary process of medical research. I do not believe it is proper or ethical to create and then destroy human life, albeit embryonic human life, even if it is the intention for alleviating, ultimately, the suffering of another. While I have less concern about material spindle transfer—and, in fact, would support research being undertaken in respect of that technique—I cannot, from an ethical point of view, support the approval of research into the practice of pronuclear transfer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should this bill be passed, I think there will also be an issue that could occur with respect to the limited supply of donor eggs. The type of technique proposed by pronuclear transfer requires a donation of both eggs from the mutated mitochondrial DNA as well as healthy eggs. My concern is that, where the access to supply of either of these eggs is limited, it could well result in a commercial incentive being offered to women and, inadvertently, the creation of unwarranted social consequences. In this scenario, I think we could be creating a market where women who are willing to give up their eggs at a cost would, realistically, be women from—how do I say this?—probably more socio-economically challenged backgrounds. I know that is not the intended outcome of the bill before us, but I suggest it could be a realistic one. I'm sure that it wasn't the intention of those who approved organ donations to create a trade in organs—and we know that that does occur. We know that occurs in China, the Philippines, Thailand and many other countries, and I know that a lot of that is illegal trade. So it is not inconceivable that egg donation would not follow a similar path.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this, the donation of feasible eggs is not a simple act. It's not like blood donation. It will require the donor to go through a hormone regime in order to donate the viable egg which is to be fertilised—and in the full knowledge that it is there to be destroyed. Other than supporting family, I do not imagine there will be an outpouring of women in the community ready to go through this type of treatment as simply an altruistic gesture.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  As 2021 draws to a close, I want to acknowledge the school leaders, teachers, students and their families across Fraser. Fraser's school communities have worked so hard to keep our young people engaged in education amid this pandemic and the necessity of homeschooling. As a parent, I know how much effort teachers have invested to deliver good, remote learning outcomes over the last two years and how much energy has gone into providing students with high-quality, individualised learning. I am so grateful to the principals and teachers of Fraser for their unstinting efforts and professionalism, and I hope that 2022 is an easier year for the learning and personal development of our young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last two years have particularly impacted on children and young people, whose schooling and extracurricular activities have been severely curtailed. As a result, it's a particular pleasure to recognise in this parliament today some of the recent winners of the Fraser Primary School leadership awards. This award is given to year 6 students who have made special contributions as leaders in their school communities during the course of the year. This year's winners include: Ruby and Rhea at St Theresa's in Albion for their positive approach to school life and enthusiasm for learning; Annie and Stephen of Glengala Primary School for being motivated, contributing to every lesson and consistently showing the school values of respect, responsibility and safety; Eunice and Amelie of Sunshine Christian School for their compassion, creativity, leadership and positive influence on others; George and Mia of Taylors Lakes Primary School for being resilient and considerate of their peers as amazing school captains; Mong and Andy of Albion North Primary School for always trying their best and for being helpful, responsible, considerate and deeply welcoming of other students; Adriana and Dylan of St Albans for always helping others, being great listeners and supporting their peers; Louanne and Renato of St Albans Meadows Primary School for being exceptional students and showing compassion while always thinking of others and exemplifying the values of the school; and Alisha and Alayna of Sydenham-Hillside Primary School, who excelled in all curriculum areas while displaying their schools values as exceptional school captains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to all of these worthy winners of the 2021 Fraser primary leadership awards, and thank you to all of their schools for nominating them. I hope for all of these students and for all of these school communities 2022 is an easier year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to highlight the outstanding work being done by the SDA and the TWU and, indeed, by unions across the world which are seeking to end some of the appalling working conditions and unacceptably low wages of many Amazon workers. As Black Friday sales begin in Australia and many other countries, Amazon workers will face undeniable pressure and stress to fulfil orders across the world and, of course, across Australia. The race to the bottom on wages and secure jobs is a global problem, and Amazon is a prime example. Amazon Flex drivers aren't even getting the minimum wage in many circumstances. They have few rights and are often pressured to drive dangerously overloaded cars to avoid being sacked on a whim. While profits soar for Amazon, which saw a doubling of its profits in the first half of 2021 compared to 2020, workers are often left with little or no pay rises and working long hours without breaks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the union for Amazon online retail work, the SDA has worked tirelessly to stop the Americanisation of wages in Australia and to improve working conditions. The TWU is also working hard to protect safe standards for transport workers who deliver Amazon's goods to their consumers. Thanks to the SDA and the TWU for their leadership in forming the Online Retail and Delivery Workers Alliance to protect workers in every step of the supply chain, a secure job with a fair wage does not have to be a thing of the past for Australian workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Low wages and poor conditions are deliberate design features of this government's economic policies which have resulted in falling household living standards, something unthinkable for generations preceding ours and the worst decade for real wages growth since the Great Depression. Unlike this government, the SDA, the TWU and the broader union movement will not stand by and allow working conditions to be undermined—nor will Labor members in this House. It's time to make Amazon pay.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I have to say, I farmed for 35 years. It's always challenging, and this year is proving absolutely no different. In my state and in my electorate after a wonderful start to the season, where, in particular, the June and July rainfalls were exceptionally good and the seasons seemed to be set up for complete success, August proved to be dry, September turned the tap off completely and October wasn't a lot better. That has caused some problems with the crops, and they're not as good as we had hoped, but there are some good crops around. Since November started, though, the season seems to be intent on making up the rainfall deficit. We've seen 70 to 100 millimetres of rain over the last two weeks across a substantial part of my electorate, including on my own farm. It's just at a time as the headers have entered the paddock. The quality of the crops was exceptional, and the yields, considering the season, were pretty good. We are now waiting to see just how much damage has been wreaked by the rainfalls across those broad areas as it dries out enough to get the headers back on the ground and assess the quality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole lot of other issues facing farmers at the moment, and increasing concerns are being shown around the supply lines on new machinery, parts and, more concerningly, the fertiliser and chemical supplies coming into the nation and their pricing. In fact, we've seen staggering price increases of anything up to almost 300 per cent on fertiliser and chemicals, and we've seen concerns about supplies. To give a bit of explanation: nitrogen fertilisers are largely made from gas, and most plants in the world—certainly where we get product from—are in Asia. In Asia and Europe, the gas price has increased by around 400 per cent. It is up to $40 a gigajoule or thereabouts, and that is driving the price of fertiliser higher and causing the producing countries to restrict exports to try and dampen the prices in their own jurisdictions. That includes China, but that is not an unexpected response. In Australia, the gas price is around $10 a gigajoule, and that is a result of the government's 'big stick' policies. Unfortunately, we don't have that manufacturing capacity in Australia, and our ability to produce nitrogen fertiliser is severely limited. That is a problem for farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Worldwide, there are more issues at stake. One of them is the supply of freight and shipping services. With COVID, people stopped buying services and have been on a consumer goods binge ever since. They've got money in their pockets. They're not eating in restaurants. They're not spending money on tourism. The one-way volumes of consumer goods have soared. There hasn't been enough back load on those containers, so those containers have been piling up in consumer countries and haven't been finding their way back. The shipping companies followed the best advice at the time—that trade levels were going to be slashed—and they took the opportunity to retire some old and pretty dirty ships, so there was a shortage of ships around. They've commissioned new shipping, but they're not out of the shipping yards yet, so there's a ship shortage. We've got problems on wharves, particularly here in Australia, where the maritime unions are causing concerns. There are bottlenecks around ports all around the world. There are all kinds of hold-ups on freight, and that is feeding through to the farmers' supply system, including on chemicals and on fertiliser.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>On fertiliser, I was asked by a farmer: 'We produce a lot of fertiliser in Australia. Why don't we hold that in Australia, much as other countries are doing?' In fact, we are fairly short. We produce about enough DAP, a couple of hundred thousands tonnes a year. We produce more than enough single superphosphate, and we export about two thirds of that capacity. But the big outlier is in MAP, where we produce about 162,000 tonnes but need nearly a million tonnes a year. We are a net receiver of fertilisers in a big way. These are real problems for farmers as they look at their books for next year. This shortage of freight capacity is feeding into the chemical market as well. As it rains, almost as I speak, at home, it's causing damage to the crops. It's also causing a whole raft of new summer weeds to grow, and it will require chemicals that are three times as expensive as they were this time last year to keep those summer weeds under control. To be fair, the rainfall will stop eventually. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I joined the Labor Party in the year preceding that election, because I saw that our government had lost touch with the issues that were important to Australians and was attacking the things that made Australia the great place that it was, attacking our social safety net and our system of wages that had made Australia a relatively egalitarian place, and I wanted to do whatever I could to be part of changing that. I wanted to knock on doors, to make phone calls, to hand out how-to-votes and let people know that we could have a government that cared, really cared, about the issues facing Australians, that cared about fairness and was forward looking.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are at a moment again like this in Australia, and, after being in parliament this week, I know we are at a very much more desperate moment with this government. We desperately need a new government. This week in parliament we have seen the Prime Minister fail to call out dangerous misinformation from members of his own government and then, in question time, make out like it's a big joke and that it was all about Labor. In the last sitting fortnight of the year, and quite possibly of this government's term, you would think they would be trying to get through big reforms or big ideas. But instead we're seeing bills introduced that are solutions in search of a problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing bills that are seeking to divide rather than unite Australians, bills that are all about politics and not about substance. This morning the government shut down debate on an integrity commission—a federal integrity commission that the government says it is committed to but has taken over a thousand days and still not introduced legislation. Instead of debating that, we have a voter suppression bill, a bill that makes it harder for Australians to exercise their right to vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that detests accountability and debate. This is a government that has no respect for our democracy, and that will be the legacy of this government: a tired government beset by division and scandal, with a wafer-thin policy agenda that governs only for their own political interests; a prime minister and government who thinks that a three-word slogan is the answer to the complex policy demands of governing; a government that always seeks to divide rather than unite; and a government that will always dodge responsibility but always claim credit, and who thinks that a photo op is always the solution but never follows through with the policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, every sitting week that I come into this place we see new lows, and this is a tragedy for the Australian people. For eight long years, this government has squandered Australia's advantages, tripled our debt, ruined our reputation on the world stage and thrown away the goodwill of its people. In this time, Australia, once a world leader, has gone backwards in rankings of global performance. We ranked last among 60 countries on climate change policy and 61st in the world for fixed broadband speeds. Australia ranks eighth out of 11 high-income countries for healthcare affordability. Educational outcomes have slipped, while we're ranked as more corrupt and have less trust in government. Household debt, as a share of GDP, is now the second highest of 43 countries, and we have the third most unaffordable housing market. One in six Australian children live in poverty. Australia is going backwards under the Liberals. We are being left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a government that has vision, that wants to see Australia leading the world, that wants to build back stronger and fairer as we recover from the pandemic. We need a government in touch with the needs of Australians, that will support innovation and make sure that no-one is left behind. And that's why a federal Labor government is more crucial than ever. An Albanese government will tackle climate change, return integrity and dignity to politics, fix the NBN, properly fund the public broadcasters, provide job security and stand up for Australians. The pandemic has shown us what is important and what is less important. What people in Australia and around the world need right now is hope, and it's there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>This is my message to Australians. For those who are worried about climate change and the world that they'll leave their grandchildren, Labor hears you. To those worried about how they'll never get into the housing market, Labor hears you. To those trying to keep a business afloat at home during lockdown with the world's worse internet speeds, Labor hears you. To those struggling to get into the job market or to find secure work, Labor hears you. To those trying to upskill, train and get a degree, Labor hears you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ALEXANDER:</span>
                  </a>  It is a wonderful time of the year. Christmas is approaching. Lights are starting to appear outside homes. Christmas shopping is imminent. It has only been six weeks since decorations appeared in the shopping centres! Most years we look at each other and think, 'Where did the year go?' Lockdowns have blended into lockdowns. Homeschooling has drudged on, and well-intentioned sourdough starters have been in the fridge now for so long they are becoming sentient and have started to look to move out! Einstein told us decades ago that time is an illusion, but only in the last two years has this proven to be our experience. So we come to the end of this year with a relieved sigh and optimism for the future. It's worth remembering that in November last year we felt similarly, before Christmas and New Year's were upturned by the Northern Beaches outbreak. While Bennelong wasn't locked down, the implications of gathering restrictions affected the Christmas plans of many in my electorate, especially the many large local families looking forward to their traditional gatherings. Thankfully, this year, our optimism is supported by data.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our vaccine rollout, after an admittedly slow start, fired up in the second half of the year, and now the nation is 86 per cent double vaccinated, and New South Wales is trickling towards 95 per cent single vaccinated. In Ryde, we have 93 per cent fully covered, which is an incredible figure. We couldn't have gotten here without an incredible amount of work from our doctors, nurses, pharmacists and everyone else who helped roll out the jab and manned our emergency departments and COVID wards during our biggest outbreak this year. Thank you to everyone who played their part in keeping us safe, and, of course, thank you to everyone who rolled up their sleeves to get the jab. We're opening shops, opening borders and reducing restrictions purely thanks to the huge numbers of people who have come out to get their jabs, so thank you. This means Christmas will be somewhat back to normal this year, and I for one can't wait.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ryde Rotary Carols on the Common is back again, although not on the common this year—how common! TG Milner is the new home for this year, and it promises to be a great event. I look forward to seeing the thousands of people who normally come once again able to congregate and sing together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another stalwart that is back for another year is my Christmas card competition. The cards are being printed now and will be coming out shortly. We had wonderful entries from St. Charles, Epping West, Ermington West, St Michael's, Putney public, Our Lady Queen of Peace in Gladesville and St Anthony's Catholic Primary School. Choosing a winner was very, very difficult. Every child who put in an entry was a winner. The finalists were Isabel Chan, year 1 from Epping West Public School; Olivia Payne, year 2 at Putney Public School; Annabel Debkowski, year 3 at St Charles public; Ryde's Isabel Nagwani, year 4 at Ermington West Public School; and Chloe Palmer, year 5 at St Michael's Meadowbank. But there can only be one winner, and I'm happy to announce that this year that goes to Annabel Debkowski from St Charles. Congratulations, Annabel, and make sure you keep an eye out for your card around the community. Thanks to every student who participated and the teachers who found the time to make this happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To end, I would like to thank everybody for their perseverance this year and wish everybody a very happy Christmas. Hopefully, this year you can spend it with friends and relatives, but, if you can't, because they live in faraway places—or in Perth in the country of Western Australia!—you can look forward to the rapidly approaching day when borders will open. Please remember those less fortunate nearby you too. They've probably had a pretty hard year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next year will bring a soggy La Nina January, an election and perhaps another COVID season, albeit a smaller one, hopefully, but that's a few months away. For now we can focus on things closer to home, and for the next few weeks we can raise a glass—or maybe three!—to our essential services, our neighbours and ourselves, smile and know that we deserve this festive season.</span>

                  </a>  Today marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and launches 16 days of activism. The theme is 'Orange the world: end violence against women now!' We know that one in three women in Australia have experienced physical violence, we know that one in four women in Australia have been sexually assaulted at work, and we know that, on average, one woman a week in Australia is killed by a partner or former partner. So ending violence now is not soon enough. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been plenty of words said in this place about ending violence against women. In 2018, after the shocking murder of Eurydice Dixon in a Melbourne park, then Prime Minister Turnbull said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Women must be safe everywhere—on the street, walking through a park, in their homes and at work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February 2020, many MPs, senators and staff gathered for a vigil after the terrible murder of Hannah Clarke and her three young children Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey. Prime Minister Morrison attended that vigil and he said, 'We must remember their names.' I do remember their names, but remembering the names of Hannah, Aaliyah, Laianah, Trey, Eurydice and the many, many other women who have been murdered will not prevent more women being murdered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Counting Dead Women project, by the antisexism group Destroy the Joint, which counts all female victims of violence, domestic or otherwise, at least 55 women died in 2020. Shortly after the murder of Hannah Clarke and her children in Brisbane in 2020, I called on the government to implement one of the priority steps in the Safety First in Family Law campaign. Launched by Women's Legal Services Australia and supported by more than 90 organisations, it's a simple change to the Family Law Act—a change to something that had been raised in many reports and inquiries as a danger to women and children. It's a change that costs nothing and could be done next week, but nothing happened. My calls fell on the deaf ears of this Morrison government. Not even after hearing of the terrible murders of Hannah and her children was this government moved to act. I introduced a private member's bill to make this simple legislative change that will save lives. So far, nine Labor members, one member of the Greens and two Liberal members have spoken in support of my bill and the simple change that it proposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage all Australians who are serious about preventing violence against women to please ask their federal MP to speak on my bill, to support this simple change that experts in family violence believe will make a difference and will make women and children safer. Words won't make a difference, but action will. My private member's bill won't prevent all violence against women—I'm not suggesting that—but it will make some safer. But there is, of course, much more to be done. Women fleeing domestic violence should have access to safe refuge. Shelters for women and children should be properly staffed and funded. More community sector workers should be available to help women fleeing violence. Women's safety should be a national priority, and Australia needs a family, domestic and sexual violence commissioner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to action and bringing down the rates of violence in our community. Labor have already announced that we will invest in safe and affordable housing and 500 new community sector workers. We know that violence against women is a national crisis. We know that women are subjected to violence every day. We know that women are sometimes not believed when they say that they have been subjected to physical or sexual violence. I was a member of the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System, which has just tabled its final report. The committee made 52 recommendations to improve the family law system. The committee also made an important finding that false allegations of violence are not prevalent within the family law system, and that was a unanimous finding of the whole of the committee—including the deputy chair of that committee, Senator Hanson, who has been very vocal about her view that women lie about domestic violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is great at announcements. They know how to use words, but too often they follow up with nothing. Words are nice—I'm a writer; I love words. But what Australian women need is action. Today begins 16 days of action. Let's see what it takes for the Morrison-Joyce government to actually eliminate violence against women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My private member's bill is being debated in parliament again next Monday, just four days away. Let's see if any members of the coalition government will even bother to speak on it. I'm not saying they have to support it, but surely they should join the debate and speak to that particular piece of legislation. It is a private member's bill, but it makes a simple change.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TONY SMITH:</span>
                  </a>  As we know as local members of parliament, a community's greatest asset is its people. In the electorate of Casey, which I am privileged to represent, one of its finest was the late Don Parsons, a person who I worked alongside on many community projects and who became a very close friend. He was born in Tasmania in 1947 and obviously spent his youth there, but at the age of 15 he enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy. He served for 34 years in various posts, and also spent time with signals intelligence in the United Kingdom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After retiring from the Navy, he went into small business. He ran a cafe in the electorate—a cafe with a naval theme. He raised his family: his son, Ashley; and his daughter, Talia, who I know very well. He later served for many years in the community as a justice of the peace and a bail justice, but it was in his role as a member of the Lilydale RSL that I got to know him incredibly well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, he was part of a group that took over the leadership, and he demonstrated great community commitment and incredible passion right across his time there, particularly with the Centenary of Anzac, which he instinctively realised was a unique time to shine a light on those stories in a way that we had never been able to do. He was instrumental in getting a number of local war memorials and local military history publications completed, and many a time we stood together, as members in this House will have done as well, unveiling and launching these projects. The electorate of Casey is the Yarra Valley, Dandenong Ranges and the outer suburbs. Sometimes we launched these in the rain and sometimes with the sun beating down upon us, but Don was always there and he was always there leading the RSL.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I will remember most about Don, who passed away suddenly last year—and I will come to that; I haven't had the opportunity to speak in this House on this matter—was his being instrumental as a leader, together with local historian Anthony McAleer, in deciding that they would have a ceremony on the 100th anniversary of the death of every local soldier in the Lilydale and Mount Evelyn areas—on the day, a century after those locals lost their lives in World War I. Sometimes three or four of us were there. Sometimes family members had travelled for many hundreds of kilometres to be there. Sometimes schools turned up. He did that 45 times, just to stop and pause on the centenary of the death of those soldiers, reflect on their lives and lay a wreath. It was during those times that I really got to know him as a close friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He attended Anzac Day in 2020 with his daughter, Talia, to lay a wreath during lockdown, and died not long after, suddenly, at the age of 72. He was part of my local Anzac essay prize for local schools, and it's quite fitting that the committee decided that, following his passing, that prize would be renamed in his honour. I pay tribute to him. I miss him as a friend. I pay tribute to his family, who I understand are listening today. I wanted to make this contribution here in this House, on his behalf and on behalf of his family, for a community that he served so well.</span>

I remember in my childhood listening to Andrew Olle doing interviews with political figures on both sides and he had an uncanny ability to say the word 'Mm' in a way that indicated that he'd heard you but didn't necessarily agree. Those conversations between Andrew Olle and Paul Lyneham really shaped my view of politics growing up. I was extraordinarily proud, watching Emma Alberici quiz Sergey Lavrov on the ABC. And all Canberrans were thankful, when bushfire smoke shrouded our city, for the constant stream of information that came from the ABC with Dan Bourchier and his team even relocating outside the studio when they were inundated with bushfire smoke. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Triple J and triple J unearthed have provided musical opportunities to countless young Australians. In my childhood, when we lived in Indonesia, Radio Australia was one of the key ways that many Indonesian villagers got information. ABC Online has spread information using new platforms. ABC's data journalism is setting new standards, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> constantly sets the agenda.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet the ABC is under attack from conservatives—or people who call themselves conservatives but really don't understand what true conservatism means. True conservatives would be proud of the fact that it was a conservative government that founded the ABC—the Lyons government. True conservatives would understand the value of institutions. True conservatives would recognise the difference between a national broadcaster and a state broadcaster. This government is perpetrating the old view taken by Grahame Morris towards the ABC that it is, as he put it, 'Our enemies speaking to our friends.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  I'm glad we clarified what a conservative is. This October marks National Mental Health Month with the campaign being of particular importance during a pandemic which has placed a significant strain on mental health. Many people in Mackellar have sought to help others throughout lockdown, recognising the needs of vulnerable community members and volunteering to help them in various ways. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One person making a big difference is Avalon local Jason Partington who is the founder of the Making Meditation Mainstream organisation. Jason started the organisation after attending a free event for men which encouraged them to open up about mental health. The high number of participants led Jason to realise he could use his expertise in meditation to help communities which have increasingly faced escalating suicide rates and mental health challenges. With 22 years of meditation experience under his belt, Jason began sharing his knowledge about the benefits of meditation, hoping to help those struggling with depression, anxiety and loneliness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jason began the Meditation for Men course which provides an opportunity for men to discuss mental health and learn how to easily incorporate meditation into their daily schedules. When the course started in early 2018, it involved 10 men and has since grown into the hundreds. It has also reached beyond the Northern Beaches with locations in Newcastle and elsewhere along the east coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jason also founded the Making Meditation Mainstream movement, which forms groups on beaches to participate in a free 20-minute meditation. It now consists of 20 groups and has gone global, with one group in the UK and another in Switzerland—Switzerland, of course, being famous for its beaches! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the success of 28 for TWENTY EIGHT in 2020, Partington and his team ran the initiative again in 2021. It encouraged participants to meditate for 10 minutes each day over the first 28 days of October. Throughout the past year, organisations such as Lifeline have recorded a massive 25 per cent increase in support calls. Participants of 28 for TWENTY EIGHT will pledge $28 to support Lifeline, which is the same amount it costs Lifeline to answer a call from someone in need. It is fantastic to see community members such as Jason Partington going the extra mile and utilising their skills to equip others with the tools to tackle mental health issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage members of Mackellar, the greatest community in Australia, to support the 28 for TWENTY EIGHT initiative this month, and continue to think about ways to support vulnerable members of the community who face particular challenges at this time.</span>

Right across the world, one in three women will have experienced abuse in their lifetime: one in three. That figure has escalated during times of humanitarian crisis and during times of conflict. According to UN Women, during the pandemic, two in three women reported that they, or a woman that they know, experienced some form of violence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that violence towards women is an obstacle. It's an obstacle to achieving equality. It prevents young girls from opportunities for education. It holds women back from financial and economic security, and it perpetuates ongoing conflicts, preventing peaceful outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we are not immune. According to Our Watch, one in three women in Australia has experienced physical violence since the age of 15. We have, as a nation, mourned the horrific murders of women and their children at the hands of their intimate or former partners. Women in Australia have marched in the streets, calling for an end to the violence. And we know that when we raise our voices, when we shout 'Enough', when we take to the streets and when we demand to live in safety, in our homes, in our streets and in our workplaces, we know that when we speak out and when we speak up that's the only way that we're going to make change.</span>

Today, I am launching 'Conversations with blokes' as part of the 16 days of activism. It's a series in which I sit down and I talk to men about how they talk about violence against women. My first video is with the man I most admire, my husband, and we'll sit down and have a conversation about how and whether he broaches the subject of violence towards women with his mates, amongst all the conversations about ice hockey and car racing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  National Water Safety Day is on 1 December. This year the day will once again be focusing on championing water safety. The highest number of drowning deaths happen in the summer. Last year 34 per cent of total drowning deaths occurred in summer and, tragically, there was a 20 per cent increase in drowning deaths across Australia. Males are drastically overrepresented, accounting for 80 per cent of all drowning deaths. This is an issue which is of vital importance to my electorate because the entire western side of my electorate, over 16 kilometres of it, is the most beautiful coastline in the country, if not the world. The beautiful stretch of the Indian Ocean from Mosman Park to Trigg Point, which is a new addition with the changing of our electoral boundaries, is a destination for so many people, not only those in my electorate but those from all over the city and state and, when the Western Australian borders permit it, from around the country and the world as well.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our oceans and beaches are absolutely beautiful, but we know that there are dangers, even for the most experienced swimmers. I want to pay my respects and say thanks to the surf lifesaving clubs, and their volunteer members, within my electorate. There are seven brilliant, vibrant clubs: Cottesloe, North Cottesloe, Swanbourne Nedlands, City of Perth, Floreat, Scarboro and, now, Trigg Island. Our clubs have a long history of patrolling our beaches and supporting our community. In fact, the surf lifesaving movement in Western Australia started at Cottesloe Beach in 1909. These clubs do all that they can, voluntarily, to keep us safe at the beach but they do need us to do our part as well. This means we should take up the National Water Safety Day challenge and remind people to do the following: swim at patrolled beaches and between the red and yellow flags, wear a lifejacket if boating or fishing, avoid alcohol and drugs in and around water, and supervise children at all times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also need to note that the Curtin electorate clubs have a history of strong leadership and a strong track record of producing outstanding surf sports athletes. This was recognised at the recent annual Surf Life Saving Australia National Awards of Excellence, where Trigg Island surf club was named Australia's top surf club for 2021. This national award recognises an outstanding achievement in club development that results in Surf Life Saving Australia clubs providing safer beach and aquatic environments for the community. Given that there are 315 affiliated surf lifesaving clubs in Australia, this is without question a huge accolade and one that is richly deserved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  Make yourself comfy, Madam Deputy Speaker, because I'd like to tell you a story. It's a story about what I'm hearing around my electorate. At only 109 square kilometres, Moreton isn't a large electorate, but it is certainly a diverse electorate covering many suburbs. This month I've spent a lot of time in one of those leafy suburbs, Sherwood. Sherwood is part of what locals call 'the peninsula'. It's a green suburb with beautifully renovated Queenslanders, tidy gardens and some very impressive trees. Spending a month in a suburb means a lot of doorknocking and phone calls, and walking the streets and talking to as many locals as possible. Sure, we can take note of what national polling and the pundits tell us, but nothing gives us a better idea of what's going on politically than actually talking to real voters about what matters to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy Speaker, you might think it's strange that I'm telling you this story, because I tend to leave my doorknocking stories for TikTok—and, yes, I am cool enough to be on TikTok, apparently!—but this story is important, because it's a true story about Prime Minister Morrison in my electorate. Before the last election, when I held a community barbecue in Sherwood after the same process, people were lining up to tell me how angry they were about Labor's previous franking credits policy. I was there with the state member, Mark Bailey, and, I can tell you, he was pretty quick to palm off those cranky voters on to me, and rightly so. In 2021, Sherwood is a different story. People were lining up to give me their opinion about the Prime Minister. This time around all people wanted to talk about was how disappointed they were in the member for Cook. It wasn't so much that the Prime Minister keeps fobbing off responsibility to, basically, anyone who walks past his door but that no-one now believes a word he says. This might be good for me, Madam Deputy Speaker, but it's bad for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing is, unlike the Liberal and National parties, people in Sherwood care about our planet. They know that when the Prime Minister says that Australia is 'meeting and beating our climate targets' the only target we're actually meeting is the coalition's target to do nothing on climate. The Deputy Prime Minister made this clear at his coal-train train-wreck interview the other day, and this was crystallised during COP26. First, there were all those days of 'would they or wouldn't they commit to net zero'—and, remember, that was the absolute minimum that this nation could do. Then he went to COP26 and promised to do hardly anything, when the whole point of COP26 was to ramp up our action, not reinforce our inaction. And just when Australians thought the Morrison government had signed up to lifting its 2030 target—on the very same day—the government said it wouldn't agree to lifting that target. Confused? So is everyone in Sherwood. I get that trust in politicians is an issue, but the Prime Minister has taken this to the next level, especially when it comes to climate and establishing a federal ICAC. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  A few years ago I was contacted by a local charity called Youthsafe. They do good work in the community to prevent unintended injury to young people. They take a holistic and wide-ranging view of safety, focusing on everything from road safety to risk-taking behaviour and highlighting the main causes of harm in teenagers and young people. Their chief executive, Warren Johnson, works tirelessly and intelligently to get their messages out there and to help save lives and livelihoods. But they had a problem relating to designated gift recipient status. DGR is common in Australian charities, and many charities use it to incentivise donations that people can claim back at the end of the financial year. We also know that many charities don't get it. We expect to claim back money donated to a health charity, but not a political donation. But we don't often think about what separates the two. Some types of charities automatically get DGR—educational institutions and fire and emergency services, for example. If you don't fit inside these groups, often for fairly arbitrary reasons, you need to apply to the minister for special acceptance. Youthsafe fell into this category. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, Youthsafe don't need DGR to attract donations. At the time, they raised very little money from donations and weren't seeking to change this model. Instead, they wanted to apply for grants, which is where the story gets interesting. Many grants are only applicable to charities with DGR status, as if DGR status confers legitimacy on a charity. Without DGR, Youthsafe couldn't apply for grants and were staring into a financial abyss. I'm delighted to say that we were able to get DGR status for Youthsafe. But it wasn't easy. It took four years, six ministers and a lot of lobbying. Treasury doesn't like to give DGR status easily, as it can be a drain on taxpayers. That's an understandable concern, but not one that applies here. We need to create an indicator for a charity's legitimacy that is not also bound in financial or other gains. It makes sense for rules to insist on certain markers to be met before conferring a grant. But having that marker be something that locks out legitimate charities makes no sense. In this case, all's well that ends well. But I'm concerned that there are other groups out there in Youthsafe's predicament that are not lucky enough to have their stubborn persistence or a leader like Warren. We could be seeing worthwhile charities going to the wall over a tiny bureaucratic tick box, leaving the people who depend on them behind to fend for themselves. This must be a simple fix, but for now congratulations to Warren and his team at Youthsafe. Thank you for the very good work you do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I rise today to talk about the crushing crisis of housing affordability and how this government has fallen asleep at the wheel while allowing young Australians to be completely priced out of the market. Before COVID, buying a home was as hard as it had ever been, something simply out of reach for most Australians. House prices are stubbornly high, and the bubble that everyone talked about seemed to be made of iron. There were no signs at all of any burst—in fact, it's been the opposite. When the pandemic started the predictions were that prices would fall. Instead, prices have accelerated. The talk was that the lack of foreign investment snapping up our housing stock would provide young Australians with a big opportunity to get into the market. But that hasn't happened. The median Sydney house price pre COVID was $1 million. Ten months into the pandemic that same house would put you back an extra $300,000—$300,000 in 10 months. Sydney was the worst, but we saw similar figures around the nation, including here in Canberra. Over COVID, the typical Australian house price has climbed by more than 20 per cent. In Canberra, prices have risen by 38.4 per cent. Houses have been appreciating at a staggering rate of $720 per day. Canberra is now second only to Sydney when it comes to capital city house prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the government done to address this? Absolutely nothing. They are consistent in their inaction. The government's policies are woefully out of date. The government's First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, which is supposed to allow 10,000 first home buyers the opportunity to put down a deposit of as little as five per cent, is completely out of step with the reality of house prices. In Canberra, to be eligible for the scheme, the price of the property must be below $500,000. The problem is that the median house price in Canberra is more than $1 million and rising fast. A quick search on Domain shows that there are exactly zero houses in my electorate under $500,000. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And how can a young person even think of saving up for a deposit when their rent is skyrocketing and their wages are stagnant? Rental stress is at a record high, and there is no sign of any improvement. Real wages over the past year have fallen 2.1 per cent. So wages are falling, property prices are through the stratosphere and rent has become crippling. I have written to the Minister for Housing about this crisis and specifically regarding the unjust caps on the first home buyers deposit scheme, but I am yet to get a response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, Labor will act to make housing more affordable and less of a burden on Australians. We'll start by establishing a $10 billion off-budget Housing Australia Future Fund to build 20,000 social housing properties and 10,000 affordable housing properties. Australia deserves a government that cares about housing affordability, yet under the coalition the great Australian dream is now impossible to achieve. What a nightmare.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="E09" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I want to talk about two very important milestones in my community in 2021: a man who made it through his first century and is embarking on his second and a local organisation that's joining the growing third-century club of Parramatta.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just before lockdown, I had the honour of joining the celebration of Eric Tweedale's 100th birthday. Eric is famously Australia's oldest living Wallaby. He was drafted into the Wallabies in 1946, after serving in the Navy in World War II, and played prop-forward—front-row forward—for Australia until 1949. In Parramatta, he is best known for inspiring generations of our young people to play rugby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born in England, Eric moved to Australia with his family when he was three. They settled in Merrylands. He went to Guildford Public School and then Parramatta Intermediate School on the site that is now Arthur Phillip High School. He played his first game of rugby on Cumberland Oval in 1937, and at 17 he was selected to play for Parramatta, now known as the Western Sydney Two Blues. He would play for the club on and off for the next 21 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Eric retired from playing, he took up coaching and was instrumental in setting up junior rugby in Parramatta. As a coach, Eric wasn't focused on winning. It was all about having a go. The strength of the game in the middle of rugby league heartland is a testament to his influence on generations of Two Blues players. This year, their home ground in Granville was named the Eric Tweedale Stadium in his honour. I want to wish Eric Tweedale a very happy 100th birthday once again and thank the Merrylands RSL Club and the Western Sydney Two Blues for allowing me to join the celebrations earlier this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The year 2021 is the 200th anniversary of Paramatta Mission. It's been an extraordinary two centuries. Parramatta Mission has been serving my community since Parramatta's first Wesleyan chapel was founded on Macquarie Street in 1821. Today, they do the work that nobody else does. No matter who you are or what you are going through, you can find a space at Parramatta Mission—a safe one. Their Meals Plus service provides hot meals Monday to Friday, more than 46,000 meals every year. Anyone who comes in for a meal can also access laundry and shower facilities and get help with legal and financial issues, Centrelink and housing. I've used their services many times when a person has walked into my office. They are the ones you go to for immediate help. Most importantly, they can find someone to talk to who will listen without judgement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all the amazing staff and volunteers at Parramatta Mission, who do amazing work in my community every day. We would not be the community we are without Parramatta Mission. Congratulations on an extraordinary first two centuries. I know that you will absolutely rock your third century.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  Born in 1949 in Persia, the Gold Coast's very own shining star is who I would like to speak about today. He came from nothing—a familiar story on the Gold Coast, where the entrepreneurial spirit was born and resides. He studied at the University of Graz, graduating with a master's degree in architecture in 1979. His family arrived in Australia in 1981, and he initially started a business selling carpets with his brother, Sep. He began his development career with a single house and rose to become Chairman of the Sunland Group, where, among many other developments, including Palazzo Versace, he built the tallest residential tower in the southern hemisphere—Q1, a sister for the one he built in Dubai.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He and I have a great deal in common. We have a passion in our hearts for Surfers Paradise, for the future of its regeneration as the face of Gold Coast tourism and for the future of its residents and visitors. We have a passion for our community, and we care deeply, as does his wife, about our community on the Gold Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abedians' contribution to Moncrieff and the wider Gold Coast community is to be commended. Through the Abedian Foundation and its scholarships for 80 students per year coming into Gold Coast universities, including my own alma mater—Griffith University—and Bond University, they are changing people's lives. He's received an Order of Australia and the keys to the Gold Coast city, and last Saturday, at the Star, the Gold Coast business community came together to induct him into the business excellence hall of fame. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Soheil Abedian is a good man. He's a gracious man. He's a great man. He's a man of faith—the Baha'i faith—a man of courage, a man of great principles, a man of determination and a man of compassion. I congratulate him, his wife, Anne, his children, Sahba, Mona and Tom, and his nephew, Khian, for the great honour that the home of the entrepreneurial spirit has bestowed upon Soheil Abedian AM.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">):</span>  The ABC and the SBS are our treasured and trusted independent broadcasters. They are not only a source of reliable news; the ABC, in particular, provides Australian voices, Australian faces and Australian stories to us and to our region, and for many locals in Dunkley the SBS is a portal to the rest of the world. That's why it is so important to provide certainty for these national broadcasters with five-year funding terms, which is exactly what an Albanese Labor government would provide, to improve their capacity to innovate and plan within the diverse ecosystems they support in education, screen production and international broadcasting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have a five-year funding commitment in addition to our previous commitment that an Albanese government will reverse the Prime Minister's cuts of $83.7 million to the ABC. We must bolster the independence and stability of our national broadcasters as a guard against political interference in Australia's democratic institutions, where misinformation has the capacity to undermine public order, health and safety. The ABC and SBS are trusted sources of news, information and entertainment for all of us. I hear that day in, day out from people in my electorate of Dunkley. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We face political, social and economic instability at home and abroad and we have to make sure that Australia's instruments of nation building, democracy and culture remain strong, now and into the future. That includes independent public service media that holds power to account on the behalf of the Australian people. Governments of all stripes and colours being held to account by independent public-service media is fundamental to a functioning democracy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Liberal Federal Council voted to privatise the ABC, I'm proud that the Labor Party is united and speaks as one when it comes to the importance of our national broadcasters. We will protect the ABC and SBS as independent public broadcasters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For my community of Dunkley, arts and culture are at the heart of who we are. My recent arts and culture roundtable in Dunkley with the Labor shadow minister for the arts included representatives from Monash University, local musicians, actors, writers and film—short and long—producers. It included the Stellar Short Film Festival, the Monash University education department and BAM Arts, where people with disability dance and sing and find themselves. Universally, the message was this: we have to have a better way of funding local community arts organisations and supporting individuals and groups to make our community better. And that's exactly what I'll keep fighting for.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  My electorate of Barker spans 64,000 square kilometres and sits between the Adelaide Hills and the eastern states. There are four highways that connect Adelaide to the eastern states and therefore run through Barker: the Sturt Highway, which takes you through the Riverland; the Mallee Highway, which takes you through the Mallee; the Dukes Highway, which goes down to Mount Gambier; and the Princes Highway, which follows the coastline. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sturt Highway and the Dukes Highway are major heavy-vehicle transport routes and are a vital part of Australia's infrastructure network. The network, officially known as the National Land Transport Network, is crucial for transporting goods in South Australia. However, the Sturt and Dukes highways do not allow for the use of larger, high-productivity vehicles. This is a huge impediment for our freight industry, as existing truck limits and access constraints affect 88 per cent of South Australia's road freight. This is constraining productivity, and it's holding back progress. The high-productivity vehicles I speak of are capable of carrying 34 per cent more freight per vehicle. This would obviously mean fewer vehicles would be required on the roads to transport the same amount of freight. Not only does this reduce the cost to transport operators; it increases safety for all road users, and, in an increasingly carbon constrained world, it reduces the industry's carbon footprint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure Australia has listed the South Australian high-productivity vehicle network access, which includes the Sturt and the Dukes highways, as a priority initiative of the Infrastructure Priority List. Infrastructure Australia proposes improving mass limits and duplicating lanes on the Sturt and Dukes highways. I can't concur enough. It's time that we look to upgrade the Sturt and Dukes highways into the 21st century. The Truro bypass is a fantastic start, and I commend the government for the $202 million investment in this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also welcome the $143 million infrastructure package that includes three overtaking lanes for the Riddoch Highway. These overtaking lanes will go a long way to making the Riddoch Highway safer for all, but, quite frankly, these kinds of approaches are like putting bandaids on bullet wounds. There's a much bigger long-term demand, which is the full duplication of the Sturt and Dukes highways. That's the real fix. The duplication of these important transport routes needs to be prioritised and included in the federal government's 10-year infrastructure investment pipeline. I'm here to give notice to the federal government and the state government that I'm going to pursue this outcome with vigour. I spend too much time on the roads. I see too many accidents. The duplication of these highways is the answer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I rise to speak on behalf of the many South Australians who were left waiting for months and months without an answer from the state government, the Marshall government, about whether they could come home. Over months I was contacted by hundreds of South Aussies stuck on the other side of the border. These South Australians, who, for many valid reasons, had to go to New South Wales or Victoria before the lockdown, did the right thing by applying for permission to return. They expressed their willingness to comply with all the requirements, yet the South Australian authorities kept them waiting for months with no response to their emails or their phone calls. We tried on their behalf; again, there was no response. They were left waiting for months and months. They didn't even have the decency to reply to the applications that these people had put in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, I was contacted by Daniella, who was seven months pregnant, in Sydney. Together with her husband and two-year-old daughter, she wanted to relocate back to Adelaide, where she was born and had a family. They gave an exemption to the husband and not to his wife. How ridiculous! She was a woman who was expecting a baby. They were a couple. They gave an exemption to the husband to come back but not to the wife. They had rented a house in Adelaide. They'd packed up their belongings. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many South Australians remained stuck on the other side of the border, in Victoria, for months and months, and now we're hearing of more frustrations. People who came last week were given an exemption before the borders were open. Those people are now self-isolating for 14 days. They're not allowed to leave their home. Yet, if you crossed the border from the 23rd onwards you're free and out in the community. It just does not make sense. It's about time the state government, the Marshall Liberal government, in South Australia and Minister Wade answered some questions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had over 7,000 people waiting to get their exemptions, with no response and no communication—absolutely nothing. Danielle is another example. She rushed to the snowfields on 24 July, when her ski-instructor son was hospitalised—he'd had a severe accident—and she could not come back with her son. She could not bring him back home, and she had to wait for months. Again, there was no discussion with SA Health. There was no time frame saying, 'You will be looked at in the next week or so.' There was absolutely nothing. You can imagine the frustration of this woman, who had a severely injured son who was in hospital—he ended up in hospital here in Canberra—and had to come back home to Adelaide. There was just no response at all from SA Health. I think it was a debacle and a shambles. I understand that we need safety in place, and rightly so, but they could at least communicate with the people that are applying for exemptions. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  Because of the pandemic, the past year has been challenging for many Australians across the country. But I'm not wavering when it comes for the people of Longman or my vision to make the electorate the best place in Australia to live and work, so I want to take this opportunity in the final sitting fortnight of the parliament in 2021 to mention some of the important achievements we have delivered for the people of Longman this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that one of the greatest challenges facing South-East Queensland is managing the skyrocketing population growth while addressing the demands on our infrastructure, particularly roads. The federal government is doing its part by funding significant road upgrades in the region. For example, we're investing $530 million to widen an 11-kilometre stretch of the Bruce Highway from four to six lanes between Caboolture and Steve Irwin Way. This massive project is already underway and should be completed in late 2023. While this project is a big step towards alleviating traffic congestion along the Bruce Highway between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, we know more needs to be done. That's why we have invested $10 million towards a planning study for a western alternative highway between Beerburrum and north Brisbane. The new major transport corridor will ultimately help alleviate congestion on the Bruce Highway north of Brisbane and will accommodate future growth in the area, particularly as the massive Caboolture West development is realised. We have also invested $130 million towards the upgrade of the new Settlement Road overpass, making this busy junction safer and more efficient for road users. A further $30 million in federal government funding has been committed to Bribie Island Road to improve safety and to improve traffic flow at critical sections of the road, which is used by thousands of motorists every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also partnering with the Moreton Bay Regional Council on around 20 different local infrastructure upgrades, from new footpaths and park upgrades to pedestrian safety measures, streetscape improvements, sports field upgrades and small road projects. These grassroots projects were made possible through the federal government's Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program to stimulate the economy during the COVID pandemic and keep people in jobs. Some of these projects have already been completed and, I'm pleased to say, are already making a positive difference in our local community. Many others are underway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mobile phone coverage and network issues have long been a sore point for some communities in the Longman electorate. I've lobbied long and hard on this issue and have fought to improve mobile services and get adequate coverage for every corner of Longman on behalf of the people in my electorate. I'm pleased to see that we have been heard. Longman has received funding for seven mobile infrastructure upgrades through the Mobile Black Spot Program and is set to receive further upgrades through the federal government's new Peri-Urban Mobile Program. I will continue fighting for this and other projects that are much needed in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it has been my privilege to be a member of the government that has provided dozens of grants to local schools and community groups to help them cover the cost of vital upgrades and improvements to their facilities. Watch this space. There's more to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  In Darwin and my electorate of Palmerston in the Northern Territory, there is an incredibly diverse community of Australians, international students and workers from the Pacific who are picking our mango crops. There are people from all over the world doing all sorts of things, and I just want to acknowledge a recent event in my electorate. It was a pop-up art show at the Northern Centre for Contemporary Art for NT Legal Aid's Your Rights Through Art project. The project began as a workshop for international students living in the Territory, using art classes to engage, empower and educate them about their legal rights in Australia whilst they are studying and working. The students also learned about respectful relationships, employment, money and renting rights. As well, they developed new artistic skills such as different painting styles, drawing, watercolours and collage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to congratulate the winner of this project, Nadira Yasmin Neela, and the people's choice award winner, Eva San. Nadira, the winner, had incredible artwork which really went to her experiences in Australia. She has just finished a nursing degree and has volunteered to go down to the COVID outbreak in Katherine and the communities that are hard hit by COVID around Katherine as a nurse. Basically, as soon as she graduated she put up her hand to go down there and help. Her experience, an unfortunate one but something that we can all learn from, is that she was working for a big multinational company in the food retail business and she had a boss who said to her: 'Get that hijab off. We don't want you in this workplace with a hijab on.' She's a young woman, a Muslim from Bangladesh, and she broke down and had a very difficult time from that overt discrimination. So she really appreciated, obviously, being part of this event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International students are so important to us. Like many international students and migrants, she worked through that discrimination and she was supported by the wonderful people such as those at NT Legal Aid. I want to thank the community education team at NT Legal Aid; the NCCA, the Northern Centre for Contemporary Art, and, in particular, Petrit, who does a great job running that; and the NT government, who made this project possible. Despite the hardships they've faced, with the support of the community I just want to let international students know how welcome they are. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  In the worst of times we see the best of Australians, particularly regional Australians, and we have definitely seen that in recent days in and around Forbes. That town on the Lachlan River has of course been besieged by rising floodwaters. Hundreds of homes were under threat. Many of them had water running through them, and now there is the big task of ripping up carpet and doing all those messy and muddy things after a flood goes through—that is the job for those residents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say thanks this morning to all of those who helped willingly and voluntarily, doing what they could for their colleagues in the town and, indeed, for strangers who they may never have met before. I have to say thank you also to all the volunteers who came from all parts of New South Wales to render assistance. I spoke with a number of them. They were from the upper Hunter, they were from Kempsey, they were from all parts of our great state, there to lend a hand in the dire hour of need of the people of Forbes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want also to say thank you to the many businesses that have provided free coffee and free care packs, from the smallest coffee shop in town right up to Woolworths and Telstra. I had a meeting this morning with the regional general manager, Chris Taylor, and others in relation to the Telstra packs that were made available and taken up by 121 residents, providing free data, free calls and assistance when and where it's needed. Fifty thousand sandbags were filled by the State Emergency Service and by people just wanting to protect their own homes. There was of course an outstanding effort by the mayor, Phyllis Miller, and her shire council team. Phyllis Miller is one of the great mayors in my electorate, if not the state, and I know big things are in store for Phyllis as far as local government is concerned. But we saw the best of people and we saw the best of Phyllis during this crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the crisis is not over yet. The whole town is looking to the skies and watching the river and the floodwater levels, hoping that more rain does not tumble down and that the river does not rise any more, because the danger has not passed yet. But thank you to all of those full-time and volunteer helpers who have pitched in mightily to save what they could. I appreciate that there has been hundreds of millions of dollars of damage done to farms and crops. Forbes will get through it because it's a very resilient town—a fantastic town in the Riverina. </span>

                  </a>  It's a statement of fact. I'm not allowed to. But, if it assists the chair, I'll withdraw that. It is strange, though, isn't it—even when the entire country is saying just that. You couldn't read out in this chamber the headlines in most of the newspapers. They're calling into question the Prime Minister's pattern of a loose relationship with the truth. That is parliamentary—well established. Here, we must use nicer words. We can say 'untruth', 'falsehoods', 'a pattern of mendacity' or, as Winston Churchill famously said to get around this very problem, 'terminological inexactitude'. A bit of rhyming slang is apparently okay—the old 'Bob Cryer', 'Dunlop tyre', 'sounds like flyer'. But it is beyond question that the government is led by a man regularly observed as falsifying, misleading, avoiding, deceiving, dissembling and double-dealing—making stuff up in common parlance. I've read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>. You can't make imputations on character or motive, but you can observe on the behaviours. That's entirely parliamentary. But there are real-world consequences to the Prime Minister's pattern of behaviour, or factual inaccuracies if you want to be neutral.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister told Australians that we were at the front of the queue for vaccines. But that wasn't true. We were last in the developed world. Australians endured months of lockdowns because of this guy's spin and marketing. The Prime Minister told Australians that he'd deliver higher real wages. But that's not true. Last year, the Prime Minister presided over an economy where real wages fell by $700. In his first six years in government, including when he was the Treasurer, real wages in this country went backwards—real wages went backwards under this government, near last in the developed world. He told journalists he wasn't on holiday in Hawaii. But that's exactly where he was. It wasn't true, was it? The Prime Minister claims he's opposed to mandatory vaccinations, but that's not true either. He's imposed them on aged-care workers, Australians returning home and quarantine workers. Even journalists who attend his press conferences have to be vaccinated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister says that Labor is always higher taxing and higher spending and the Liberals are lower, except that the two highest-taxing, highest-spending governments in the last 30 years have been Liberal governments. Some of his untruths are just weird. He forgets that the television records things and that you can watch it. He said that he didn't ridicule electric vehicle technology, but he said that they'd end weekends, wouldn't tow a trailer and would stop Australians from going camping. He said that he didn't support Clive Palmer's challenge to Western Australian borders, except that he spent $1 million of taxpayer money doing just that. He said that he never said 'Shanghai Sam', but he said it 17 times on 11 occasions. How can Australians trust anything that comes out of this Prime Minister's mouth given his record of falsehoods day after day after day?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>): [by video link] I rise today to speak about vaccine mandates. We know how important vaccination is, and Australia is now one of the most vaccinated countries in the world. But I've always argued that additional coercion and pressure doesn't get you much of a result. You might move a small percentage of people who need a nudge, but you start getting distortions and deadweight loss. We're now seeing martyring of those who definitely don't want to be vaccinated. It's not terribly helpful. As a medical practitioner and a registered specialist, we will win this and vaccinate this population. We don't need to move to non-evidence-based mandates. I want to be clear about what that is. Of course there's an evidence base for vaccinating any worker in contact with COVID cases in the healthcare system, in aged care, in disability; there's very strong public health evidence for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fair Work has very clearly indicated that there are a number of tiers where the degree of reasonableness falls away as the evidence weakens. In public health, we need to make sure that that evidence is provided freely, fairly, openly, publicly and in real time. There are not enough CHOs doing that. That's a real loss for our country if, unlike the Commonwealth, the CMO and the AHPPC, we're not releasing this evidence. It must be released, if possible. Otherwise, you end up with this appalling situation I'm seeing in Queensland, where it is alleged that practitioners will squirt the vaccine on the ground for a fee of $5,000 and sign you off as having been vaccinated so that the unvaccinated can get around the mandate. That kind of behaviour is not what we need in a democracy with a high-quality health system like Australia. There are inconsistencies in border travel for people flying in from overseas. If they fly via Sydney, they get hotel quarantine in Queensland; if they fly direct to Brisbane, they get to home quarantine. These are inconsistencies not based on public health evidence. On Sunday 5 December at 9 am at the Cleveland Library, I'll be talking about these vaccine mandates, where they belong and where they have no place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to talk about homelessness in my electorate. This is a really important issue. I made a pledge three years ago that no Redlander should live without a roof over their head. In the last week we've seen a complete collapse again in homelessness services, with the Homeless United Program being defunded by the state Labor government—a perfectly-working, 98 per cent successful program replaced by the northside drive-in drive-out service of part-timers. It's not good enough, Minister Enoch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spent the past two days on a full-court press trying to help a family with six children who were left in a park in the rain, living in a tent, because there were no services. Queensland Housing rose to that challenge. They moved the earth to get this family housed. The family are now housed, and I am so proud that Queensland Housing lifted where providers were not able to. We need to remember this: some of us will find ourselves in these terrible situations where we're without a home. No child should have to go through that. I want to thank Andrew and Helen Drysdale, from Pat Barrett Realty, who stayed with that family until we got them housed. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  The cricket season is upon us and, as men and women across my electorate start to gather together and train, I would like to encourage all of our women's teams this year. I was proud to create the inaugural Lisa Chesters trophy for the local Bendigo cricket competition last year. It was the first time we had a competition that had both of the leagues coming together to play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year will be another great year for women's cricket in Bendigo, but what we need are facilities. We have more and more women taking up the sport and wanting to play, but we don't have the change rooms that are required. We want to host bigger competitions, we want to host some of the big teams coming to our area, but we don't have the facilities that we require. We're not asking for brand-new facilities; we're asking for funding to our part of the world to help upgrade the facilities that we have. Local government can't do it alone. The state government is assisting, but we really need the federal government to get involved. We really need the help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment there isn't a fund to help fix these facilities. The advice that I get back is to apply to the Building Better Regions Fund, but to date our electorate has done poorly in the allocation of funding from this fund. It has also become a catch-all excuse for government ministers to the regions. If they don't have a fund, if they're not willing to help out, they tell everybody to apply to the Building Better Regions Fund. That is simply not fair and not workable. How can a small club like Axe Creek Cricket Club compete against the City of Greater Bendigo? They simply can't, and they just continue to miss out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sports rorts was a problem for this government. While sports funding was a great idea, it was poorly executed. It is disappointing that we haven't seen another community sports fund come about since then, because the original idea was right. Let's help our regions, let's help our communities refresh, rebuild and revamp their facilities so that people have the infrastructure that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kyneton soccer club is still waiting for its new pitch. It has been very wet in Victoria, as it also has been in large parts of Australia, and at the end of their soccer season they had to play away because their ground was waterlogged. They could have got money through the fund, but we found out later that the money was taken away and given to another project. That is disappointing, because the ground still needs to be upgraded. These are projects that are too large for local government but not large enough to get on the federal government's radar—we need extra funding. We need the federal government to partner with local government and clubs to upgrade these facilities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  As members of federal parliament we all have the great privilege of meeting incredible members of our local communities, great Australians who do so much for their community. The role of government is vital, but the role of those working in the community is equally important. That's the glue that holds everyone together on a day-to-day basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many people in my electorate of Casey, and so many in each of your electorates, but today I want to focus on just one, and that is Neil Gryst. I've known Neil for 20 years—the entire time I've been the member for Casey. In September he turned 98. He is a World War II veteran. After the war, he worked in a variety of jobs. He studied at night school for four years to gain some qualifications in his speciality of marketing and public relations. He is a longstanding member of my party—in fact, he was the first local Liberal member I met when I was standing for preselection 20 years ago. Above and beyond that, he is a stalwart of the Croydon RSL, where he has served with great distinction, helping veterans in need over all those years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neil's history is a great Australian story, and today I wanted to place that on the parliamentary record. He's been a great member of the Liberal Party, a great member of the RSL and a great community contributor. As you'd expect, at 98 he's had a few physical health issues along the way, but his mind is as sharp as ever and his compassion is still there for his fellow veterans at the Croydon RSL. These are the people that do so much to make Australia what it is, doing so much over so many years without asking for reward or recognition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just felt today that Neil Gryst, who I haven't been able to see for a long period of time as a result of the restrictions we've all been facing, deserves some of that recognition—that World War II generation that did so much for us so long ago, and then, after years of service, came back to Australia to build the country that we are today and to serve in so many other ways, as he's done over decades. Neil, congratulations on everything you've done, and I wanted to mention you today in the Federation Chamber of the House of Representatives.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  Make no mistake, as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing another arguably more alarming one the shadow pandemic. As this report states, approximately one in five Australians and nearly half of all adults will experience a mental or behavioural condition in their lifetime. Over 65,000 Australians make a suicide attempt each year, and over 3,000 Australians per year, sadly, end their lives that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been aware of the need to improve mental health services. Indeed, one of my very first campaigns when I ran for the federal parliament was to establish a headspace facility in Mount Gambier. I was pleased to deliver this, and Limestone Coast youth now have access to important mental health services. Now I'm campaigning for an adult Head to Health centre for Barker because I know that we need to improve access to community-based mental health services to a broader demographic, particularly in rural and regional communities. As this report outlines, the committee has heard that, across the board, there are insufficient services to treat people, whether with preventative interventions, low-level care or, indeed, high-level interventions. Services are needed to cater to different populations, especially those who require acute care, are living in rural and remote areas or are at risk of suicide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the finalisation of this report, the South Australian coroner handed down the findings of an inquest into the death of Theo Nicholas Papageorgiou, who, at the age of 27, died as a result of compression of the neck due to hanging. While this inquest did not form part of the committee's inquiry, I want to take the opportunity to outline the circumstances of Theo's death, as they highlight quite blatantly the failing of our mental health system. The deputy coroner found that Theo's death was preventable. The inquest uncovered multiple failings in the mental health system in the Riverland, the regional community where Theo lived and worked. Despite Theo's parents doing their unquestionable best to seek the support for Theo that he needed, a lack of appropriate facilities and services and disjointed service provision failed Theo, and it failed his family. Theo was misdiagnosed. There was no communication between the clinicians in the Riverland who saw Theo, and there was a culture of passing the buck. Theo was placed on an inpatient treatment order at the Riverland General Hospital in November 2015. But the Riverland General Hospital did not—and still does not—have a closed ward capable of keeping Theo detained past the initial seven-day order. Rather than Theo being moved to an appropriate facility in Adelaide, he was sent home, despite being clearly and profoundly mentally unwell. Theo was floridly psychotic and was having delusional thoughts at this time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquest found that the psychiatrist who had recently taken over the case was overwhelmed by work and did not have the full background to Theo's case. The deputy coroner remarked:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In many ways it is astonishing that—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">the psychiatrist—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">would not have been aware of Theo's complete mental history going back to 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is difficult to see how discharge of Theo could have been contemplated as early as the second or third day given his presentation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of months later Theo's condition deteriorated and he fell into severe depression. At that point Theo's parents attempted twice to have Theo detained again through presentations at the emergency department of the Riverland General Hospital, which is a private service operated by GPs. The mental health ward in which Theo had previously received treatment is located under the same roof but operated by the state government. Both attempts by Theo's parents to have Theo detained again were denied in the emergency department, and Theo was sent home. The coroner noted that, because of the divide between the mental health ward and the emergency department, no consultation notes were passed between the services. The morning after Theo's parents' second attempt to have him detained, he was found dead. Theo's death occurred three days before he was due to see the 'visiting psychiatrist'—'visiting' being the key word. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquest heard that funding issues affecting country mental health services still exist more than five years after Theo's death. Recommendations in the coroner's report include the need for more psychiatrists in country South Australia. There are currently only three psychiatrists focused on acute cases and semi-acute cases in country South Australia, and two of them are in temporary positions. As the committee heard, to address workforce issues the federal government established an independent task force, the National Mental Health Workforce Strategy Taskforce, to work with the Commonwealth Department of Health and the National Mental Health Commission to develop a 10-year national mental health workforce strategy. The committee also heard from the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, who reinforced that there are access challenges, particularly in regard to psychiatrists. This is something Theo and his parents faced firsthand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has committed $11 million in funding so far to boost the psychiatric workforce by increasing the number of training places, including in regional and remote areas, as well as additional funding to provide scholarships and clinical placements for nurses, psychologists and allied health practitioners. As the committee comments:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over the years Australian governments have made commitments to providing equity of services to regional, rural and remote communities. Yet, Australia still has unacceptably high numbers of people unable to access the services they need in the right place at the right time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee was pleased to see the additional money in the 2021-22 budget to increase training places for psychiatrists and scholarships and clinical placements to develop other mental health professionals, noting the skewed distribution of the mental health workforce and that a focus of these placements should be on strengthening—and I stress this—the regional, rural and remote mental health workforce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the federal government takes the lead on a 10-year workforce strategy that includes more training places for psychiatrists, the state government must immediately move to decentralise and increase the provision of mental health services. As Theo's case tragically highlights, we desperately need more psychiatric services in country South Australia. Currently, there is very little support for regional staff who work in Country Health SA's 13 mental health teams, a system that is, as Theo's case identified, completely inadequate. The few psychiatrists who do work in country SA, including the visiting psychiatrist who saw Theo, are overwhelmed by work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a member of this committee and I heard the evidence that was presented. I've also represented regional communities in South Australia, including the Riverland, where Theo Papageorgiou lived and worked. He was a well-respected and much-loved member of the community. I also chair the parliament's Select Committee on Regional Australia. I know that our regions are a great place to live. </span>

                    </a>  Before we suspended for a division in the House, I indicated that I have been a part of the work of this committee and I've heard the evidence presented. I also represent regional communities in South Australia, including the Riverland, where Theo Papageorgiou lived and worked and was a well-respected and much-loved member of our local community. I chair the parliament's Select Committee on Regional Australia. I know that our regions are great places to live. I know that people who live in our regions are resilient and punch above their weight. I know that they do this while not having access to the same level of services as those who live in metropolitan areas. That's just the reality. But regional people deserve better than what this report has highlighted. Theo and his parents, Poppy and Jack, deserved better. The committee heard that Lifeline Australia estimates that, for each life lost to suicide, the impacts are felt by up to 135 people, including family members, work colleagues, friends, first responders and others. Imagine what this does in a regional community that is, by definition, far more connected.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As governments, we need to do better. The report makes it plain. This is not just at a federal level. I will be meeting with the South Australian minister for health to discuss the coroner's report that I've spoken about today and its important recommendations, including that we make resident psychiatrists available to regional South Australians. The system, sadly, is failing, and I'll be fighting at every level, within my own government and with the state government, to listen to this committee's recommendations and those of the South Australian coroner and act now to ensure that we put as much effort into the shadow pandemic and the mental health challenges as we've put into the COVID-19 pandemic and its challenges. I commend the report to the House and I thank Jack and Poppy Papageorgiou for allowing me to speak about Theo in this place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  There have been many reports into Australia's mental health system, and its failures are well known and widely discussed: high costs for many patients and terrible shortages of psychologists and psychiatrists that mean long waits, long distances to travel or people simply not seeking the help that they need. That's particularly the case for children, with big gaps in treatment for eating disorders, failures of community care and a horrific suicide rate. Our committee already knew these things, and our inquiry has been focused on what has gotten better or worse as a result of a summer of bushfires across much of the nation and then COVID—and, of course, for areas like mine, you can add in floods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've found is that COVID rushed forward what might otherwise have been tentative and overdue steps to telehealth, giving people no option if they wanted to continue their treatment and providing, for some, an easier access to new treatment. But, of course, it hasn't worked for everyone. As we say in the report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While evidence strongly supported the increased availability of telehealth, there was broad agreement that it was most effective as part of a suite of mental health services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We supported the calls by the Productivity Commission and others to make permanent the access to psychological therapy and psychiatric treatment by videoconference and telephone which was introduced during the COVID-19 crisis. We need to see that funding and that allowance made permanent. We'd also like to see ongoing funding for digital mental health research, considering the increased prevalence of mental health problems and the rapid expansion of this virtual mental health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for any step forward, there have been steps back. The need for mental health services has blown out as a result of the disasters and the pandemic that we've experienced. I asked one witness: at what point do resilient people—like those in my community, who've faced fire, flood and COVID, affecting every aspect of their life—flounder? His answer was simple. He said, 'You're resilient until you're not.' I speak with people on an almost daily basis who say that the consequences of bushfires, floods and COVID—the impacts on their business or their work, their access to family members or the effects of isolation—have broken them as never before. We know that, when it comes to natural disasters, the greatest need is not necessarily the day after the disaster. It might be weeks, months or even years. Each one of us is different, and we can't easily predict what will break someone or what will make someone else stronger. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know, though, from Black Dog Institute figures, that every year more than 65,000 Australians make a suicide attempt. Suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians between 15 and 44 years of age. Young Australians are more likely to take their own lives than to die in a motor vehicle accidents, and the suicide rate among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is approximately twice that of non-Indigenous Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key recommendation of our report is to make services accessible to everybody. That means physically accessible and financially accessible. Help needs to be affordable. We recommend looking at the viability of bulk billing incentives that are currently available to GPs being similarly made available to other mental health practitioners where patient affordability is an issue. Safe access to services needs to be increased for the LGBTIQ+ communities, for people who are culturally and linguistically diverse, for people in rural and remote areas and for First Nations people. A number of the 44 recommendations in the report request urgent action on these matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we heard much evidence about the impact of the pandemic and natural disasters on young people. Patrick McGorry, executive director of Orygen and professor of youth mental health at the University of Melbourne, points out that, even prior to the pandemic, the system was already woefully unable to meet the level of need. He estimates a 30 per cent increase on top of the normal level and describes it as a mental health emergency, where young people who are seriously ill, in life-threatening situations, cannot get the help that they need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about schools and the conclusions we drew after taking much evidence about the important role they play and could play in the future in helping young people manage their mental health, helping to prevent suicide and assisting with emotional wellbeing. We heard that, as I think we in this place would all know, school counsellors play a vital role. They bring qualifications to the job that make them a key part of tackling these complicated issues in many young people's lives. We also heard of the impossibility of the task, given how few of them there are. When you hear of a counsellor having a day or two a week at a school, it's no wonder there are kids failing to access that support and that counsellors report an impossible workload. We've recommended that the government work with state and territory governments to increase the ratio of school psychologists to a minimum of one full-time equivalent onsite for every 500 students across all levels of schools. This will support the work already happening in some states, but it needs to be a minimum. We need to make sure that the best use of government funds is made in our schools to ensure quality mental health support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't underestimate the benefits of early intervention of access to quality mental health services. It's obviously the right thing to do, but it's also the cost-effective thing to do. There are such big gaps for young people, and I see them in my own electorate in the Hawkesbury where there is no headspace to allow an easy access and early intervention for young people. Young people need to be able to walk through youth focused doors and deal with people who understand where they're coming from. As the Katoomba headspace shows: build it, and they will come. Katoomba's demand has exceeded its expectations since opening 18 months ago. It is shameful that there's no headspace in the Hawkesbury and that this government has done absolutely nothing to fix that problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big obstacles that we see in many of the issues related to improving access to mental health services is workforce. There wasn't a single witness who told us that they had all the workers that they needed to meet the demand. The government needs to act on finalising the national mental workforce strategy as a matter of urgency. We have multiple recommendations in this report to address workforce issues such as extending funding to five-year cycles so organisations like primary health networks can offer some security to their workers beyond one- or two-year contracts, which may help reduce people leaving for more secure work. Another issue we looked at is around the role of peer support, and there is more work to be done to ensure that the lessons being learnt about peer workers and the role that they can play are shared across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Suicide Prevention Australia told us that less than half of the people who die by suicide access, or may even need to access, the mental health system. They talked about life events that can lead to suicidal distress such as marriage breakdown, economic instability and/or job loss and housing distress. They are the elements, they said, that have an impact on a person's potential suicide risk. So, instead of a focus on mental health support, they want to see a model of peer support where it's not about a clinical issue but mates helping mates. We certainly see these approaches happening in the building industry in my electorate. These sorts of workforces are critical in ensuring there's a safety net for people, preventing them from getting into suicidal distress. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our committee also recognised the work of pharmacists and other allied health professionals, and the extraordinary things they do in this space. We didn't overlook carers for whom the current system doesn't work well. It doesn't support them, and we recommend a national carer strategy which includes a way for unpaid carers to be integrated into care teams and to access training for suicide awareness and prevention. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the individuals and groups who made submissions to this committee, including the Mountains Youth Services Team from my own Blue Mountains. Their evidence of the high rate of suicidal ideation that they see in clients was confronting, and the support they provide to young people in crisis situations is no doubt replicated by other similarly underfunded organisations, remembering that many of these services are designed to provide broad youth services rather than specialist mental health services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make particular mention of committee chair Dr Fiona Martin, the member for Reid, who has led this committee and ensured that no voice was left unheard. I want to thank both the deputy chair, the member for Dobell, and the member for Werriwa for your commitment to the intense winter days in quarantine and lockdown that we spent taking evidence. I also acknowledge my other committee members. It was clear that our collective determination to see action on these matters drove the work we did. I commend the report and thank the secretariat for their work in making it possible.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282983" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  I will start where the previous contributor to this debate left off and acknowledge all the work done by the committee. The committee chair, the member for Reid, in particular, has worked incredibly hard on this report, as have all members on the committee, including me. It has been incredibly beneficial having somebody with the qualifications and passion of the member for Reid stewarding this inquiry, and this has certainly been borne out in the recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must all work hard to break down the stigma that has historically surrounded mental health—I know that that's something that has bipartisan support—and, further, to break down the barriers that may be present that prevent anyone from connecting with the help and the services that they need in their time of need. We know early intervention is key throughout all significant stages of life. It provides support to parents through pregnancy, the foundations in schools and, then, support as children transition to adult life. I want to commend the chair for her work in detailing what needs to be done to address, in particular, the issues surrounding the need for specialist workforces to address and continue to adapt to changing environmental factors in our lives that contribute to our mental health. I also want to thank all of those who made submissions—the many organisations that lent their considerable weight and expertise to the committee's findings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends increased funding for specialist services such as forensic, perinatal and autism services to innovate, expand and meet demand. Dealing with these workforce issues really is the missing piece of the puzzle. As more funding is being provided by government to Medicare and to individuals to access mental health services, too many providers, especially those targeted at the young, are reporting significant issues with filling the workforce to meet demand. The fact that the committee had a significant focus on these workforce issues is to its credit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note also that it was pleasing to see the success of programs that were put into place during the pandemic, such as telehealth, which gave immediate access to help. There aren't too many silver linings to the COVID-19 pandemic, but this is surely one. In the normal course of business, I have no doubt that it would have taken years of consultation—probably a decade—to convince doctors and patients of the role that telehealth could play in health services. Instead, it was introduced in a matter of weeks, with patients and health professionals given a very practical demonstration of how successful it could be and the circumstances in which it could be useful. It's now an enduring legacy of the pandemic. It won't replace face-to-face health care, nor should it; that will remain paramount. But it clearly has an important role to play in ensuring that vulnerable communities have access to the services they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic also has elevated the importance of crisis mental health. The recommendation of the committee that the Chief Health Officer for Mental Health be present at all state and territory crisis meetings is important so that mental health considerations can be made at the time broader health orders are made. I hope to see this adopted in the future. While I don't think that considerations of those mental health impacts will change the medical advice, I hope it will ensure that mental health support that may be needed as a result of implementing some of those orders is available more quickly and to those communities that need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the report indeed identifies the need to prioritise youth mental health, I think there is far more that we can do. I personally have more ambition for this space than the report has and I want to see far more funding for our young people who are experiencing mental health challenges. Research clearly shows that, if we can get support for young people early, we can head off a raft of problems and pain later in life. We can assist them and prevent them from developing those chronic mental health concerns that would plague them as individuals and lead to such loss of happiness and economic potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report was hesitant to single out the success of individual services, but of course I have no such hesitancy. I want to pay particular tribute to headspace for the vital work that it does for young Australians who are experiencing points of mental health crisis. It's doing magnificent work. In particular, my service in Taringa in the electorate of Ryan is the second busiest in Australia. I know that I will continue to fight for more funding, and we, as a government, need to further support and fund these centres. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly know that there is extra ongoing funding on the table for these centres as a result of the recent budget. It's waiting on the support of state governments, including the Queensland government, which has shown no urgency or desire to sign up to a funding agreement with the Commonwealth. My call to them is that mental health support, particularly for young people, is beyond politics. It's something that is supported and encouraged on a bipartisan basis, and I can see no reasonable reason that the Queensland government isn't engaging in very fruitful talks with the Commonwealth government to ensure that headspace and other youth mental health services have the ongoing funding that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to record my support for the School Chaplaincy Program. It supports over 3,000 school communities Australia wide, providing pastoral care and programs—such as breakfast clubs, activities and workshops—especially in my electorate of Ryan. Before coming to this place, I spent a decade as a local councillor working with my local schools, and I have seen firsthand, time and time again, the wonderful pastoral role that chappies play and the important impact they have in a young kid's life. They are embedded in their school community. They're strongly supported by those school communities, especially by parents, and, because they're not a teacher but one of them—so to speak—the kids feel it is much easier to talk to them about issues they might be facing both at school and at home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not think there is a need to review this service, as the committee report recommends, in recommendation No. 41. I think the chappie program is effective and is greatly needed, as I have seen firsthand. But, if there is to be a review, it is my sincere expectation that its findings will show that the National School Chaplaincy Program is so effective that it should be given more funding and more support to continue the excellent work it does in our schools and to ensure it's rolled out to more schools to support the health and wellbeing of students. That's my position, and I believe it is the position of the coalition government, which has always given unwavering support to the chappie program. This committee report is the product of a lot of hard work, particularly by the chair and the committee members, and I want to thank them. I commend it to the House. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  I rise to take note of the Select Committee on Mental Health and Suicide Prevention's final report. The committee was tasked with providing recommendations, based on a number of reports that have been released over the last three years, and providing a road map for improvements to reduce suicide and the suffering that mental ill health causes our community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've all experienced in the last two years, Australia has been presented with many events both here and overseas that have challenged our normal way of life and caused stresses to many. The horrific fires of 2019 touched all Australians, with many losing their homes and livelihoods, and, just as people were getting back on their feet, many states in Australia were flooded. Since 2020, we have all endured the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID, through the necessity to keep us safe, has taken away what humans really crave the most—the support of family and friends. This was, of course, for the best of reasons, but it has increased the incredible stress on many Australians and the mental health system that supports them. Extended lockdowns have meant people have been touched by isolation. They've missed significant events with their families and friends, exacerbating the fear of the unknown, and that has affected every corner of the earth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2020 productivity report, the Royal Commission into Victoria's Mental Health System and various other investigations into Australia's mental health provisions have highlighted that the system is suffering from unaffordable access for all Australians who need support for their mental health. Issues with your mental health can affect every part of your life, including your relationships and physical health. It can affect a person's capacity to care for themselves and others and hinder a person's capability of participating in social and family events. Approximately one in five Australians and nearly half of all adults will experience some sort of mental or behavioural condition in their lifetime. It can be episodic, acute or chronic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear from the evidence the committee heard that early intervention and proper evidence based support is what can make a difference in people's lives and ensure they are able to improve their mental health as soon as possible. The committee heard that, although advances have been made with respect to many conditions, misunderstanding and stigmatisation are still a problem for many people, and this stigma leads to deferred action and can lengthen the time that someone is unwell. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final report released by this committee proposes evidence-based recommendations that will steer our approach to mental health in the right direction. It shows there is a need for a big-picture approach to mental health in Australia to account for the long-term effects of the pandemic. I see it in my community, where rates of mental ill health are skyrocketing, without appropriate services to deal with them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Pulse of South West Sydney CALD communities: amplifying voices during COVID-19</span>, which was recently released by the Western Sydney Migrant Resource Centre, found the impact on mental health was the biggest issue across diverse backgrounds. This is also a feeling among diverse communities across the country. This is why the committee recommended that the Commonwealth fund training resources for the mental health workforce to provide culturally appropriate and sensitive services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, CALD communities and gender-diverse individuals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and again during the hearings we were told about the lack of appropriate services to support those who were struggling. Teenagers are waiting months for support in a time of unprecedented stress. For two consecutive years, year 12s came in and out of online learning with an HSC around the corner. This is an exam that in the best of circumstances can cause extreme stress for its participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard in successive hearings about the severe lack of services in regional and remote areas. There needs to be decisive and comprehensive action to address issues in this sector. Professor Ian Hickie said that the mental health system should provide the right care first time. He believes that governments need to model in advance what the outcomes of our system should be, who needs to be involved in the service delivery and how best that can be achieved moving forward. Professor Hickie put to the committee that modelling has shown that, if all these things are agreed upon around Australia, we could spend approximately $14 billion a year on mental health. If we don't make these decisions and continue a business-as-usual approach, we will see Australians spending $22 billion a year on a system that is still not functioning efficiently. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the evidence the committee heard pointed to workforce shortages and overwork of those professionals in the system. At times in some communities, especially in our outer suburbs and regional and remote areas, there are long waiting lists. Improvements in mental health are best achieved with timely support and appropriate medical assessment and interventions by, in many cases, multidisciplinary teams. We need more psychologists in schools, better access to professionals, affordable services, the expansion of digital services, and funding for regional and remote services and for culturally appropriate support for CALD and First Nations citizens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommended the Commonwealth invest in research to determine the long-term impacts of trauma and how it is being compounded by successive natural disasters. Any decisions that are made require data to ensure that plans are made properly and that limited resources are being used efficiently to make a difference. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also recommended that accessibility be at the forefront of all policymaking. This recommendation, along with the investment to determine the long-term impacts of trauma, will go far in identifying mental ill health in Australia. Identifying the causes and being aware of these causes is a fundamental step in the process of mental health and suicide prevention. The inclusion by the Department of Health and the National Mental Health Workforce Strategy Taskforce of national standards of suicide prevention training for all health and allied health professionals in the National Mental Health Workforce Strategy is one recommendation which will have a positive blanket effect on mental health and suicide prevention. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommended that more work should be done in schools to combat mental ill health. This includes an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of all existing programs supporting the wellbeing of students in schools. Increasing the number of psychologists in schools will have a huge impact on the outcome of these programs. Also, training teachers in wellbeing and mental health support is essential for positive outcomes. Teachers need to be prepared to respond appropriately if a student reaches out for help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the hearings we also heard about the importance of IT coordinated care. Professor Hickie urged that receiving the right care first time is crucial. He argued for the widespread adoption of smart healthcare technologies. They could easily be developed to support a wide range of organisations. Australia is a leader in mental healthcare innovation, but we lack the fundamental IT backing that can improve support across the sector. Access to the NBN and to telehealth is a problem throughout Australia, but particularly in regional areas, and there is also a lack of face-to-face appointments with medical specialists in the community. Professor Hickie talked about the urgent need for support in regional and remote areas. He believes the system as it stands is not structured for the benefit of regional areas, and non-government organisations are doing little to help. Professor Hickie also advocated for regionalisation, which means cooperation between federally funded primary health networks, state-run services and the non-government sector, as well as strong action from private health to address the gaps in services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like now to thank everyone who took the time to make submissions and who so generously provided their expertise in hearings over the past nine months. Your insights and assistance with our questions are very much appreciated, and I hope you can see your particular information in our report. I would also like to thank the secretariat for their practical support during this inquiry. I appreciate so much their organisation of online forums when for much of the time they were also working remotely. I would like to thank my fellow committee members for their collegiate and bipartisan approach to this committee, especially the member for Macquarie; the deputy chair, the member for Dobell; and the chair, Dr Fiona Martin, the member for Reid. I'm truly grateful to all of you for assisting me to understand this area of policy formation. I commend the recommendations of the report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  It's a pleasure to follow my friend the member for Werriwa, and I note her good work on this committee—as I note your work on this committee as well, Deputy Speaker O'Brien. I also note the leadership of the member for Reid and the member for Dobell, as well as other members, including the member for Ryan, the member for Stirling, the member for Macquarie and the member for Barker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very important and serious report. Although I am not a member of this committee, I chair the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention and have a long interest in this issue, having been bereaved by suicide when I lost my father—a matter I spoke about in my maiden speech some years ago. You can see the amount of work that has been done on this report by the fact that it's 336 pages, and there are 44 highly considered recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things the government has done recently is to put together a whole series of streams of advice on mental health and suicide prevention, of which this report is the latest. Anybody who has had a chance to read the Productivity Commission report—I know the Productivity Commission report will have been thoroughly considered by this committee—will know the way in which they tried to consider the whole environment, the whole regulatory architecture and the interplay of Commonwealth, state and non-government sectors in dealing with mental health and suicide prevention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most significant thing in the Productivity Commission report was the statement about universal aftercare, and I'm very pleased that the government, in its budget earlier this year, committed to providing universal aftercare. I believe that is the game changer in making a serious dent in the suicide numbers in this country. I think there is one thing the Productivity Commission did not get right. They actually understated the number of people whose lives would be saved as a result of universal aftercare. After you have a hip replacement or a knee replacement you go into rehabilitation; they don't just send you home. But in too many of Australia's states, unfortunately, after a person has been admitted to a mental health unit the practice has been to discharge them into the night, into the street. That's not appropriate. Universal aftercare provides step-down rehabilitation, constant contact for people who have suffered a mental health illness or, indeed, have attempted to take their own life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why this particular measure can make such a difference is that, unlike other measures in the suicide prevention area, we know the people who are most at risk of dying by suicide are people who have made a previous attempt. So, if you've made a previous attempt and we know who you are and we know where you live, we can put into place things to take care of you. We won't save every life, but with proper universal aftercare we will certainly save more lives than we are saving now, so I want to commend the government for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing I want to note—and, in doing so, I want to draw attention to a particular part of this excellent report—is that the government has announced a $114 million grants program for organisations to engage in community suicide prevention activities, which I think is very important. I think the missing piece in what we have rolled out in terms of suicide prevention is universal suicide first aid that can be rolled out in workplaces. I will illustrate why I think workplaces are important in a moment. One of the most important things that we can do is to look out for others and to notice the signs and know what to do if we see the signs that somebody might be contemplating suicide. I note that the inquiry report talks about promoting wellbeing in the workplace and says:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is now greater recognition 'peer based early intervention case management models can dispense with the need for professional gatekeepers' and thereby help ease the burden on the health system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through its own experience, MATES in Construction stated the issues seen in workplaces 'are not going to be a surprise to anyone—relationship issues for 38 per cent of those presenting, work related issues are about a quarter, family issues are about a quarter, and financial stress is about one in seven cases'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recognising the 'fluid factors' in suicide prevention and the fact a significant number of people may not see a psychologist or other mental health professional, the Australian Association of Psychologists Inc (AAPi) spoke in support of a community focus on suicide prevention, including education in the workforce and in areas where rates of suicide may be higher.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia agreed that mental health issues in society require a holistic approach, acknowledging the role employers have to play in addressing mental health as a community issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the work of MATES in Construction and MATES in Mining and other organisations that are workplace based in terms of providing that suicide first aid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to explain why I think workplace-based suicide first aid delivered nationally is going to be such an important thing. In 2018 I challenged my community in Berowra to become a suicide-safe community. What did I do? I gathered 170 community leaders, from 170 different organisations in my community, together for a night at the local RSL club, and I had one of Lifeline's suicide prevention trainers come and talk to the community organisations and put them through what was then called a Lifeline accidental counsellor course. I then challenged those community organisations to go and roll out a similar course within their organisation, whether it was a church, a P&amp;C, a Rotary club, a local community progress group or a scouting body. We also had the council and the hospitals, public and private, there with us. I'm pleased to say that around 20 organisations took up that offer and put on events like that. I'm also pleased to say that a new organisation, Mentoring Men, founded by Ian Westmoreland, was born as a result of that night and that other organisations, like the Hornsby Ku-Ring-Gai Community College, staged a suicide prevention day as a result of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But where I saw real uptake of the suicide first-aid courses was in the large employer organisations—the hospitals and the council. It made me realise that, while my original objective had been 'Let's get it done at the community level; let's get people in community groups to stage this,' actually there is a real benefit to staging suicide prevention training in the workplace in a way that is appropriate to the particular workers, the particular employees, and the particular management of that workplace. That's something, I think, that MATES in Construction and MATES in Mining do so well. There are other organisations, like Lifeline, like Wesley LifeForce, that provide similar sorts of courses. I know that staff in this place do the mental health first-aid version of a course from an organisation called Mental Health First Aid as part of the services that are offered by Ministerial and Parliamentary Services. I commend the parliament for providing those services. This shouldn't be something that's just available to people who work in this place. This should be something that is available to everyone. In my view, we can put in place structures to improve the operation of the medical side of the system and the psychological side of the system. We can do things like the increase the government has approved in the number of Medicare funded psychological counselling sessions that you can have in any one year. But the thing that will make more of a difference on the ground than anything is having more people looking at their neighbours, their friends and their family to see whether their conduct has changed and, if so, asking the difficult question: are you contemplating suicide? Having asked the question, they need to know what to do if the answer is yes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support an idea that's not covered in this report and I want to use this occasion to raise it publicly. I think organisations like those I've mentioned and others need to take advantage of the $114 million suicide prevention grants that are available to work together to roll out a national workplace based suicide prevention training program, so all of us can better look out for our neighbours, our friends and our colleagues. I think this would have a really significant impact on the suicide rate in this country, which, sadly, remains far too high. I want to again commend colleagues on both sides of the House for the way in which they worked to produce this very significant contribution to the public discussion and to public policy in relation to mental health and suicide prevention in this country. In my view, there is no more important social policy issue than to save the lives of our fellow citizens. There are far too many people dying by suicide in this country every single day, and I believe that these recommendations deserve serious consideration by government and other public policymakers in terms of what we can do to improve Australians' mental health and reduce the suicide rate in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  It is perfectly clear to me that the only way to achieve satisfactory action on climate change is to change the government. Moving away from the dependency upon fossil fuels requires an actual renewable energy transition. Only an Albanese Labor government will provide that certainty. People in my electorate tell me the climate crisis is the biggest challenge facing the planet, but I firmly hold it is also the biggest economic opportunity in front of Australia and, in particular, for our regions. We should be the renewable superpower. In my electorate of Gilmore we have amazing community groups leading the way on renewable energy, groups like Repower Shoalhaven, a not-for-profit volunteer run renewables organisation that not so long ago raised $500,000 in community finance in just two days. Repower Shoalhaven is an incredible community group made up of volunteers that are so passionate about seeing more renewables right across our region. It just goes to show what can happen when local community is leading the way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of Shoalhaven's first solar farm is on 10 hectares of low-value land near Nowra Hill that has been transformed into a productive ambitious asset with 8,000 enormous solar panels generating 6,000 megawatts of clean energy per year to power the equivalent of about 2,000 homes. However, this is only half of the story. The leadership of Repower Shoalhaven is in partnership with energy retailer Flow Power—you see, 20 per cent of this clean renewable energy is already allocated, and to whom? The City of Sydney council. Again, from a former low-value unused space south of Nowra, renewable energy is being generated, enabling the City of Sydney council to achieve their zero emissions target nine years early. Could there be a better win-win-win than community involvement through Repower Shoalhaven, local government involvement, local businesses to benefit by purchasing the power, job creation and local investor benefits with returns tracking at five per cent per annum?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, announced only yesterday, the University of Wollongong Shoalhaven campus will use 100 per cent renewable energy generated from the Shoalhaven community solar farm. Chair of the University of Wollongong Sustainable Futures Committee, Professor Tim McCarthy, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Keeping our energy dollars in the region gives us satisfaction and having it at the doorstep of our Shoalhaven campus is perfect alignment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this is not the definition of a circular economy, I can't tell you what is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is SHASA, the Southcoast Health and Sustainability Alliance, with a president speaking publicly that a key aspiration of SHASA is to have a community solar farm in the Eurobodalla as well. The Gilmore electorate wants to see more solar farms. We want to see more electric vehicles. Where are the EV charging stations along the South Coast? There is no charging station between Canberra and Batemans Bay. We want to see more renewables jobs on the South Coast. This fulfilled dream by Repower Shoalhaven of a solar farm shows that it is truly possible; it just needs a federal government that will support it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is moving rapidly towards renewable energy. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Australia to jump ahead of the pack. The Morrison government can't be trusted on renewables. In the past eight years, this government has announced more than 20 energy policies and delivered nothing. The Prime Minister's untrustworthiness is undermining Australia's international reputation and interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor would turn good climate policy into good jobs policy and create work, long-term secure work, in the process, additional to helping reduce power prices and emissions. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to seize this change. In the interest of our regions, we need a government that has the ambition to seize these opportunities. And that is an Albanese Labor government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  Once again, we've seen the Queensland health minister, Queensland's Darth Vader, make an attempt from the dark side to send out into orbit the space junk that the state government has created with vaccination mandates and testing confusion to enter the great state of Queensland. During this pandemic, we've seen the Queensland government, time and again, do what they do so well: deflect from their own failures and their responsibility to provide Queenslanders and those who seek to enter Queensland with a clear pathway when it comes to testing and travel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tourism and small business sectors, who have suffered blow after blow, have now suffered further due to the confusion caused by the Queensland health minister and the Premier around resident and holiday access restrictions to Australia's favourite playground, the Gold Coast. The Queensland government created this confusion around testing requirements to enter Queensland so that the Premier could position herself to ride in on a white pony—nothing against white ponies—and be seen to rescue Queenslanders from the peril of paying for testing every time they cross into the Tweed to go to work or enter Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reject that this confusion was caused by the federal government. The truth is that the Queensland Premier signed an agreement with the Commonwealth on 13 March 2020 to meet the Commonwealth 50-50 to split the difference for PCR testing with the states and the territories. Has she forgotten? Did she forget that national cabinet meeting? The arrangement has not changed. It remains in place; there's no new agreement on testing regimes with the states and the territories. What changed? What changed was the Premier decided—or perhaps she didn't decide—that travellers, returning Queenslanders and border workers maybe had to provide a certificate for their testing status. To produce a certificate, a pathology request form is required from an issuing GP. The cost of the results were reportedly $145 per person per test. How much is that for a family of six?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the tourism sector went into unnecessary meltdown on the Gold Coast. They went into further angst and damage control for our key economic pillar on the Gold Coast. Then, the Premier once again moved the goalposts. She said during a press conference, 'Yeah. An SMS would be fine. Yeah, that'd be fine.' Just like that. Just like that, the rules all changed. This is the power the premiers have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tests are free. They're free due to the agreement that I just outlined. They've been free for 18 months. As anyone who has been tested knows, these come from testing centres, not via a GP's request form. For clarity, the Commonwealth and the states together pay fifty-fifty for testing of people with COVID symptoms who attend mass testing clinics without seeing their doctor, people who require a test as a result of a state or territory public health order, including for domestic travel as a result of a state border restriction, and close contacts without symptoms, and for testing where there are workplace testing requirements in high-risk settings. It's very clear. The rules were already very clear and in place. The Commonwealth, through Medicare, funds tests for people who have COVID symptoms or are suspected of having COVID. These tests are ordered by a doctor, and the patient will have a pathology request form from the doctor for this service, and there is a cost associated with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My point is that it's absurd that the Queensland health minister and the Premier stood up and said that the Commonwealth should pay, through Medicare, for all the costs of testing due to state imposed border restrictions on travel when there is already an 18-month-old agreement in place, which they would have been well aware of. You can see where I'm going with this, Mr Deputy Speaker. It's all about the politics. A pathology test will be charged to a patient only when they are required to obtain an official certificate, rather than using the text message system that is in operation in every state and every territory. It's the Commonwealth that has spent over $1.87 billion on pathology testing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. It's the Australian taxpayer—the Queensland taxpayer—who has funded testing, and it's the Australian taxpayer who, rightly, should not have to pay to enter the great state of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I wish to be crystal clear when I say that the federal government does not mandate COVID-19 vaccinations except in the case of those working in aged care and with vulnerable people. Vaccination is free and encouraged, and it should be businesses on the Gold Coast, the entrepreneurs of the Gold Coast, who decide who comes into their business, not the state government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  I want to speak today about higher education. I noticed that the Prime Minister made an announcement yesterday about higher education and research funding for a number of universities yet to be selected. Of course, Labor is supportive of any extra funding for higher education. Universities have had a very tough couple of years with COVID-19, losing billions of dollars of revenue because of international students not being able to come to Australia. Universities need more support. As I have said many times before, they are one of our country's most vital sets of institutions. Universities drive innovation, they underpin new industries and products, and they help educate a new generation of skilled workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is really a bit much to listen to the Prime Minister talk about this sort of university funding after two years of ignoring universities, with the traumatic impact that has had, ripping the heart out of our universities. The government has spent years ignoring the impact of the pandemic on Australian universities. The Prime Minister deliberately excluded universities from JobKeeper wage subsidies. Those opposite changed the rules three times to make sure that universities would be excluded. The consequence of that has been thousands of jobs lost right around the country—in our cities, our suburbs and our regional communities as well. Thousands of university workers—40,000, in fact—have lost their jobs. It has been an astonishing attack on one of our most important export sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New technologies don't come out of thin air. Breakthroughs don't come out of thin air. We need researchers to invent or discover them, and thousands of researchers have been amongst those who have lost their jobs. An estimated 7,000 researchers have lost their jobs in just the last two years. The Prime Minister announced something yesterday about industry-university research collaboration. Who does he think will be doing this work? It is so disappointing. These researchers were from science, technology, engineering, mathematics, IT, the humanities, medicine, law. We've seen campuses closed, including in Central Queensland. Those opposite claim to stand up for regional communities. What about Biloela, the Sunshine Coast and Yeppoon? All of them have lost university campuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had important research programs close their doors. Recently, the National Centre for Flood Research in Lismore—which I've visited twice—has closed its doors. World-leading research was being done on the campus of Southern Cross University in Lismore. Right now, much of New South Wales is actually under water. We're talking about the weather for the coming years and how the El Nino effect will mean a higher risk of floods, and we're closing the doors of this unique research centre. This is one example. I could give you dozens like this. The government has spent eight years savaging our researchers, and the Prime Minister thinks he can make up for that with scraps at the last minute. The problems go so deep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, a survey of medical researchers found that 83 per cent of them had considered leaving the profession. The Australian Postdoctoral Reference Survey found that over half of our early career researchers have thought about moving overseas. We need to turn this around. If we want to be a prosperous and successful nation, we can't have our best and brightest fleeing overseas because they can't get a job in Australia. According to research by Harvard University, Australia has the economic complexity of a developing nation. We are squashed between Uganda and Burkina Faso as the 87th most complex economy in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We won't turn this around without strong universities. We won't rebuild our universities with a Liberal government. It is only ever Labor that invests in our universities. Instead of trashing our universities and turning his back on our researches and then thinking at the last minute that he can announce some funding and turn the whole show around, the Prime Minister should be held to account for the devastation that he has inflicted on our tertiary education sector.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>): I rise today to recognise our local Aussie manufacturers. Whilst out in my electorate of Bonner this month, I visited some of these homegrown manufacturers to see for myself the incredible quality of products being made in our backyards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government recognises the job-creating power of Australian manufacturers. That's why we've invested $1.5 billion to establish our modern manufacturing strategy. We support Australian manufacturers to scale up and create the jobs we need now and for generations to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bonner is home to Murarrie based defence business Cyborg Dynamics Engineering. The Morrison government has awarded them a $3.3 million contract to pursue an Australian first. It was a privilege to have a tour of Cyborg's HQ by CEO Stephen Bornstein. Stephen has been named one of Australia's 30 most innovative engineers and, in 2017, was recognised as the Australian Young Engineer of the Year. He has now grown an exceptionally motivated team focusing on robotics and artificial intelligence. His first contract was the company's first with the defence industry innovation hub, enabling them to develop an unmanned combat vehicle, the likes of which has never been made in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland is once again proving how it is at the forefront of strengthening Australia's defence capabilities. What's more, the groundbreaking work is happening in Bonner. Cyborg Dynamics are developing first-of-its-kind innovations and integrating an array of supporting Australian technologies into a robotic platform. This has the potential to enhance load carriage fire support capabilities and the protection of dismounted soldiers. It's a major win for Bonner and one that has secured 20 local jobs. Investing in our defence industry is a key priority of the Morrison government to keep Australians safe and support businesses and jobs right across the supply chain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also dropped into Murarrie's Midmed Medical Suppliers and caught up with managing director Rob Muller and general manager Paul Gapes. Midmed is yet another true-blue Aussie family owned business. They are also a national leader in supplying medical equipment. As you'd imagine, business is rapidly growing, and they're keen to shore up even more of their manufacturing capabilities during this time. This is exactly what we want to hear our local manufacturers striving for. It was great to talk about how we could make this possible and enable more local jobs and opportunities for our skilled workers. To see an Australian-grown business go from strength to strength this time is remarkable. Our government will continue to enable opportunities for them to showcase their innovations and for our green-and-gold logo to have a stronger presence on home soil and internationally.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  Australia has a proud history of manufacturing but, under this close-to-a-decade-long Liberal government, we've seen a waning in support for manufacturing. In my home state of South Australia, Holden in Elizabeth and a range of other manufacturers have struggled without the support they need from government. Australian-made products go beyond just providing jobs for Australians; they provide a high-quality product. This quote is from one of those key manufacturing businesses in my electorate: 'Australian made goes beyond simply where the product was made. It's the fact that it's been made for you, for your lifestyle, for your passion; it's made to survive the unique landscapes and extreme conditions.' That's so true. When products are made in communities, they meet communities' needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we've learnt anything from this pandemic—and I hope we've learnt a number of things—I think it has been that we have lost the ability to make many products here in Australia. This is very concerning. As we emerge from this pandemic, we need to make sure that we're supporting manufacturing and that we're ensuring that manufacturing has a good future in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we do already, despite the Liberals' inaction, have companies that have worked hard and survived. I've got some wonderful manufacturing businesses in my electorate: Adelaide Profile Services, which cuts metal and steel in my electorate; Rowlands MetalWork, which does steel fabrication; Team Poly, which manufactures tanks—it's been so wonderful to see them expand; and REDARC, who make custom-made batteries. These are just some of the great manufacturing businesses in my electorate. However, they need their government to back them, and if we're going to see an expanding manufacturing sector we need government backing them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that Labor have already announced that, if we're elected, we will have a focus on 'made in Australia'. We will support and encourage businesses to be part of the government procurement process. We buy a lot of stuff as government. We build a lot of stuff as government. I hear from many very good small manufacturers that they don't know how to be part of that process. That's why I'm so pleased that Labor have said we will establish a Future Made in Australia office to support local industry in taking advantage of government purchasing opportunities. I'm also pleased that this will be backed up by laws that will lock in key elements of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules to actively support local industry to take advantage of government purchasing opportunities. We'll also support small and medium-sized businesses by decoding and simplifying government procurement processes. This is going to be very critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, we need the skills to take up these jobs as we expand our manufacturing business, and it has been incredibly disappointing that under the Morrison-Joyce government there are 10,000 fewer places for apprentices and trainees in South Australia. This means fewer skilled job opportunities available for locals and less qualified employees. I am really pleased that Labor has already put out a number of important policies, including the Australian skills guarantee, which will ensure that one in 10 jobs on major federally funded infrastructure projects are given to apprentices, trainees or cadets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to use the power of government—our procurement power, our building power—to actually support Australians. Whether that's Australian businesses, whether that's Australian jobs, we can do a lot better, and I'm really proud that, with the election of an Albanese Labor government, we will take steps to deliver this. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  Today the Prime Minister introduced the Religious Discrimination Bill. In doing so, he talked about all the good reasons why we as a nation must say no to discrimination in all its forms. He noted that this bill will add to existing Commonwealth legislation that criminalises discrimination on the basis of age, race, gender, disability and human rights. It's rather ironic, then, that, while this bill is being debated today, unvaccinated people in Victoria are on the receiving end of some of our country's harshest discrimination restrictions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me paint a picture of this repugnant discrimination. Yesterday my friend, who I'll call Kate—not her real name—rang to let me know that, from today, she can no longer go to her local agricultural hardware store to purchase feed for her livestock. While pet stores are considered essential, stores that sell livestock feed are not. But it turns out that the store also sells petrol. As petrol is deemed an essential retail item, my friend was confused about why she couldn't simply pick up some feed at the same time as paying for the petrol. Having lived in this tight-knit community for than 10 years, she knows the staff well. In fact, they were a lifeline during the recent electricity blackouts after the storms, when they helped source a generator for her. She even promotes the business to clients because of their friendly and competent approach. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Kate entered the store, she saw all the new signs reminding people of the need to check in with their vaccination status. A bit bemused about what these signs might mean for her as an unvaccinated person, Kate half-jokingly asked the manager, 'Can't I come shopping here anymore if I'm not double vaxxed?' To her utter shock, he replied, 'No, you can't, effective tomorrow morning.' Kate then asked, 'So, if I come in tomorrow and fill my car up with diesel, can I come in and pay for it?' He said, 'Oh, that's different. You could buy petrol; that's essential. I can't ask you about your medical status when you buy petrol.' This is exactly the same checkout at which Kate pays for the other items. A bit perplexed, Kate checked a bit further. 'So you're saying that livestock feed is not essential?' The manager said, 'Kate, the advice has come from the top. I'm just following orders. You have to disclose your medical status.' Kate, who is of German heritage, took a deep breath and replied, 'Sorry, but I come from a country where they once "just followed orders". Don't worry; I won't make your life a misery, but I won't return until this madness stops.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can these restrictions be based on so-called science or health advice? You only need to look at the different approaches across Australia to know they can't possibly be—or at least that, clearly, there's a broad range of health advice that can be chosen by governments to suit their own political needs. For instance, how is it that New South Wales is reducing restrictions for unvaccinated people at the same time that Victoria is doubling up on them? We are a fractured nation of people who are hurting, and I don't understand why more of us in this House aren't standing up to call out this divisive and repugnant discrimination. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this woman to be strong and resilient, and she says she's okay, but the point is that she shouldn't have to be okay. What about the hundreds of thousands of people that are not okay—the ones that for many and varied reasons have made the choice that they would prefer to lose their job, risk their home and their ability to care for and feed their family, rather than be coerced into accepting a new vaccine about which they are unsure? The government has spent a lot of money on so-called educating people about what they're on about. But it comes down to looking like coercive control, to me, when the Victorian government is isolating you from your personal support systems, preventing you from meeting up and spending time with other family members and friends, monitoring your activity through the day by exactly what I did before I came in here, denying your freedom and autonomy, malicious name-calling, belittling you, putting you down, limiting your access to money or jobs and controlling aspects of your health and body.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend is one of the strongest, most resilient people I have ever met in my life, but it breaks my heart to know that she is enduring this. If you're unvaccinated in Victoria, you will be persecuted; you will be ostracised. Why do you think there are 50,000 people marching in the streets in Victoria? There is a bright side—there's always a bright side: the connections they're making with like-minded people are connections that will last the rest of their lives.</span>
