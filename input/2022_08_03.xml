                    </a>  We are concerned on this side that there may be some in the parliament who regard this as a very important matter and want to have the chance to vote on this. There may be people who want to call for a division. That's a matter for them, because this will be a free vote, a conscience vote. So I'd suggest to you, Mr Speaker—but I think it would be in accordance with the traditions of this parliament, particularly considering the nature of this piece of legislation—that we recommit this so that there is a clear opportunity to put the second reading so that it's clear to all what is in fact before the chamber. </span>

                    </a>  Thanks very much. Just to the point of order and to suggest a way forward: the standing order that's just been referred to, to recommit, is based on misadventure. I think it's really hard to argue that a misadventure just occurred, in that a lot of notification was given, as soon as we knew that debate had finished in the Federation Chamber, that this would happening this morning, including to the Manager of Opposition Business. That said, people will get their chance, if they want to participate in a conscience vote, to divide. If they want to do that at the third reading, the opportunity is about to be there. But I really don't think we can get into the habit of claiming recommittal on the basis that people just weren't paying attention. There are different views across the parliament on this particular bill, but I really think it'd be a big step for us to use the recommittal principle where indeed there was no misadventure. But the third reading will provide the opportunity the Manager of Opposition Business referred to. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will make amendments to reduce the regulatory burden and the cost for taxpayers and improve compliance with tax laws. The bill also delivers on the government's election commitment to provide greater flexibility for downsizers aged 55 years and over to make contributions into their superannuation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to the bill makes it easier for small businesses to comply with their record-keeping obligations.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to the bill extends existing third-party reporting requirements to operators of electronic platforms in the sharing economy. Platform operators will be required to report to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) information regarding certain transactions that occur on their platforms, such as seller identification and payment details. This information will assist the ATO in its administration of the tax system and ensure sellers on these platforms are meeting their tax obligations.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These orders will be subject to integrity checks intended to prevent aggressive taxpayers, without genuine disputes, from receiving stay orders sought with the intention of frustrating the recovery of genuine tax debts.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will allow more Australians to make a one-off post-tax contribution of up to $300,000 per person when they sell their family home.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This modest change in the eligibility age for the downsizer program complements the government's comprehensive plan on housing to improve access and affordability. This measure will increase the availability of suitable housing for growing Australian families by encouraging more older Australians to downsize to homes that better meet their needs. </span>

These changes support the regulations being able to prescribe charges that more accurately reflect the particular matter to which the charge relates. </span>

We have an unusually large number of people of all different opinions, on these bills, who would regard these bills and the issues within them as critical to how they sought election to be in this place. People have asked for a higher level of flexibility to make sure that people get to speak on the second reading.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this is carried, then the changes go as follows. The first thing is that the bills I referred to become the only bills that we debate for the rest of the day, once we hit the end of the MPI. That's when this is activated. The second thing is that speaking times, from the end of the MPI, get knocked back to 10 minutes. After 9 pm we'll have a look at the speaking list. If it looks like we're still going to finish within a reasonable period—and at the moment it doesn't—we'll let it run at 10-minute speeches. If not, a minister can inform the House that the speaking times are going down to five minutes, to try to maximise the number of people who speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, instead of 10 pm being a hard cut-off, the minister would be allowed to effectively make a decision as to whether it is becoming an absurdly late night or whether we're actually close to the end and just letting a few more people speak to go a little bit beyond 10 o'clock is a reasonable call. So both the judgement on the reduction in speaking times and the judgement on finishing times would be made by the minister at the table, which I suspect will be either the Minister for Climate Change or me. But the decisions would be made on that basis. Once again I give the undertaking to the House that I gave yesterday. The capacity for this sort of thing to be changed by a motion moved by a minister has always been there in debate management motions, and this has only ever been done in a cooperative manner, and there is no intention to do anything other than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow morning, when this bill is brought on, we would immediately have the second reading vote, and we would then go through the amendments. For each amendment, rather than it being only the mover, there would be a minimum time of 10 minutes for each amendment. This effectively allows each amendment to be put, with the mover and one or two others able to speak. We'd be able to do that in a sensible fashion. It means that these bills will have been dealt with in the House, through all stages, well before we hit question time tomorrow. That's what it means.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In anticipation of being told that this is a terrible exercise of democracy and involves the total disruption of debate, I just want to give you the example of what happened last night, because it speaks to what we're looking at now. Last night, every time I turned up the volume—and I'll accept I had moments of the evening on mute—I would hear people open their speech by explaining that they had been silenced. They would then continue to go on for 10 minutes about how they had been silenced. I remember what it was like to be silenced. The microphone gets turned off on you and no-one else gets to speak. But last night we had speaker after speaker tell us how bad it was that they weren't allowed to be heard. We had one member last night, the member for Flynn, open his speech by saying how outrageous it was that it was now only 10 minutes and he wasn't allowed to speak for 15. The member for Flynn finished after eight minutes. Then, after all the conversation that we had yesterday from those opposite saying that the 10 pm finish time was exactly the same as the gag, that it made no difference at all, they ran out of speakers at quarter to 10. Everybody who wanted to speak was able to. Every single person who wanted to put their views on the record was able to. With the procedures we've got on these bills, there is actually a greater opportunity to speak than there was last night, because we've got the option of reducing the speaking time further if required. We're effectively going down to 10 minutes immediately after the MPI; whereas last night we did it shortly before 6 pm. Sensible decisions can be made in terms of the 10 pm cut-off if there are only a few speakers left beyond that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare that to a minister just coming in without notice and moving that the question be put and everybody on the speaking list suddenly getting to say nothing, where we then spend—as we used to—sometimes an hour and a half voting on whether or not people would get to talk, and you would lose an hour and a half that could in fact have been used as parliamentary debating. I have no doubt that there will be many speeches that will happen tonight where I won't like what they say—good! That's what this room is meant to allow. That's what this room has not allowed for nine years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the different members, both across the aisle and on the crossbench, who have engaged with this. I won't pretend that when you are trying to get bills dealt with that you end up with a perfect situation, but I will say that what is in front of us now is better as a result of that consultation, and so I thank those who have been involved with it. I will also say what is happening now is a world away from what this parliament has been like for nearly a decade. I commend the motion to the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will listen with bemusement to the speeches that follow as I get told that somehow allowing people to spend their time explaining why no-one is allowed to be heard is identical to a situation where no-one got to say a word. We've been there. We've got the majority in the House now to behave exactly the same way. We choose not to for a really simply reason: we believe in the parliament and we're not afraid of hearing opposing voices. We think that's a healthy thing to do and I only wish it had been this way for a longer period of time.</span>

                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">M</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">r FLETCHER</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  The opposition does oppose this motion that has been put by the Leader of the House to manage this debate. That's the code for reducing speaking time and materially and particularly reducing the operation of the consideration in detail process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I say to the House—as I issued a warning last week—when the Leader of the House is using his reasonable voice it's important to scrutinise very carefully what, in fact, he is putting to the House, because substantively this is yet another use of the gag procedures that the government has adopted. Notwithstanding the rhetoric from the Leader of the House in his previous role and the rhetoric from the Prime Minister in his previous role of the past few years, what we're now seeing is the use of procedures where the executive government determines a much compressed speaking time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the Leader of the House about the generous way in which he has provided for everybody who might possibly want to speak to speak. Of course, what he didn't highlight so much in what he had to say was that the normal speaking times of 15 minutes will be compressed to 10 and then they can be further compressed to five, and that means that people don't have the chance to make out the arguments in the detail that they would ordinarily want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly I would highlight the, frankly, quite disgraceful crunching down of the procedures that would normally apply for consideration in detail. Consideration in detail, of course, is the process that is normally used in this House for amendments to be moved. They can be moved by any member. Also during that process questions of detail can be put to a minister—during the consideration in detail phase. The standing orders provide that any member can speak for five minutes to raise a question, make a point. The standing orders also provide that there is no limit on that. That's intended to allow an examination of amendments that are proposed, either by government or by opposition or by crossbenchers, and a full and detailed back and forth. The Leader of the House told us that, very generously, what he was now proposing is to allow a grand total of 10 minutes for each amendment. That is a very, very substantial compression of what normally would be available under these standing orders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the crossbench in particular that the changes that were put to you—the new processes in relation to bills declared urgent—were put to you before most members of the current crossbench have had the opportunity to participate in a parliamentary debate involving the consideration-in-detail process. That means that you are essentially being asked to agree to changes at a time when you might not have had the opportunity to experience exactly how that process works when the parliament is doing its work as it should. I also make the point to the crossbench that what's before the House now is not a use of standing order 85—I accept and agree with that—but it is a motion that replicates a great many of the provisions of standing order 85, with some changes, as the Leader of the House has informed us. But that means there is an opportunity for all of us in this House to consider again, on its merits, the mechanism that is being proposed and consider whether it is in fact appropriate, in view of the fact that there are, as is evident, a large number of people wanting to speak on this, wanting to express views and, very possibly, wanting to move amendments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the House has presented this in terms of the government being extraordinarily reasonable and making every possible effort for people to have the opportunity to speak. The constraint here is an artificial one. The constraint is that this government has come up with a sitting timetable involving 40 sitting days. That is a record low number of sitting days, even for an election year, if you go back and look at the record of recent years. So this is a constraint that the government has imposed on itself, because it has minimised the number of days of sitting for this parliament, and, as a consequence, we are now seeing members constrained in the time that they have to participate in debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't look just to my words to assess the veracity of what I am saying. Let me give you some other observations that have been made on this topic over the years: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… this is a chamber made up of people's representatives and it is constituted for the purposes of discussion, scrutiny and debate of legislation and other important matters …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some words that might well be appropriate to be used tomorrow morning: 'I do not think anyone can pretend that a bill that was introduced yesterday and is now going to be rammed through is going to have any of the scrutiny that this parliament is here to provide.' Here is another quote: 'The parliament should be given the opportunity to ensure that these bills actually give effect to their intended purpose,' or, 'On the issue of general scrutiny and general governance, it is the interest and responsibility of every single member of this place.' That is a statement with which I hope everybody in this House would agree. Every one of those observations came from the Leader of the House when he was in another role in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the House: the role of the parliament is important. The role of the parliament in scrutinising legislation, in holding the government to account, and in putting forward amendments—if it's the judgement that amendments are required—is important. I also say to the House that what's been proposed by the Leader of the House is neither necessary nor desirable. What should happen is that the parliament should consider this bill using its normal procedures: giving all who want to speak the opportunity to do so for the normal speaking time of 15 minutes; and giving all who want it the opportunity to move amendments and to have them considered in the consideration-in-detail process that normally applies in this parliament. The fact that that is not being done is very unfortunate. It is, in substantive terms, the second use within the first two sitting weeks of this parliament of this new gag mechanism where the government has used its numbers to give itself the power to do this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the House that that is unfortunate, it is to be regretted and it is not consistent with the high-minded rhetoric we've heard from the Prime Minister and from the Leader of the House in relation to how they will be bringing in a new kind of gentler politics. In fact, what we're seeing is, in substantive terms, a gag being applied that is very much to be regretted. It is not necessary. There is more than adequate time to debate this bill using the normal processes. Those are the reasons why the opposition will not be supporting this motion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  I have three quick responses to issues that were just raised by the Manager of Opposition Business. First of all, he had a quote from me referring to a bill that had only been introduced the day before. Well, I don't know how that's relevant to this debate. I don't get the connection there to this debate. I'm sure there are other quotes to pick, but my suggestion is he could try to pick ones that are vaguely relevant to what's in front of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, an example was given about the difference in consideration in detail. What used to happen wasn't that you got 10 minutes to speak on an amendment and wasn't that you got five minutes to speak on an amendment. It used to be that, when he was sitting on this side, you didn't even get to move the amendment. It wasn't even put to the House. So if we have come up with a mechanism which allows there to be a mover moving amendments, many of which we will not agree with, so there can be discussion in the House before the vote, and the House gets to make a decision, we make no apology for that. We make no apology for using a democratically elected House for democratic purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in the examples the Manager of Opposition just gave, he gave the game away at the end when he said, 'We should just keep the normal processes: 15-minute speeches.' Do you know what that means? It means we don't make a decision this month. It means we don't make a decision next month. It means what those opposite are asking for actually has nothing to do with procedure. They spent nine years wanting to make sure that we don't make a decision on action on climate change. Right now, the only reason they are opposing the debate management motion that's in front of us is because it says we're going to make a decision on action on climate change this week. That's what this motion decides. To those opposite: go for it! If they want to vote against making a decision this week, they should just know that I don't know what message they thought they were given during the election campaign, but it's odd to listen to the Australian people and say, 'Oh, what they're wanting is for us to continue to delay acting on climate change.' It's a very strange message to be hearing, particularly when you consider the seat that the Manager of Opposition Business represents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But if those opposite want to vote in a moment that we don't take any action on climate change this week, go for it. It's their democratic right, and I will always defend the democratic rights of members of this chamber, even when they are so determined to be wrong.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="138932" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  I rise to speak on the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. Almost eight months ago, on the Friday after the last sitting of 2021, the now Prime Minister and his now Minister for Climate Change and Energy stood up to announce the emissions reduction target that the government seeks to legislate today. With great fanfare the then opposition leader announced, 'Labor's plan to create jobs, cut power bills and reduce emissions.' He lauded not one but two targets backed by 'the most comprehensive modelling ever done for any policy by any opposition in Australia's history since Federation'. There were two targets: (1) an emissions reduction target; and (2) a target on prices. They say it was fully costed but, again, the now Prime Minister said, 'It will see electricity prices fall from the current level by $275 for household by 2025, at the end of our first term.' I draw the House's attention to the words 'from the current level' and 'at the end of our first term'. The Prime Minister's promise to cut power bills appears in the first sentence of Labor's Powering Australia plan, the policy document that they now seek to legislate. The same promise to cut power prices by $275 appeared on the ALP's official website, on social media tiles and on Labor's election advertising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The words that Labor had chosen in its policy document and throughout the campaign were very deliberate ones. They always spoke about reducing people's power prices in conjunction with reducing emissions, as if the two would always go hand in hand. Together, they formed the promise of this government. Now of course we know that Labor won the election, assuring people they would solve cost-of-living problems, problems that have only compounded enormously since they came to office. When asked how a new government could ease cost-of-living pressures the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the energy minister and many more in Labor's ranks responded with that same promise: Labor will reduce emissions while cutting household power bills by $275. It was the most tangible example of cost-of-living relief that the Labor Party offered. But that all changed last week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first question time on day one of business for the 47th Parliament of Australia, the Prime Minister confirmed what many had started to suspect: he would no longer stand by his promise to the families of Australia to cut their power bills by $275. This abandonment of Labor's election commitment coincidentally, or maybe not so coincidentally, came on the very same day that Labor introduced the legislation that is now before the House. Remember, Labor's policy consisted of those two targets: one for emissions reduction of 43 per cent and one for a price reduction of $275. But one of these targets is missing from the bill. Is it the 43 per cent that is missing or the $275? Of course the $275 target—poof, gone—miraculously disappeared from Labor's commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second reading speech the Minister for Climate Change and Energy couldn't even bring himself to address the issue of prices, not once, let alone that commitment, that promise of $275 for households. The bills, as the House would know, require the minister to make an annual statement on the progress towards meeting its climate change policies. You might think that the requirement of the minister would be stated in the bill to also refer to prices—the impact that the implementation of its policy will have on prices for households and for businesses. But, again, there's nothing there. There's absolutely nothing whatsoever in the requirement for the annual statement that relates to the economy or prices. There is a requirement also for the Climate Change Authority to consider progress towards the climate policies. But is there anything there about the Climate Change Authority looking at prices? No, there's nothing on that either. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Prime Minister's and ministers' abandonment of the promise to reduce prices for Australian households and businesses was not enough for people in the Labor ranks to realise there was a problem, last week's release of the ACCC report should have set off alarm bells. This report tells us that energy prices are going to stay high for at least 18 months. Based on the feeble response from this Prime Minister and his resources and energy ministers to date, I regret to inform members of this House that those high prices are likely to persist for much, much longer than the ACCC is forecasting. This is simply because the government is not taking action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will not deliver electricity reductions. It will not deliver on its plan to reduce electricity prices. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy won't even get on the phone to the gas companies to safeguard his first election commitment. It should be his No. 1 KPI, but he refuses to act. That is because the minister does not believe in gas. That is on the record. Plans to invest in new gas pipelines and supply are, according to the minister, 'BS' and a 'fraud'. He simply won't tell the gas companies to get more gas into the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind those opposite that supply is the answer to high prices. More gas into the east coast market will disconnect domestic prices from overseas prices. But this legislation surrenders all negotiating levers. Here's the rub: if this government can't get gas prices down then it has no hope of achieving its electricity price target. It will be on the government as people and businesses pay more for energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this legislation goes further than that. The bills ensure that investment in opening up new gas supply to get prices down and safeguard our energy security will never come. The Prime Minister, his ministers and his government have capitulated to the Greens at the very first opportunity. There are no safeguards in these bills for consumers and energy users—none whatsoever. 'But wait,' says the minister. 'This legislation will give businesses certainty.' If you are a traditional emissions intensive industry then the only certainty you'll have from this legislation and from this government, particularly if you are, let's say, in agriculture, is that Labor is not going to help you. This government will not support you and it is happy to see your prices go up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't go to Export Finance Australia seeking support to tap into new markets overseas, not if you are an energy intensive business. Don't approach the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund to get financing or equity. Don't approach Infrastructure Australia to seek prioritisation of new infrastructure projects. Why? Because you will be in a queue behind less emissions intensive projects, probably in urban areas, because these bills place a requirement on these agencies to ensure that the target of the government is taken into account when they are now doing their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean for households and large businesses? For supermarkets, bakeries, butchers, manufacturers and aluminium smelters, the only certainty they have is that the government has abandoned its promise to cut power prices in the middle of a global energy crisis, no less, just eight months after adopting very specific targets to deliver price reductions. This carries through to every single small business right across the country, which are the lifeblood of so many communities. The government promised to reduce prices. They have reneged. They are introducing climate change legislation, despite the fact that their own policy states that it should include price reductions. Our traditional energy and resource industries, our agricultural industry and even the development of a new critical minerals industry aren't the priorities for this government. The message of this government is 'Go elsewhere and take with you the jobs, the capital and the opportunities that would otherwise come forth.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have very serious concerns about the unintended consequences of these bills, and I will come to those in a moment. There is something else that honourable members of this House should not be fooled into believing, and that is that these bills are about a 43 per cent emissions reduction target. They are not. How the Senate or the House of Representatives deal with the bills will not make one iota of difference to this country's 2030 or 2050 targets, because they have already been formally adopted by this government under the Paris Agreement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of this government's first acts in office was to draw up a new nationally determined contribution, NDC—the formal statement of Australia's commitment to a target. They have already finalised it and they communicated it to the United Nations nearly two months ago, on 16 June. Our nation's target is already set—43 per cent by 2030, regardless of the views of anyone in this parliament, the media or the community. This explains why the minister has been at pains over recent weeks to tell the Australian public that this legislation is in fact unnecessary. That is because 43 per cent is already the target for Australia, and this legislation will have no impact on it whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something, though, that we need to make clear. If this legislation is not so much about the number 43, then why should we be concerned? We should be concerned because there are problems with the legislation. The issue here is not the number, because that's irrelevant to the debate—the minister has told us that. The issue is with the legislation itself. The Prime Minister and his Minister for Climate Change and Energy, in rushing to introduce this to the parliament, haven't thought through the second and third broader consequences of the legislation. Experience overseas shows that, when you legislate emissions reduction targets, you risk handing control over projects, not targets, to activists—otherwise known in some spheres as green lawfare. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an effort to do a deal with the Greens and to give the Greens just enough to secure their support, this government has overreached. It has overreached by introducing new restrictions on the exercise of Commonwealth executive power, which is exactly what the Greens like—restrictions on the government's ability in decision-making for and prioritisation of Export Finance Australia, Infrastructure Australia and the NAIF. They've done this in the innocently titled 'consequential amendments bill'. That is where these changes lie. The bill makes the achievement of Australia's 2030 targets and reducing global emissions an objective or function of 14 different agencies and statutory schemes. We have to remember that we cannot continue to reduce the ability of EFA. If EFA does not have the flexibility to invest in infrastructure projects, including, say, in the Pacific, with the new fuel terminal in Fiji, we put at risk our national security objectives. Do you think other Pacific powers will hamstring themselves as this government is suggesting Australia would? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  Remember when former Prime Minister Morrison called his own government a muppet show? Do you remember that? Seems he was right about one thing, because, honestly, the member for Fairfax has just spent 15 minutes inventing his own reality. That was an extraordinary speech which had nothing to do with what we're debating today: the actual legislation and the facts of what is happening to the climate in this world and this country. If you wanted to stand up in this parliament and announce to everyone that you're a muppet, you'd give the speech that we have just heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022, puts in place Labor's climate change policy that we took to the last election. I have to admit that, for the first, I don't know, five minutes, maybe, of the member for Fairfax's speech, I thought there may be a chance he was supporting the legislation, because he did set out the fact that we put before the Australian people the most robust climate change policy that has ever been put to the Australian people. It has been modelled by one of the most respected environmental economic firms in the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We put it to the Australian people with all of the details well before the election so that they could scrutinise it and understand it and so that it would be clear, when we went to the election on 21 May, that if they were voting for Labor they were voting for real action on climate change. They were voting for an emissions reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030, for 82 per cent of the energy going into the grid to be from renewable energy by 2030 and for energy prices to reduce by 2025, as the member for Fairfax pointed out, not in the first nine weeks of this government—the first nine weeks where, by the way, what did we find out? Oh, that's right. We found that the government that the member for Fairfax was a member of hid from the Australian people before the election a report about energy prices going up. It's extraordinary.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just extraordinary that we have an opportunity here in Australia, for the first time in almost a decade, for people to come into this parliament and say to those schoolchildren who are up there watching me speak: 'We have your future in our minds. We have your future at the forefront of the decisions that we are making about how we deal with emissions so that when you're our age you can live in an environment that somewhat resembles the environment we got to live in when we were your age.' For the first time in a decade, members in this parliament have an opportunity to come into this place and say to the schoolchildren up there and in our electorates: 'We have your employment future at the forefront of our minds. We are thinking about how to give you the opportunity to have well-paid, interesting, secure jobs in a renewable energy industry in Australia which makes us a renewable energy superpower and allows you to work in a way that gives back to the community, as well as supports you and your family.'</span>

Imagine squandering that opportunity. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really hope that the last person to do that in this parliament, in this debate, is the member for Fairfax. But I have a sneaky suspicion he might just be at the head of the cavalcade of people that, apparently, did not listen to what the Australian people were telling them on 21 May when they turned up to vote; when they voted for 77 members of this place to be from the Labor Party, which had a comprehensive climate change policy; and when they voted for a crossbench that campaigned for action on climate change and reduced the muppet show to a small group of people on the other side of the chamber. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe you'd sit for at least a moment and think to yourselves, 'Perhaps we're on the wrong side of history here.' Maybe they did and then they thought, 'I know how we'll fix it: we'll bring in nuclear energy'—which blows the mind of anyone who has ever thought about it deeply for any period of time. I came in here wanting to give a really positive speech, but obviously the member for Fairfax ruined that for me. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, truly, a moment in history. There aren't that many times in this parliament, if we're all honest, when we're debating legislation and issues that can fundamentally change the course of the future, not just for our communities, not just for our country, but for our contribution to the region and the world. There are not that many opportunities—there were none whatsoever in the last nine years—but this is one of those opportunities. </span>

It's a privilege, it's a responsibility and it's an opportunity to listen to what the Australian public have been saying to us and to act in the way that they want us to act. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I campaigned hard on Labor's climate change policy in my electorate. I talked about the climate emergency and reducing emissions, and a cleaner, better future. I talked about the employment opportunities that will come from becoming a renewable energy superpower. I talked about the fact that we can have a modern economy and be part of changing the course of the future for the better. And that's what my community voted for. That's what they voted for, and that's what this legislation will deliver.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what this legislation also does? It imposes accountability on government and on this parliament that we have never seen before. The member for Fairfax raised that the minister has talked about the fact that this legislation is not necessary to set a target. Well, of course it is not. We had all sorts of vague targets under the last government. You know what this legislation does? It holds the government to account for getting to that target. That is the part of the legislation he did not talk about. He didn't talk about the part of this legislation that says that there has to be an annual address to the parliament by the climate change minister to ensure that the government of the day is required to update the parliament and the country on the progress we are making to meet our climate goals. This legislation includes a mechanism to hold governments to account, including our government, because we believe in accountability and we believe in transparency and we believe that, if you say to the Australian people, 'We are going to do something,' you should get held to account about whether or not you do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Authority will assess and publish progress against our targets and will advise the government on future targets. It will be a Climate Change Authority that will have expertise and responsibility, and it will be restored to what it was meant to be after the damage that has been done to it over the last nine years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reasonable people can have a debate where they don't agree. Not everyone comes into this place with the same views about what the science says. But you can't anymore stand here and say that the science is wrong about the impacts of the changing climate. You cannot live in our country and see the devastation of the bushfires and the floods—you cannot see the weather events that are supposed to happen once in 100 years happening year after year with an intensity and an impact that is greater than we have ever seen before—and deny that the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere is impacting our climate unless you invent your own reality, and we weren't sent here to invent our own realities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I urge every member of this parliament to think about which side of history they want to be on and how they will be viewed in the decades to come, when the young people who are sitting up in that gallery watching this debate and other young people in our community are our age and they are looking back at the decisions that were made that impacted the environment and the jobs and the economy that they inherited from us.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I rise to speak on the Climate Change Bill 2022. I welcome the government's initiative in bringing this bill forward as a priority for this parliament. We need to lock into law Australia's commitment to net zero and a process of accountability on how we will get there. But let's be clear. This is not comprehensive legislation to address climate change and it is certainly not as detailed as the climate change bill that I tabled in the last parliament and that enjoyed the support of so many areas of our community. This is a climate targets bill. It is silent on mechanisms to achieve the targets. It is silent on requirements for the government to conduct climate risk assessments and table adaptation plans to meet those risks. It does not include a ratchet mechanism or consecutive budgets to set a clear road map to net zero. It heavily relies on the Paris Agreement, which I would argue can be disrupted by geopolitical conflicts, and so could impact that process to net zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does, let's be very clear, is set into law the government's commitment to achieve 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030, and I will address the shortcomings of that target in a moment. It sets into law a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. It provides for the minister to report annually to parliament on progress towards those targets, and it provides for the minister to seek advice from the Climate Change Authority more regularly, with a minimum of once every five years. I should say, with respect to the Climate Change Authority, that it needs an overhaul. What we've seen is a loading of the Climate Change Authority with too many people from the fossil fuel industry, rather than climate scientists. We need to make sure that, within that authority, we don't have vested interests pushing a further reliance on gas, rather than scientists focusing on global warming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also provision that the operations of this bill will be reviewed within five years of it passing. The Climate Change (Consequential Amendments Bill) 2022 implements a need to consider climate change in 14 other pieces of legislation across different portfolios. This is incredibly important, because this is where you get down to the detail. I do have an issue. In some circumstances there's a question. Some bills may consider this legislation and the impact of climate, such as the NAIF, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, funding, yet the legislation fails to include the EPBC Act, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. So I think it will be incredibly important to understand where those consequential amendments are and ensure they are effective. But I welcome the commitment, in the explanatory memorandum of the bill, that the minister will conduct continuous reviews over the next year to identify and incorporate the implications of the climate change bill into additional associated pieces of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So much has actually been achieved today. The engagement from the minister with the members, including the community metro Independents, if I may describe some of my fellow crossbenchers that way, in trying to move away from the media's obsession with 'teal', has been very welcome, and unprecedented in my experience so far in this parliament. Along with these fellow Independents, we've embraced the opportunity to improve this legislation through collaborative efforts with the government and the minister. We've wholeheartedly engaged in this process and we've been able to insert into the bill some key language from the initial draft that the House is now considering prior to the bill being tabled. Elements inserted reflect concerns that have been raised by our communities and those who have voted to put us here—specifically, that the objects of the bill should reflect that science is the driver for emissions reduction, and the goal of keeping warming to less than two degrees, and ideally to 1.5 degrees, needs to be based on scientific advice. The government has agreed to insert a note in relation to clause 10 of the bill to reflect that 43 per cent is a floor, not a ceiling—that is, it is a minimum ambition—and in relation to the wording in clause 10(6) to clarify that the nationally determined contributions must be more ambitious than the previous indices. We need to make sure we keep progressing. We cannot slip backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has agreed to insert greater clarity around ministerial reporting requirements and introduce a new section to the bill which reflects the need for the review of the efficacy of the legislation within five years. I should say, and I welcome, that discussions are continuing with the minister to continue improving some of the elements. I anticipate that further amendments will be moved at consideration in detail to reflect this. I will keep a close eye on the progress of the review of the consequential amendments bill to ensure not only that all necessary associated acts and bodies are captured but also that those added and existing acts considered include language strong enough to drive genuine action. 'May' is not good enough. We need 'must'. We must consider climate impacts of projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some things missing. What I said at the outset is that this is not quite the full climate change legislation that I feel should be tabled. Some of the areas that have been missed that could be strengthened include a requirement for national risk assessments; a requirement for the government to produce adaptation plans to ensure that we address risk and keep our communities and way of life safe; a requirement for the minister to set emissions budgets regularly to provide individuals, business and industry with the certainty that is needed to drive investment; and a requirement for the minister to produce detailed plans, sector by sector, on how and where emissions reductions are going to be achieved, in particular from energy, transport, industry, agriculture and our built and residential world. There are so many sectors that need to be impacted and that need to progress, and we get stuck all too often on the debate around energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Missing in this legislation, importantly, is the need to consider the transition for workers and communities that will be most impacted by the transition, because some traditional industries and jobs will go. So they need a plan, and that plan needs to be a minimum of five years out to have a chance at that transition. We also know that communities are incredibly exposed, and they need to adapt as well. Changing and increasing disasters are making those communities unsafe. Their way of life and their economies: everything comes to a standstill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, this bill is very important. It is progress towards genuine climate action, which was one of the key drivers for me entering politics in the first place. The major parties did not even recognise in 2019 the need to commit to net zero by 2050. I welcome the shift that occurred during the course of the last parliament. I would say that community voices have been effective in demanding greater action and commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Global warming is the greatest challenge of our time. We've been on notice for over 30 years, clearly, yet we have failed to find the political will to implement the solutions. It's in stark contrast to the way the world mobilised around CFCs and the hole in the ozone layer. We've had this warning on global warming and yet this complete political inability to act. We must not be the generation that had all the facts but failed to act. So many in our communities want to see change. We have an obligation to our planet, to our children and to future generations to do everything within our power to limit global warming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and the government are settling for 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030—motivated, I would say, not by science but by politics. So I urge the government to increase its ambition. I accept that the government has heard, in some way, our calls, in the language of saying that it is a floor and not a ceiling. But more needs to be done. We have constant reminders of the need for action: the bushfires of 2019; the multiple flood events this year; the rising sea levels already impacting the islands in the Torres Strait, battering our coastline—particularly the east coast; and the bleaching events of the precious coral at the Great Barrier Reef, with heat waves and temperature records being broken time and time again. We cannot continue using up global carbon budgets. It's a compounding system, and what we do in this decade is incredibly important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Significant emissions reductions must be achieved this decade. The <span style="font-style:italic;">State of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the environment </span>report released last month found that we are in a rapidly changing climate, with unsustainable development and use of resources. The general outlook for our environment is deteriorating. The government made much of that report, but now it needs to act on recommendations that actually give effect to the concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The environmental decline affects the wellbeing of Australians. Changes are already baked into our climate. Immediate action, with innovative management and collaboration, can turn things around, but the government must find the political will to do that. It will have support from communities like mine, like Warringah. We want to see ambition on this because every one degree of warming increases humidity by seven per cent and increases the strength and frequency of storms and floods that ravage and devastate our communities. The International Energy Agency, a body founded for fossil fuel extraction, developed a road map to net zero by 2050 and released it last year. It said that we need to rapidly transition and that there can be no new coal, oil or gas projects approved if we are to achieve a net zero ambition. I urge the government and the Prime Minister to accept and hear that advice, because the government continues to fall short on this, refusing to stop approving more oil, coal and gas projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They argue that these projects are mostly for export and will not impact Australia's emissions reduction targets. But I would say that this is the drug dealer argument: somehow we are not responsible for damage caused by fossil fuel exports down the road. It ignores that the ultimate purpose of the Paris Agreement is to limit warming. Emissions and impact do not recognise, or stop at, borders. Disasters will not discriminate. We will all be impacted by the choices the government makes. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report showed that current global policy puts the world on a course of at least 2.1 degrees of warming by 2100, and possibly as much as 3.9 degrees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australia is predicted to warm more than the global average. We should transition rapidly. This shouldn't really be a debate. Our duty has to be to our children and future generations to ensure they have a prosperous economy, businesses and way of life. To all of those who worry about the economic impacts, I say: communities ravaged by floods and bushfires are not economically productive. You do not continue operating businesses. Everything comes to a standstill. The cost is huge. Over the last three years alone, disasters have cost the budget over $10 billion in direct assistance and immeasurable other impacts. We can't even begin to put a real price and real cost on the impacts on people's lives and the emotions, the stress, the anxiety and the pain caused—and the displacement for communities who don't know if it is viable to remain living where they are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The frustrating part is also that we are failing to position Australia as a world leader with the new economic opportunities in the clean energy world. So many in Warringah and around Australia are frustrated that we are being held back from this transition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will go some way to driving confidence and investment. The global capital pool for investment is over $1.7 trillion per annum and growing. Australia is missing out on that owing to policy uncertainty. So the first step of this is to be able to do that. I promised the people of Warringah that I would continue to be a climate leader: to push for greater ambition and to work with the government and to encourage them to be more ambitious. There is a five-step plan that clearly shows a sensible road map to net zero. We are talking about reining in the cost of living, which is big at the moment and is having a huge impact on households. We have no hope of reining in cost-of-living impacts without climate action. Just think: food, fuel and insurance. Climate disasters are the major contributor to cost spikes in all of those sectors. In the last three years, we have seen that just absolutely blow out. So it is entirely disingenuous to raise the costs of action against the imperative of why we need to do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome this legislation, and I hope that we are going to legislate these targets in this parliament. I urge the government to focus on transforming energy to 80 per cent renewables by 2030. We need to clean up transport, modernise industry and regenerate Australia. We have to stop cutting down trees. It really is that simple. I congratulate and I welcome this legislation, but I urge greater action. </span>

I've spoken before in this place about the fact that my classmates and I never would have dreamt that at this point in our history—many, many years later—I would be standing here in a parliament and crying out for urgent action on climate change and that we would be in a parliament that was essentially doing nothing. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So today, as part of the new Albanese Labor government, I am incredibly proud that one of the first pieces of legislation that we're moving in our first sittings is to enshrine in legislation our ambitious climate targets. I am incredibly proud that I finally get to give a speech in this place that is about actually taking that climate action, actually doing it. It is a great moment, and I do it on behalf of all the constituents in Canberra who have raised this issue with me time and time again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even this morning, before coming in here to vote, I was out the front meeting with a group of young people from the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, who handed me some letters that they had written about this. It is very much for future generations and for young people that we need to take this urgent action, for our future as a world, as humanity. </span>

Again, I am so proud that today we begin climate action as a government. It is an incredibly important step, because we finally have a government that is willing to face up to climate action as one of the most pressing and urgent issues we face today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will create certainty and send the message that the government has a stable and clear policy. It will end nine years of wasted opportunities and failures by three prime ministers and 22 abandoned energy policies. I thank all the members whose hard work and determination in the face of cynical politics over the past decade have brought us here today. Let's hope that this bill marks the death knell of a decade of inaction and the treatment of climate as a political football, because, in the words of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, 'We are facing a code red for humanity if we don't act now.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report found that, even in the most ambitious scenario, which the world is failing to stick to, global warming would likely hit 1.5 degrees Celsius around 2035. The IPCC report said that many of the effects of that warming had particular relevance to Australia. Sea levels around Australia, which have already risen higher than the global average, are set to continue rising. Fires are projected to get worse and more frequent, and fire seasons will last longer. Heavy rainfall and river floods are projected to worsen across Australasia, and droughts will also worsen. The <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment</span> report released last week by my colleague Tanya Plibersek, the Minister for the Environment and Water, revealed that since the early 20th century average Australian land temperatures have already increased by 1.4 degrees Celsius. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia contributes approximately 1.2 per cent of global emissions of greenhouse gases. This places us among the top 15 total emitters, and we are among the world's largest per-person emitters. Australians know this, and they made it very clear at the election that they want a government that will tackle this challenge head on, with urgency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituents in Canberra have been very vocal in their desire for real climate action, and I'm happy to be delivering on our promise. The need for action has become all the more urgent as we are now living through the effects of climate change. Record-breaking droughts, bushfires, floods, storms or other extreme weather events are becoming more and more common, and in the last three years we had one of the worst droughts on record. It was so severe that in 2019 the Murray-Darling experienced its lowest water level on record. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, there were the Black Summer bushfires, and I have spoken about them many times in this place. Canberrans will never forget the choking smoke that blanketed Canberra for weeks. Canberra's air quality was hazardous for 34 days over a two-month period. We had the worst air quality in the world. It was a genuine health crisis in its own right. I'm not sure how well known outside of Canberra it was, but our city was essentially shut down for many of those days, and the advice was to stay in your home and use air conditioning if you had it. Of course, many didn't have access to it. The advice for many was to relocate if you had underlying health conditions or if you were a pregnant woman, and of course many couldn't do that either. People were wearing masks before that became a commonplace thing because of COVID. It was certainly a very difficult time for all in the region, and one that my constituents won't forget. The long-term impacts of that are difficult to measure, but, for the mothers who listened to the choking coughs of their infants, that trauma will remain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nationally, the fires burned through more than eight million hectares of native vegetation. It is estimated that one to three billion animals were killed or displaced. Three thousand homes were destroyed and 33 people lost their lives. Then the fires turned to floods. Thousands of Australians have been forced to flee their homes, and more than two dozen have been killed as the east coast of Australia has recorded record rainfall and flooding. People are still piecing their lives together. Overseas, we are seeing record-breaking heat waves and fires in Europe and North America. These are the effects of the climate crisis in action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it isn't just our climate that is hurting Australians. We're also being hit with the economic cost of the policy paralysis that we have seen over the last decade. The community is crying out for the energy policy certainty necessary to move forward from the Taylor-made energy crisis currently hitting the hip pockets of Australian families.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proof of the power of renewable energy can be seen outside this House. Two years ago, right here in the national capital, we became the first city outside Europe to run on 100 per cent renewable electricity. In fact, the ACT is the only jurisdiction in the National Electricity Market where prices will drop. While the rest of the country is bracing for soaring energy prices as a result of the former coalition government's policy vacuum, Canberrans will save an average of $23 a year on their electricity bills. In comparison, across the border in New South Wales, power bills are expected to jump by between 8.5 and 18.3 per cent. Imagine what could be achieved with a little national leadership—and we know, because we have modelled it!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our policy is based on the most comprehensive modelling that an opposition has ever done on any policy issue. Upgrading the electricity grid will fix energy transmission and drive down power prices by providing the country with more renewables, more transmission and more storage. Firm renewables are the cheapest form of energy. Getting more renewables into the system will put downward pressure on power prices while also reducing Australia's emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands that climate action is good for the planet, good for future generations, good for household budgets and good for Australia's prosperity. The fact that this bill is before the House in our very first sitting fortnight speaks to Labor's commitment to doing our bit globally in the fight for a more habitable planet. Australia is out of the naughty corner and back at the international table. Globally, our reputation has been damaged by the past decade of denial and delay on climate change, and the subsequent chaos on renewables and energy. This bill ends that lost decade by giving business, industry, energy investors and the wider community the leadership and certainty so desperately needed. They want certainty so that they can invest in Australia, in renewable energy. No longer will they have to worry about a change of policy at the last minute, like we've seen time and time again over the past 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill enshrines into law our target of 43 per cent emissions reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, and net zero by 2050. It is important to note that these figures are based on what we can achieve that we modelled with that incredibly comprehensive modelling. We didn't work back from a target. This is incredibly ambitious. This will be a lot of hard work. Labor are up for that task, as are Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A 2030 target of 43 per cent has received broad support, including from the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Clean Energy Council, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the National Farmers Federation. This support is so important because the issue of climate change has been politically toxic for a decade. It's time to end the climate wars and to get on with action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Chamber of Commerce and Industry said, the passing of this legislation is 'essential for delivering energy certainty to Australian businesses'. Businesses get it. Environmentalists get it. Unions get it. Farmers get it. It is an ambitious target that charts a credible path to net zero, and it presents Australia with a once-in-a-generation chance, because the world's transition to renewable energy is our economic opportunity. Australia can be a renewable energy superpower by harnessing our solar, wind and skilled energy workforces. We can drive clean manufacturing and energy exports in our region, and Labor will put that opportunity within reach. Our Powering Australia policy will deliver 604,000 jobs across the country and get us to 82 per cent renewables by 2030. I really can't understand anyone who doesn't recognise just how ambitious that is. It will spur $76 billion of private investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While legislation is not essential to deliver our targets in the Powering Australia plan, which we'll get on with anyway, legislating the target is international best practice. It's important to give the certainty that I've spoken about, and it's also important to hold governments, including ours, accountable, because we believe in accountability. We want Australians to know how serious we are about this. This bill will provide the forward momentum and the institutional support needed for ambitious but achievable climate action. We know climate laws enable mitigation action by signalling the direction of national policy, enhancing regulatory certainty, creating focal points for social mobilisation and attracting international finance. We know this because the IPCC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change</span> report recently confirmed it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, legislating our emissions reduction targets into domestic law keeps the promise we made to the Australian people to take action on climate change. It will bring Australia into line with countries such as France, Denmark and Spain that have legislated net zero targets for 2050. Countries such as Canada have also legislated their 2030 target. Our 43 per cent 2030 target restores our international credibility and is comparable with other international partners such as Japan, South Korea and Canada. The 43 per cent reduction is ambitious and, most importantly, we have the plan to get there. Our Powering Australia plan makes the targets achievable. Importantly, it also gives us a chance to overachieve. This is a floor, not a ceiling, and we have said that from when we first announced this policy. If we can do better, we will, but we need to recognise just how ambitious this is. We are really catching up on a decade of lost time, and, as I say, as one of the world's greatest emitters per person, this is no small task, but it is one that we are absolutely and deeply committed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My hope, and Labor's, is that this bill will spark the momentum that we need to work with industry, states and territories, and the Australian people to achieve even greater emissions targets in the coming decade. This is a crucial decade. We are running out of time. This bill will embed the 2030 and 2050 targets in the objects and functions of key clean energy entities such as ARENA and the CEFC, and of agencies that help shape Australia's future, such as Infrastructure Australia, Export Finance Australia, the CSIRO and the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility. This will focus those key agencies to help them contribute to achieving net zero. Importantly, after a decade of deceit and dishonesty, this bill will help rebuild trust in government by restoring transparency and accountability in government action on climate change. It confirms the important role of independent expert advice. Transparency and accountability will be returned by requiring the minister to report to parliament each year on Australia's progress towards meeting the targets set in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge every member of this house to get behind this bill and support this. It is well past time that Australia put in legislation our deep commitment to achieving these targets, and I think that's something that every member of this house would want to be a part of.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  As many in this place are aware, I've long advocated for legislative reform that adequately accommodates our international and moral obligations to address climate change. In the last parliament I was pleased to second the private member's bill by the member for Warringah. But like many attempts to constructively address climate change, that bill was not debated. To the dismay of Australians, successive governments have consistently failed to act. Put simply, we've been living in a political wasteland with respect to climate change. The entire time that I've had the privilege of being the member for Mayo has been incredibly frustrating—and I would also say heartbreaking, when we lost a very good prime minister four years ago as a casualty of the climate wars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've known for several years of the need to act decisively to make sure Australia is in the best position to transition and embrace the plethora of opportunities that a green future presents. We need to set up ambitious targets to drive investment in and take-up of clean technologies. The Australian community want us to act. I know that from personal experience, from the countless emails I receive and from the community events I have hosted in my electorate. The business community of Australia also wants and needs long-awaited certainty. They want a framework that enables them to plan and invest for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not perfect, but it is a responsible step in the right direction. This bill limits emissions reductions to 43 per cent by 2030. Such a target is less than the 50 per cent that I and many others in this place were seeking. We were seeking a little more ambition. But, despite these limitations, the bill provides Australia with the real first opportunity to meet its international obligations and contribute to the global effort of currently tackling climate change. It restores our reputation among our neighbours and those across the globe. Importantly, this bill provides us with the comfort that, finally, after years of political indecision and argument, we will now have legislative targets and mechanisms to enable Australia to meet its moral and international obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election the people of Australia made a very loud and clear statement: they want their lawmakers to act and they want them to act without delay. There's a reason for this. Everyday Australians are experiencing the impact of climate change. Everyone can remember the horrific bushfires of the 2019-20 summer. My community experienced this firsthand—the devastation of intense and fast-moving fires across the Adelaide Hills and Kangaroo Island. The fires on Kangaroo Island were the largest in the island's recorded history and burnt more vegetation than any other fire on the island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After starting on 20 December 2019, the fires were finally declared under control over a month later, on 21 January 2022. The carnage from this event was significant. Two people lost their lives; 56 homes were destroyed; hundreds of other buildings, including a large ecotourism facility, were damaged; 23 firefighters were injured; and two CFS fire trucks were damaged. The fires burnt over 211,000 hectares, almost half of the island, and through one of South Australia's most important ecological sites, the Flinders Chase National Park. The park is home to the endangered Kangaroo Island dunnart and the glossy black-cockatoo. The fires killed an estimated 25,000 koalas and destroyed the habitat of numerous other animals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Adelaide Hills, also on 20 December, we experienced a major fire at Cudlee Creek. The fire spread rapidly, threatening the townships of Mount Pleasant, Springton, Palmer, Mount Torrens, Harrogate, Inglewood, Gumeracha, Lobethal and Woodside. The fire went on to burn 23,000 hectares and resulted in the death of an elderly man, and the destruction of 84 homes and more than 400 outbuildings and 292 vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the lead-up to these fires, South Australia had experienced dangerous fire weather conditions, with strong winds, low humidity and higher temperatures for several days. Nearly the entire state recorded its highest ever accumulated Forrest Fire Danger Index for December. On 20 December the conditions were horrendous. The state had already sweltered through four days of extreme heat—49.9 degrees Celsius in the west of our state and 43.9 degrees in Adelaide. More than 200 bushfires started that day and required more than 1,500 firefighters to respond. Thirty-one firefighters and two police officers were injured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were not alone in this. New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria all experienced significant fires, such that the Insurance Council of Australia declared the fires a catastrophe, enabling related insurance claims to be processed more quickly. The national value of the catastrophe was $2.32 billion, with over 38,000 claimants. Experts advise that climate change is increasing and that the frequency and intensity of bushfires will continue to increase, so we can expect that what we experienced in South Australia and around the country in 2019 and 2020 will continue unless we act collectively and all recognise that this is an urgent issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country is lurching from one natural disaster to another, often with barely enough recovery time between disasters. Unnatural oscillations between fire and flood are now in overdrive. Floods on the east coast this year resulted in tens of thousands of residents being evacuated from their homes and 22 lives being lost. Brisbane had its largest three- and seven-day total rainfall recordings. Mount Glorious received in excess of 1,170 millimetres of rain in a week. Thirty locations across the south-east recorded more than 1,000 millimetres of rain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As of July 2022, the Insurance Council of Australia reported claims in excess of $5 billion, comprising more than 230,000 claims. On 29 October 2021 severe storms swept through South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, causing $839 million in damage and more than 100,000 claims. In the last three years alone the cost of damage caused by fires, floods and storms has exceeded $8 billion. We often hear the argument that we cannot afford a reduction in emissions, but I would say that we cannot afford to go through that again. We need to transition to renewable energy. We need to transition to electric vehicles. There is such opportunity here. It is the opportunity costs from the failure to act for so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been reckless for this parliament to do nothing and it is incumbent on every single one of us to do so much more and to be ambitious for our community. While sitting here today, and now, I look up at the gallery and see young people watching us and the decisions we make. They expect us to be considering their future. The decisions we make today will have an impact on their future long after we are no longer in this place. I urge everyone in this parliament to support these bills. They are not perfect, but let us not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.</span>

For the last decade Australia has had a government that has used the issue of climate change as a political weapon rather than as an issue that we need to come together to solve. The former government was internally divided, and is still divided, over this issue, with some espousing views representative of people who don't even believe that climate change is real. The former government spread fear and misinformation to deceive the Australian people about the state of environmental degradation relating to climate change. The former government's policy stifled investment in renewable energy. They embarrassed our nation in an international context, with policies that represented Australia as not doing its fair share to combat climate change and to put in place policies to ensure that we reduce emissions in a domestic context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the election the Australian people said, 'Enough is enough.' The Australian people know that climate change is real. They still feel the sting in their throat from the horrific bushfires in 2019-20. Some of them are still dealing with the mould and the damp in their homes from the rain inundation we have had over the last couple of years. Climate change is having a direct effect on Australians and their livelihoods now. It is affecting Australian communities, and Australians see that their children's future looks rather bleak unless they have a government that will take climate change seriously and take strong action. They want a government that takes this existential threat seriously and has the mettle to tell the truth to the Australian people about the real threat of climate change and, more importantly, to develop policies that reduce risk in the future. Quite simply, the Australian people want stronger action on climate change, and that is exactly what this bill will deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is being legislated to ensure that we have a target for emissions reductions in the medium and longer terms. But the bill goes further than that. It also ensures that there is accountability to this parliament and to the Australian people for those commitments that are made in the legislation and by the government in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also enhances accountability through an annual statement to parliament on the progress made during the year towards achieving reductions targets—international developments, climate change policy and the effectiveness of the Commonwealth's climate change policies in contributing to the achievement of the targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also boost transparency by requiring independent expert advice from the Climate Change Authority on the annual statements and future targets. The bill requires the advice of the Climate Change Authority to be public and obliges the minister to both take it into account and formally responded to that advice. It provides for regular independent review of the act. The bill will also ensure that Australia keeps setting future targets that meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement and are a progression on our current commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents the will of the Australian people for stronger action on climate change. It's coupled with the other policies that the Albanese Labor government took to the election, most notably Rewiring the Nation; ensuring that we adopt the principles of the Australian Energy Market Operator blueprint for the infrastructure upgrades that need to occur to our transmission network to ensure that they can cater for additional renewables into the system; future-proofing that transmission network to cater for those renewables; and investing in solar banks so that people who have typically been priced out of the market when it comes to access to solar energy, most notably renters and low-income households, get that access to renewable energy for their households into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that batteries are the technology that is revolutionising the ability to store power generated from solar, particularly during the day and into the evening, but we know that they are expensive. This government is acting to ensure that it invests in community batteries in the future so that 10,000 households will have access to that storage capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing in energy apprenticeships. We want to make sure that Australians have the skills in the future to do the jobs of the future. We all know that in international investment markets companies are now moving into the renewable energy space at the rate of knots, but we need to make sure that we have the skills capacity to deliver that revolution in the future. Our new energy skills program will do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government thought that electric vehicles were a political tool that they could weaponise and use against the Labor Party in election campaigns. We all remember former Prime Minister Morrison saying that the electric vehicle would 'destroy the weekend' and that it would be the end of the day for tradies. We know that that's rubbish. The Australian people know that that's rubbish. They know that car manufacturers are now moving to manufacture electric vehicles and are phasing out internal combustion engines for their fleets in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people also knew that they weren't getting access to those electric vehicles under the former government because they were too expensive, because the former government never had a commitment to putting in place policies to promote the uptake of electric vehicles in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government not only is putting in place policies to reduce the cost of electric vehicles by removing some of the taxes that are associated with electric vehicles but, more importantly, is sending a signal to international markets and to car manufacturers that the Australian government and the Australian people are serious about investment in electric vehicles into the future, that we see this as the future when it comes to transport in this country. We want access to more brands of electric vehicles in Australia, and that is what our policies will do. We are also implementing a safeguard mechanism for the 200-odd biggest polluting companies in Australia that produce more than 100,000 tons of emissions each year to ensure that they reduce those emissions into the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these policies will spur investment in renewable energy in Australia and provide us with the opportunity to realise the potential and the comparative advantage that Australia has that other nations don't—access to sunlight and wind—to spur a renewable energy revolution in our country. Australia has one of the best environments for the use and the uptake of renewable energy of any nation throughout the world because of our long summer days and our windy coastlines. It is a comparative advantage that we should be taking advantage of but had not been under the previous government. These policies represent the new government and the Australian people taking advantage of that comparative edge that we have when it comes to our natural environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These policies will also boost research in renewable energy and new technologies throughout this country. I am very proud to have the University of New South Wales and the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics based in my electorate. The research undertaken and the technology at UNSW is mind blowing. Of all the solar panels produced throughout the world, 90 per cent of them have Australian technology that was invented, produced and commercialised at the University of New South Wales. That is something that we should be enormously proud of as a nation. Solar panel technology was basically invented here in Australia yet the previous government did not do much to promote that or to provide opportunities for growth in that area. Well, that is changing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently the new minister, Chris Bowen, and I visited the University of New South Wales to announce $45 million of ARENA funding for the Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics to continue its important work in improving the efficiency of solar panels throughout the world. It is ground-breaking research. On several occasions the University of New South Wales has broken the world record for the conversion of sunlight into energy. We want to make sure that a research institute like that with such a proud record of delivering can continue to innovate and deliver new technology into the future and, more importantly, that it is backed by the Australian people. It is something that we can be proud of and promote, not only domestically but internationally as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, these new policies will create jobs. They will ensure that we are investing in the jobs of the future for Australians. I want to also point out that these policies have rather large implications for restoring our international credibility and for playing a constructive leadership role, particularly in the Pacific. In Pacific island nations, climate change is viewed as the single greatest threat to the livelihoods of people living there. Climate change is a threat from which no-one and no country is immune.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The security implications of climate change are clear and cannot be ignored. That's why climate change cooperation is now a hallmark of the Australia-United States alliance. When the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence met with their US counterparts in July, both acknowledged the critical importance of enhancing diplomatic, economic and security investments in the Indo-Pacific, including addressing the threat of climate change. That was reinforced during the Indo-Pacific Chiefs of Defense Conference, co-hosted by the United States Indo-Pacific Command in Sydney last month and attended by military leaders from 27 countries. Discussions there centred on the security implications of climate change, as well as conflicts in the Indo-Pacific and Ukraine. I was fortunate to address the closing dinner to that conference, and I highlighted the new era we're now entering of collaboration with our regional partners and neighbours and, in particular, that the Albanese Labor government will ensure our relationships are underpinned by respect and a genuine partnership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That goes to ensuring that we are partnering and working together, particularly within our region of the Pacific, on combating the effects of climate change. It's important that we highlight that because it has deep ramifications for Australia's standing within the Pacific and in other international fora. That is why this government is taking this issue so seriously. That is why we are legislating these medium-term targets and longer-term targets that are contained in this bill but, more importantly, why we are putting in place the mechanisms to ensure accountability to this parliament and to the Australian people for the delivery of those commitments. As I said at the outset, this is all about ensuring that we take stronger action on climate change as a nation and that we are true to our kids' future and deliver them a cleaner, safer environment.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SCAMPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  It is with joy that I stand in the House to debate the Climate Change Bill 2022. This is a historic moment, and it is a pleasure that this is the first bill I will speak on as a member of the 47th Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of climate change is the reason I stood for parliament, and it was expressed as the top issue of concern when I listened to the people of Mackellar around their kitchen tables and at the polling booths. I feel a deep responsibility to push for the strongest laws possible. We have a responsibility to all current and future Australians to pass a bill which delivers strong action on climate change into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a long record of failed attempts to get climate policy right. It has been a lost decade—lost to partisan division and the politicisation of an issue that should be a simple matter of science. But today is an opportunity to start moving our country forward again and to build a bright future, rather than hanging onto the fossil-fuel past that is killing us and our ecosystems slowly. We owe a debt to the future generations to pass this bill. What else are we here for? This bill is but one step, and we have many more steps to take. But this is progress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This remarkable moment would not have happened without the trailblazing of the member for Warringah. The bill we are debating today originated in 2020 when the climate act adaptation and mitigation bill was introduced to parliament. The member for Warringah's bill took inspiration from the UK Climate Change Act, passed in 2008, which itself was inspired by a private member's bill that was moved by a UK crossbencher in the House of Commons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the decade since the UK climate act passed, emissions have decreased by 29 per cent, and they have put their debilitating debate behind them. In the UK, there is multipartisan consensus on the need for action. Their climate legislation sent ripples around the world. Many countries now have their own climate change act. Australia is finally about to follow. For over 2½ years the member for Warringah persevered and prosecuted the argument for an Australian climate change act. We are finally here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's bill enshrines Australia's greenhouse gas emission targets: 43 per cent on the 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050. It provides for annual climate change statements to be made by the climate change minister to the parliament and will confer new advisory functions on the Climate Change Authority, the government's independent adviser on climate policy. This bill will improve accountability, integrity and transparency in climate policy that was sorely missed under the last government. It will ensure climate policy is best practice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud the minister for taking a collaborative and consultative approach to the development of this bill. It has set the direction and tone of parliament. The government invited amendment suggestions from the crossbench, and I'm pleased that several of these proposed amendments have made their way into this bill. This is a new way of doing politics. It is what our communities have sent us here for, setting aside division to work together in the national interest. Experience has shown us that to make climate policy enduring there needs to be multipartisan consensus. The people of Australia sent a clear message at the recent election that they want concrete action on climate change now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Renewable energy is the cheapest form of electricity and the energy of the future. A transition to renewable energy and storage will lead to lower electricity prices for businesses and families across the country, and, being generated here in Australia for Australians, will lead to greater energy security. This bill will unlock private investment in the high-tech, clean energy and clean manufacturing sectors that have been inhibited by the uncertainty of the last 10 years. These industries will be the backbone of Australia's prosperity into the future. This bill has the backing of the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and many others. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the CSIRO released a report detailing the impacts of inaction on climate. We will see higher insurance premiums and food costs and we are already feeling the effects of previously mismanaged energy policy, with Australian businesses folding under the pressure of skyrocketing gas prices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must build accountability measures into this legislation to ensure future governments keep Australia on the right track for a strong future. I'm pleased to say that the crossbench, working with the government, has ensured that there are now some safeguard provisions built in. The crossbench has successfully prosecuted the argument for strong objects, a statutory review after five years and 10 years thereafter; a guarantee that the 2030 target will be a floor, not a ceiling; and clearer reporting by and advice from the Climate Change Authority. But I told the people of Mackellar that I would fight for strong action on climate change, so the work is not yet done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent body tasked with providing advice and recommendations under this bill is the Climate Change Authority. Established under the Climate Change Authority Act in 2011, it was designed to be an impartial adviser to government. The UK climate committee, on which it is based, has been a circuit breaker, cutting through their divisive debates which risked stalling action. The Climate Change Authority was successful until the Abbott government cut staff, limited its mandate and never sought its advice. Over 10 years of coalition governments, it was stacked with friends of the party and vested interests. If we are to trust the advice of our authority, it needs to be unbiased. Those members with long histories working for fossil fuel companies should be moved on. The climate debates will not be over until our 2030 and 2050 targets are in line with the science, and it's clear what we must do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also lacks a target review mechanism that would allow for an increase in the ambition in line with the science, if required. A review mechanism would ensure that the 2030 target is reviewed by the authority after three years and the 2050 target is reviewed every time a nationally determined contribution is communicated. A target review mechanism would allow the minister to ratchet up the target in line with the advice via a non-disallowable instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a lack of consequences in this bill for failure to meet the targets. Whilst the coalition claims that this bill will open the way for litigation, that is not true. I would recommend a requirement similar to the one in the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, where, if targets are not met, the government would be obliged to outline to the House the emergency steps they will take to overcome the shortfall. The bill also does not establish a legislative process for effective policymaking on climate adaptation. We know that our economy and nature will be hit. We need to prepare now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the consequential bill extends the targets to the operations and functions designated under several other acts. This is welcome, but there are a few very large gaps. Firstly, it does not extend to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This means the minister does not have to consider climate targets when assessing major fossil fuel projects. The government's 2030 target avoids 366 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. If all new gas mines and coalmines are approved and start running, they will cause 1,030 million tonnes of emissions domestically and over 11 billion tonnes overseas when the fuels are burned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the targets do not extend to the Industry Research and Development Act. You may know this act as one former energy ministers used to establish programs like the subsidies for fracking in the Beetaloo basin and the Underwriting New Generation Investments program. Both had serious integrity issues and were not in line with our climate goals. Thirdly, the consequential bill does not compel agencies to act in accordance with the targets, only to take them into consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't forget that there are many local heroes from Mackellar who through their consistent advocacy for climate action have contributed to realising this moment of the bills being introduced: Greg Mullins, former fire chief and founding member of Emergency Leaders for Climate Action; Tim Silverwood, co-founder of Ocean Impact Organisation and creator of Take 3 for the Sea; Kat Kimmorley, who now works for Boundless, Mike Cannon-Brookes's philanthropic organisation; Oliver Hartley, commercial director of Everty, a provider of electric vehicle chargers; Sam Elsom, who established Sea Forest Australia; Doug McNamee, founder of JOLT, a provider of electric vehicle charges; and Nigel Howard, who established the company Edge consulting, which helps ASX 200 companies decarbonise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work is not finished. This legislation is just the first step and will need amendments and refinements over the coming years. But I say to all the members of parliament, as former President Barack Obama said—and we have heard it before in this chamber—we are the first generation to feel the effect of climate change and the last generation who can do something about it. We need to look back on our time here and see that it was more than just time wasted. What will you tell your loved ones you did when the climate crisis began to dawn on us? Let's use this legislation as a launching pad for more action. I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  This is a big day. In this job we stand up here to speak a lot. Most of the time you feel or, at least, hope that what you are saying is being heard and that it matters—not all of the time, but most. On Monday, I spoke about what a privilege it is to be able to represent the people of Cooper in this House. I said that, when your term comes to an end, and also at the end of your life, you want to look back and say that you spent your time here with pride, that you made a difference, that you made a genuine, meaningful contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, being part of the government legislating the climate change bills feels like a moment I will remember. The Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022 are the circuit-breaker pieces of legislation which will kickstart our government's actions in tackling the climate emergency. These bills legislate Australia's emissions targets: a 43 per cent reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleagues, the minister and the Prime Minister have said, these targets are a floor; they are not a ceiling. They set the floor of our ambition in stone. For so long, when I've spoken to the experts, scientists, economists and researchers about what is holding Australia back from the rapid transition we've seen overseas, they've told me it's about providing certainty and sending a clear message to industry, to investors, to the public and to the world that we have a government that is serious about climate action, has genuine ambition and will put in place the policy settings necessary to enable such a transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we carry out this work, we won't be engaging in policy on the run or policy by thought bubble like the previous government. We will be informed by the experts. The legislation will bring them back to the table by requiring independent expert advice from the Climate Change Authority when it comes to future emissions reductions targets and the actions we take to reach them. This advice will be public, and the minister will be obliged to both formally respond to it and take it into account in decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been sorely missing over the last decade. We saw a deliberate hollowing out of expertise from our Public Service under successive coalition governments. They chose to bury the evidence, ignore the experts and turn their backs not only on the dangers of climate change and the emissions that were happening on their watch but also on the opportunities that come from good climate action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is committed to returning transparency and accountability to this area. By requiring the minister to make an annual statement to parliament on the progress the government is making on climate change, governments can no longer avoid scrutiny. They will be directly accountable to the parliament and to the people and will have to explain the results of their actions with reference to independent expert advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures, contained in the Climate Change Bill, lay the foundations—rock-solid foundations—for Australia's climate action in the years and decades to come. They enable action and they bring certainty. They commit our government to emissions reductions and hold us accountable for getting the work done. There have been conversations in the media as to whether it's necessary to legislate, but what I say in response to that is: 'We want to get this right. We want to be beyond reproach and completely transparent, laying our cards on the table and committing future governments to doing the same.' This bill achieves that, and I'm incredibly proud to speak in support of it today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second bill, the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill starts the work of rolling out climate action across the whole of government. We know that, in order to do the real work of tackling emissions and addressing the climate emergency, we cannot look at industries, sectors and emitters in silos. We need to take the whole economy into account with a whole-of-government approach, embedding climate action and our climate targets in everything we do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As assistant minister in the Health and Aged Care portfolio, I know this includes our health system. I was a founding member of CAHA, the Climate and Health Alliance, and have campaigned not only to reduce the emissions and waste from our health system for years but also to raise awareness of the serious health impacts of climate change. So I'm pleased to be an assistant minister in a government committed to making climate change a national health priority and to developing Australia's first national framework on climate change and health.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill ensures we embed similar action in a number of other Commonwealth agencies and schemes. This includes the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, two agencies we fought tooth and nail to defend against years of coalition attacks. It just makes sense that these agencies should have the emissions reduction targets at the core of what they do. It's madness that it's taken up until now to make it happen. This bill will insert the targets into the work of Export Finance Australia, Infrastructure Australia and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Importantly, it inserts work towards the Paris Agreement into the functions of the CSIRO, the Climate Change Authority and our climate laws.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government turned their backs on their obligations under the Paris Agreement. Under their complete lack of leadership, Australia was put squarely in the naughty corner by the rest of the world. We've all seen the reactions of world leaders to our Prime Minister since the election. Simply put, they are relieved. And what this legislation says to the world is that Australia now has a government that takes climate change seriously, that knows the important role Australia has to play in climate action, and that we now have a government that's taking action that all Australians can be proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The swift action from the minister and Prime Minister in updating our nationally determined contribution to the United Nations sent a strong message in our first days of government. This bill, which we're hoping to pass through parliament prior to the next Conference of the Parties meeting in November, will be the next clear signal to the world that the grown-ups are back. I call on every member of this parliament to work with us to make sure that happens.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you believe in climate action, you should vote for these bills. If you believe in ending the climate wars, you should vote for these bills. If you want Australia to return as a global leader in climate action, you should vote for these bills. I don't think I'm alone—in fact, I know that my electorate and communities around the country are behind me—when I say that I want the division in this place and beyond to end when it comes to climate action. We need to start coming together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to commend the minister for his work in bringing people together on climate action. This is no small task, but, through careful consultation, he has done an incredible job, bringing unions, environmental groups, business groups and hopefully our crossbench groups together to come behind these bills. He has done the legwork out in the community to put an end to the climate wars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd advise all members from across the political spectrum in this place to pause and reflect on the amazing amount of work that has been done in this place and on the opportunity we are presented with by this legislation. As I've said, it sets out very firm foundations from which we can leap, from which our government's climate action can move beyond. These bills deserve the parliament's support and I hope to see them pass with multipartisan support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In passing these bills, we can confidently get moving on the massive task ahead. We find ourselves in an incredibly transformative period, particularly now that our country has a government with the will to tackle climate change head on and to grasp the opportunity that climate action brings with it. By sending signals to Australia and investors that our government will back in renewables, will back in future technologies, will back in low-emissions technologies, we know we will be spurring investments in new projects. And that, of course, means jobs—new jobs, more jobs, good jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know Labor's Powering Australia plan, which we took to the election—the most comprehensive climate policy of any party—will deliver 604,000 jobs. It's a huge and wonderful undertaking. Powering Australia means massive investment in renewable energy generation, in transmission and in projects that will reduce emissions from the industries that today contribute significantly. It will empower individuals and families to adopt the low-emissions technologies of the future, like electric vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government failed Australians by turning their back on these opportunities, through their refusal to act and, for some of their members, their refusal to even acknowledge climate change is real. They scared off investment, they squandered opportunities—opportunities for the massive job creation we will see from Powering Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to companies who will deliver this technology. It's projects like the Star of the South, which was put on hold while the previous minister let the approvals collect dust on their desk. That's a project that is anticipated to deliver 2,000 jobs and around 20 per cent of the energy needed to power the entire state of Victoria. And for pure political reasons, in order to continue stoking the tensions of the climate wars, the previous minister did nothing to get that project moving or to deliver those jobs for workers in Gippsland and across Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also spoken to companies with solar farms that would have loved to expand, but they were already producing more power than the grid could handle. That is absurd. These projects were ready to go; they had the investment ready, they had done the work and they had jobs lined up for communities. Yet the inaction of the former government squandered them. Today is a step forward for those jobs—jobs for the communities that have powered Australia for so long, the communities that have the most to gain from the climate action we desperately need to take.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding I'd like to reflect on the campaigners who have worked so hard over the decades to get us here. I have said many times, both personally and in this place, that the activists in my electorate provide a mountain of advice, expertise and strength to me in pushing for greater climate action. I cannot thank you enough. You all know who you are—from the members of my Climate and Environment Reference Group to the Darebin Climate Action Now people, the Tomorrow Movement activists, the school strikers, the Parents for Climate Action, our forest activists and our creek groups, and the list goes on. If I name individuals, I know I will forget someone and I will never forgive myself. Thank you. The level of expertise and passion in my electorate for climate action I think is almost second to none. These bills and our party's strong commitment are a credit to each and every one of you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know we are living in a climate emergency. I know how urgent it is that we take action, and so does this government. I've told you since I was elected that I would stand up for real change. Well, I stand here today as a member of the government supporting these climate bills that will begin to deliver that change. I have to tell you that I'm just a little bit proud. I can't wait to continue the work alongside all of you back home.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="300124" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I rise today to speak to the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022 on behalf of the people of the federal seat of North Sydney. Let's be clear, these bills do the following: they enshrine in legislation Australia's commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and 43 per cent by 2030 as Australia's nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement and they also provide for an annual statement to the parliament on progress towards achieving those targets. In preparing this statement the minister is required to consider advice provided by the Climate Change Authority and may take advice from other sources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the election result of last May told us anything, it was that the people want faster action on climate change. It has been incredibly heartening to see the new government prioritise the development of this legislation. Having consulted with the North Sydney community, I believe these bills are an important symbolic first step in what will be an exciting time of transformation for our country. As a constituent in Crows Nest said to me, it is heartening for climate change to be acknowledged and accepted instead of being ignored and avoided. But, to be clear, as a community we continue to want faster action on climate change led by facts, not politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the critical decade for climate action and the decisions made in the next three years will fundamentally affect our children's and their children's future. We need a clear and actionable plan to reduce national emissions, guided by experts, to achieve at least 60 per cent by 2030. As an electorate with one of the highest concentrations of rooftop solar in the country, North Sydney is uniquely placed to both benefit from and inspire others to achieve a faster transition to 100 per cent renewable and sustainable energy. As a community we are already pushing for active collaboration between local councils and the state government to make the federal seat of North Sydney one of the first net zero urban energy zones in Australia as we transition to a fully electrified community as quickly as possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">North Sydney will also fight to protect and enhance our green corridors, as these are fundamental to the nature of our community. We will do this by ensuring any infrastructure projects undertaken in our electorate provide solutions for the next century. Climate change and biodiversity loss are closely interconnected and share common drivers through human activities. Both have predominantly negative impacts on human wellbeing and quality of life. We must address both issues with urgency and recognise that impacts happen simultaneously and that projects must therefore be reviewed in light of their cumulative impact. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past week I've consulted with the North Sydney community on these bills. I have heard from households, health professionals, small businesses, company directors, parents and emergency service volunteers. On balance over 96 per cent of my constituents who have engaged in that conversation think we should support this legislation to get things started. To quote my constituents: 'This seems like a good start and a base for further improvements in the future,' or, 'We need to aim higher, but this legislation is a fundamental first step.' One of my favourites was: 'It is the best we have had for years. It gives me hope.' I have heard this message loud and clear from North Sydney, to not miss the current opportunity to move forward, but I've also heard the message that we must keep the pressure on to develop policies and a comprehensive plan to exceed the 43 per cent target. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the space of the past few weeks, we've seen the minister work constructively and in good faith with members of the crossbench to improve these bills, and what we will hopefully see pass in this place this week is a springboard for greater action and greater ambition to meet the size of the challenge ahead of us. I entered conversations with the minister informed by principles of recognising the importance of scientific targets and ensuring that the current emissions reduction target of 43 per cent is a floor, not a ceiling. I was guided by the principle that we must be able to ratchet up ambition in a sustainable way so that we meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement to pursue a limit on warming of 1.5 degrees. I was also driven by the principles of doing politics differently and taking politics out of climate policy. I advocated for a multipartisan approach—for example, through the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee which reflected the new balance of power across the parliament, and for increased integrity and independence for the Climate Change Authority. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The initial draft that was shared with me as a member of the crossbench some weeks ago relied heavily on putting parliamentary and public trust in the climate change minister to do the right thing. The truth is that, while that's admirable, it's not good enough when it comes to legislating positive change, so I've worked with members of the crossbench and the minister to increase the role of parliament—all members of parliament—to increase transparency and to enable greater insight into what advice is being received from where and when. The amendments that I fought for will help ensure parliamentary responsibility and accountability over the minister's response to scientific advice that comes forward from the Climate Change Authority. This is how we will keep climate policy on track, regardless of which of the major parties may be in government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There remain several aspects of the bill and the government's broader climate policies which still urgently require action, which I'd like to briefly outline. Whilst the bill is an important symbolic first step, climate action must be enhanced by grounding longer-term carbon emissions reduction targets in science based principles. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned countries that the current 2030 targets will ensure we hit 3.2 degrees Celsius of warming this century. This will devastate our economy and our environment, which are already reeling from the impact of fires and floods. Australia, thanks to the action taken by the states and despite the laggards in the last parliament, is currently already on track for a 37 to 42 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. I do not want to see this government and this parliament rely on that progress as an excuse to do nothing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that to align with the science and Australia's commitment to the Paris Agreement the government must meet the long-term target of net zero by 2050 and urgently present a whole-of-government plan to decarbonise the Australian economy. A whole-of-government plan must include a national adaptation plan and a response to a national climate change risk assessment; the phasing out of subsidies for coal and gas, with no new coal and gas extraction projects; and the ruling out of biomass energy from burning native forest wood products as renewable energy. We must see detailed sector-by-sector emissions reduction plans for all sectors of the Australian economy, not just those covered by the government's pre-election policies of electricity, industry and carbon farming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must have a plan for reducing transport emissions, which have been increasing up until recently. Australian cars currently run on some of the dirtiest and most emissions-intensive fuels in the world. Dirty fuel is particularly problematic for our North Sydney community, with some of the highest levels of traffic passing through our electorate every day. I will push this government to deliver legislated vehicle and fuel efficiency standards in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must also address various fossil fuel legacies left behind by the previous government, including the composition of the Climate Change Authority board, to ensure that it can provide independent scientific advice and not be held hostage to the interests of the fossil fuel lobby. While the floor of 43 per cent could definitely have been more ambitious, I believe that rather than focusing on what this bill is not we should see it for what it is: an important signal to both our domestic and our international markets on the direction we are headed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with the government on this legislation, an outcome which would not have been possible if I had not been elected as the Independent for North Sydney. We have a long way to go. I will continue to advocate for the changes the people of North Sydney want to see, including pursuing cleaner petrol and stronger fuel efficiency standards for Australian vehicles. But at least the conversation and positive change is underway. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  This bill delivers on our election commitment to Australians to restore national leadership on climate change. The Climate Change Bill 2022 is long overdue. It's an opportunity for parliament to end the climate wars and affirm a national commitment to net zero emission targets. I thank the Minister for Climate Change and Energy for introducing this significant legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians voted at the election to end a decade of denial and delay on climate change. In my electorate of Corangamite—which includes the Great Ocean Road, the Bellarine and parts of Geelong—people were fed up with government inaction on climate change, the most significant threat of our time. They were frustrated by a government which had 22 attempts at an energy plan but failed to land any of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People across our nation are concerned about the state of the environment their children will inherit. They worry about the changing weather patterns and environmental damage they see in their communities across the nation and the globe. A vacuum of political leadership federally has led to crippling uncertainty around investment by business and industry in energy transformation projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians understand there isn't a day to lose in tackling climate change. Yet under the previous government Australia lost a whole decade. That's why it's crucial that we act decisively right now. It's crucial to ensuring confidence and producing certainty for industry, for investors and the wider community. Only confidence and unity of purpose will drive multipronged energy transformation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our target is to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent on 2005 by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. It's backed by business associations, unions and environmental groups who've come together to support the government's emission targets. This commitment brings Australia into line with other nations, including France, Denmark and Spain, that have legislated net zero by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 43 per cent target by 2030 is ambitious, but with the government's Powering Australia plan, it is very achievable. The 43 per cent is a floor, not a ceiling, on Australia's emission reduction aspirations. And it has been arrived at carefully, based on extensive modelling and the science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill sets out a plan for industry, states and territories and the Australian people to work together to reduce emissions in the coming decade and beyond. The comprehensive Powering Australia plan is central. It will deliver 604,000 jobs across the nation and bring renewables to 82 per cent by 2030. It's part of the government's plan to make more things here in Australia. Reducing emissions and making more things here need not be mutually exclusive; we can do both. The Powering Australia plan recognises that our electricity grid is outdated and needs to be fixed. If it's to handle the move to renewables, the grid must have capacity for both large and small volume renewable energy to be fed to many locations and to be moved around the nation to where it's most needed. Manufacturing regions, like mine in the Geelong region, will have the opportunity to contribute to the grid upgrade and to other aspects of Powering Australia, creating new jobs—local jobs—and new business opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The wider Geelong region, which includes much of my electorate, has an enviable manufacturing history; great researchers; innovative, forward-thinking businesspeople; and a willingness to be at the front of innovation. I'm encouraged by the enthusiasm which businesses and local councils in my electorate already have. They are looking for ways to reduce emissions as part of their day-to-day operations. All they needed was a government willing to provide a plan, giving them the certainty and confidence to invest. Australia has the highest uptake in the world of home solar, but just one in 60 households have battery storage, because the upfront costs are still too high. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government plans to fix that for up to 100,000 Australian households by installing 400 community batteries across the country. Community batteries offer great economies of scale, better than household batteries, with lower capital, installation and maintenance costs. They also store and distribute electricity more efficiently by allowing excess solar power to be shared with households unable to install solar. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Climate Change and Energy announced one such community battery will be installed to service the community of the Sands Estate in Torquay in my electorate. That community has extensively researched and understood the multiple environmental and financial benefits of having a community battery. Many other communities across the nation will similarly benefit from this program over time. The government is committed to allocating up to $3 billion from the National Reconstruction Fund to invest in green metals such as steel, alumina and aluminium; clean energy component manufacturing; hydrogen electrolysers; and similar manufacturing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that my electorate of Corangamite and the adjacent electorate of Corio are positioning to play a role in some of these opportunities. I recently brought together business, manufacturing, research and government leaders in my electorate to discuss the possibilities within the National Reconstruction Fund—organisations like the Geelong Manufacturing Council; G21, the Geelong Regional Alliance; the Committee for Geelong; Deakin University; and Regional Development Victoria. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is committed to reducing transport emissions. It's making electric vehicles more affordable, so that families who want them can afford them and help reduce emissions. The government has moved to introduce a fringe benefit tax exemption to apply to non-luxury battery electric cars, hydrogen fuel cell electric cars and plug-in hybrid electric cars. Moving to cleaner fuel transportation is important. In Australia, transport makes up around 18 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions. Just 1.5 per cent of cars sold here are electric or plug-in hybrid, compared to 17 per cent in the UK and 85 per cent in Norway. In total, there are only around 24,000 registered electric cars on Australian roads, of around 15 million total cars. The government will also work with industry, unions, states and consumers to develop Australia's first national electric vehicle strategy. This will encourage Australian manufacturing of electric car components like batteries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also sets clear objectives and functions for a range of government agencies. It'll ensure the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency are fully focused on contributing to Australia's emissions targets. It will require that targets be taken into account by Export Finance Australia and Infrastructure Australia and it recognises the CSIRO's contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency is at the heart of everything this government does, including climate change. The minister for climate change will report annually to parliament on the progress towards meeting our emissions targets. The government will also restore the role of the Climate Change Authority to provide independent advice to the minister and to help inform public debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of everything in this bill comes into sharp focus when we see the real impacts of climate change. Internationally we've seen raging wildfires in North America and record heatwaves across Europe. Unusual weather events are becoming common within Australia. People in Queensland and New South Wales have been subjected to multiple devastating record-level floods. Homes are destroyed, crops swept away and lives taken. Fires have ravaged eastern Australian states over recent years, more devastating than ever. People of the Torres Strait are battling to stop their island homes from disappearing under rising sea levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most significant indicator of all that has happened recently is the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report. This review, completed by scientists last year but held back by the Morrison government until after the election, shows some devastating impacts on the environment. It has found abrupt changes in some Australian ecosystems over the past five years. The health of Australia's environment is poor and has deteriorated over the past five years due to, in large part, the pressures of climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, coastal communities are seeing the impact of rising sea levels on coastal erosion. Flood-prone uninsurable areas on maps are creeping further inland. The people in my electorate are passionate and motivated about addressing climate change. I meet often with these groups, who do wonderful, practical things to raise awareness and reduce emissions at a community level. They are surfers, they are mothers of young children, they are university academics, they are tradies. They care. These people care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My own climate change challenge among local schools is a project that is now in its second year. The challenge encourages teachers, students and members of their families to take action in their school and at home, to assess and find practical ways to reduce the carbon footprint of their daily lifestyle. People want to play their part and make a difference. So too does the Albanese government. Together we can achieve real change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place, we deal with legislation on many important issues. However, there is no more important issue than addressing climate change. This bill resets Australia's ambitions, our approach and our commitments on reducing emissions to tackle climate change. That's what the people of Australia voted for at the election, and it is what we must vote for in this place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  Let me begin by saying that I am so pleased that the first piece of legislation I will be debating is the Climate Change Bill 2022. This is an issue which is vitally important to me and to the people of Wentworth. Climate change matters to Wentworth. We care about it because of the impact that it has around the world and in Australia. Who can forget the devastating images of people wading into the ocean as their homes burned or climbing onto their roofs as rivers swallowed their houses?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But climate change also affects Wentworth. We already see it. We saw it in the east coast lows in 2016, when millions of dollars of damage was done to our coastal infrastructure. We saw it again this year, when our iconic beaches were again inundated by enormous waves. Extreme weather events will only get more prevalent under climate change, and Australia is the OECD country most vulnerable to it. We know that we will see much more of that in the future. Our community will be hotter and drier, with the number of days over 30 degrees doubling by 2050. And we'll see the other impacts that it will have across our community and our world. That is the future for Wentworth, for Australia and for all of us unless we decide to act today and join in collective action across the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a responsibility to recognise what our actions are doing to harm ourselves, others and most importantly—and I say this, seeing the students up there above in the gallery—to future generations. This is why I'm supporting this bill. It is because of you guys sitting up there. We have an opportunity. Acting responsibly on climate isn't just about bearing a financial burden. It's about realising the financial opportunity that comes from changing how we act and how our economy operates and from embracing innovation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is, once again, truly the lucky country. Australia is one of the sunniest and windiest places on earth. A solar panel here creates two to three times more electricity than it does in Europe or Japan. We have lithium, uranium, nickel and many other vital minerals and resources that are vital for a decarbonised future. Australia is facing tremendous opportunity, one unlike any other and one that we must embrace. I'm pleased to say that Wentworth businesses are already starting to embrace this, like MicroTau, who's founder lives in Wentworth, who has created contact film that goes across planes and on ships to reduce drag, reduce fuel consumption and reduce emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's come to the core of this bill. The core of this bill is that it sets out a target for Australia to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and formalises the government's and the parliament's commitment to acting on climate change. This commitment is welcome and is long overdue. The previous target of 26 to 28 per cent by 2030 was manifestly inadequate, and as an aspirational target it was completely ineffective in dealing with climate change and ineffective in providing certainty or a framework for business investment in decarbonisation. That's absolutely crucial, and that's crucial to Wentworth. Businesses will be at the forefront of this change, but they need to believe that the parliament and the people are behind those changes in order to make millions and billions of dollars worth of investment, and I believe that this bill provides that. It was also ineffective, as the election demonstrated so clearly, in effectively delivering on the community's expectation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community's expectations have been clear for years, at least since the 2007 election, when both parties promised action on climate change. But most of the last 15 years have been squandered, with responsibility for action left to state governments and local communities, who have embraced the potential of renewable energy. The enthusiasm and action of local communities has been truly inspiring—and in Wentworth, absolutely, too—but Australia could have gone so much further and so much faster with federal leadership. Instead we have wasted years and literally billions of dollars due to inaction. So I welcome this government's commitment to action, but I want to be clear: this bill does not go far enough. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does four main things. It sets a 43 per cent reduction target by 2030 and net zero by 2050, it requires the minister to table an annual climate change statement, it requires the Climate Change Authority to provide the minister with advice and it requires independent reviews of the act. I don't have any objection to the bill in principle, but I wish the government had gone further. In particular I believe that the target is inadequate. A 43 per cent reduction is simply not sufficient. It is not supported by climate scientists, who state that the world needs at least 50 per cent reduction by 2030 to have a strong chance to keep warming below two per cent and ideally 1.5; it is not supported by business groups, such as the Business Council of Australia, who have identified that Australian businesses can thrive under more ambition—Australian businesses can thrive under a 46 to 50 per cent reduction by 2030; and it is not supported by the community, certainly not the community of Wentworth. A 43 per cent reduction is a political compromise when we need political courage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has acted in good faith in negotiations on this bill. I commend the government for that, and I will take them on good faith that the 43 per cent target is a floor to our collective ambition. The target is not enough, but what is most crucial is the policy and action underpinning the target to ensure that we exceed the target, that we deliver at least 50 per cent reduction by 2030. That work will come. I intend to be part of that work, to be a constructive voice that will at times push the government to go further and go harder than they might otherwise go—to provide that political courage. I will work constructively with the government on risk assessments and mitigation strategies. We can't continue to spend 97c in every dollar of disaster relief focused on cleaning up the mess and only three per cent on the vital actions that are required for mitigation and adaptation. I will work with the government on transport emissions. We have the opportunity to bring in fuel efficiency standards that will not cost the public purse at a time when we have so much debt but will unlock low-carbon and electric vehicle choices for Australians. I will be a voice that draws on my experience, the experience of my constituents, the passion of my constituents and the experience of many experts around the country to ensure we are implementing policies that stimulate innovation and investment, that support our economy and that deliver the change we need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two other changes that I would like the government and the House to consider. The bill as drafted would require the minister to make annual statements to the Australian parliament about Australia's progress in reducing emissions, relevant international developments, the government's climate change policies and the effectiveness of the government's climate change policies. My first change would require that the statement consider the sectoral impact of policies. It is important that Australians and Australian businesses can see what progress is being made by each sector of the community and that each sector of the community understands what its responsibilities are. I hope that this will be the foundation for the government to develop these sector-specific plans, setting out targets and measures that would provide certainty for business, investors and other stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second change would require the statement to consider the effectiveness of government policies in general, rather than just climate policy specifically. This is a subtle change but an important one. It will allow the minister, with advice from the Climate Change Authority, to consider the impact of government policies which might be making emission reduction targets more difficult, such as subsidies for fossil fuel industries. Transparency is vital in this parliament and this transparency will help inform the public debate and allow voters to take an informed view of the full cost of the government policies in relation to climate action. I believe these changes are reasonable and sensible and will help us make progress towards our emission reductions. I hope the government and others in this place will seriously consider supporting them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to talk about the consultation process for this bill and thank the minister and the rest of the crossbench for their engagement. Again, I think of the students up here watching us. I think that they are looking for a parliament that comes together and collaborates on one of the most important issues of the day, so I am really pleased and delighted that this is an example where the government has acted in good faith and worked effectively across the parliament. Through this collaboration, we have the acknowledgement in the bill that the target is a floor, not a ceiling, for our action. We have linked the bill back to the science of climate change, which is absolutely crucial. We have strengthened the accountability that the minister must show parliament and we have ensured this bill will be reviewed periodically. I hope we will see much more of that collaboration in this 47th Parliament and set a high bar for this country and for future parliaments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I will be supporting this bill. It is an important first step, the first real step in far too long, but it is not enough. We need more action. We need risk mitigation strategies. We need adaptation plans. We need greater action on electric vehicles. We need to stop putting public money into fossil fuel subsidies and thoughtlessly expanding the number of gas and coal mines without paying heed to the impact on the world. We need to move to the future, not to the past, and bring our communities with us, all those communities around Australia, however they are impacted by this bill. We need strong accountability mechanisms to ensure the government is adopting the right policies and to ensure those policies are comprehensive and effective and are accountable to the people of this parliament and to the people of this country. I, for one, will be holding the government to account and ensuring that they take the next step and the one after until our country is finally in the place it needs to be.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  I can't tell you how good it feels to be in this chamber today speaking on the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. After my time in the previous parliament, when time after time I had to come into this chamber and point out how the Morrison government was failing us all on climate change, and after sharing my electorate's frustration at a decade of not just inertia but outright obstruction to climate action from a Liberal-National government more interested in running a culture war than protecting our future, it feels so good to be in here talking about legislation that puts in place the framework for the transformation we have to make for all of our futures—to get a renewable future and the jobs, the industries and the clean energy that will come from that, and, of course, the liveable planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a really big task, and we don't have much time to do it, but I am confident that we will do it. The minister has been very clear, in his speech here and in his public statements, that we will work constructively with those here in the parliament and elsewhere who want to help us do that. It has been important to hear from so many members today about how they are willing to work constructively with the Albanese government to get on and do this work. I know there are people who say that 43 per cent isn't enough and I do hear that argument; it's not falling on deaf ears. If we can achieve more, that will be really good, and it is important to recognise 43 per cent is a floor, not a ceiling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can't do any of this if we don't actually start the work. If we keep quibbling, if we keep arguing and if we keep delaying, we won't start the work. We know that business wants to get cracking and we know that state governments already have. What has been standing in their way has been federal government obstruction from the previous government. In fact, we've got groups like the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Energy Council, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Institute of Company Directors—quite a diverse group of interests—all coming together to recognise and say that the lack of a settled policy is what is hurting Australia at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to get this framework in place, and we have to start the work. We can't continue to delay. On that note, I would really urge those opposite to consider their role in providing a settled framework for Australia. Don't get distracted by starting a new culture war around nuclear. The work's been done. Some of your own members did the work in an inquiry two years ago. It's a distraction. Let's get on with it. Let's get on with the renewable future that could be there for all of us. That opportunity is what's in front of us; don't let that pass you by.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will be really important in transforming our country. When I reflect on what I hear in my community and that frustration that I mentioned earlier that so many people feel after a decade of inaction, I know that this legislation will show people that it's Labor governments that do the big reforms. We did it with Medicare, we did it with the NDIS and now we will do it with climate action and make sure that this country is powered by renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this legislation today, we are demonstrating that climate is one of our biggest priorities. As the minister has said, tackling climate change is going to make an enormous economic contribution to our country. This is going to be a transformation that brings us new industries and brings us jobs—also in the areas that have traditionally been reliant on fossil fuel production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia should absolutely be at the forefront of the transformation to renewable energy—that's the opportunity that's in front of us—not only to ensure that we're doing our part to tackle the crisis that the whole world faces but to make the most of the new and emerging industries that will guarantee good, secure jobs for people now and into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the reasons why, as a government, we have worked so hard to get the support of the Australian people and to get ourselves into government so that we can make these changes and put tackling climate change at the top of the agenda. I know for me, personally—and I have said this to my electorate so many times—it is one of the main reasons I am in this place, to make sure that we get on with this work and this huge transformation that we have to make for all of our futures. We are running out of time—for us, for our country and for our planet. We must act on climate and that is what our government is doing. It won't be easy, but we are getting on with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The framework that sits behind a lot of this is our Powering Australia plan, which we took to the election, backed by extensive independent modelling and really well detailed and well-thought-through policy that sets out how we are going to support this transition to renewable energy by investing in the transmission and storage needed to balance the electricity grid, leading to lower electricity prices and, as I said, new jobs—604,000 jobs, in fact, is what our modelling for that plan shows—and new industries and spurring $76 billion worth of investment across our country. Again, I know that in my community many people are looking forward to the opportunities it will bring in terms of the skills they may be trained in, new job opportunities and new ways for them to lead their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will see parts of this plan rolled out in our communities. We've made a commitment to delivering community batteries and solar banks right across Australia, including one in the Belfield area in my electorate, and I very much hope that the Belfield battery will be just the start of my community and others making that switch to storage. I know there are many groups across Jagajaga who have been doing some work on the feasibility of having their own batteries. I commend them for that work. Keep talking to me about that. I'll keep advocating for us to get more batteries in Jagajaga.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also supporting $3 billion of investment in renewables in manufacturing and low-emissions technologies through our government's National Reconstruction Fund, training new energy apprentices in new jobs. I know that my TAFEs in Heidelberg and Greensborough will be looking at the opportunity to expand the skills offering that they provide in that space. And then there is accelerating the uptake of electric vehicles. I am sure I am not the only member in this place who has many members of their community come to them and ask, 'Why are electric vehicles so expensive and what's the government going to do about it?' Well, rest assured, we are going to do something about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been heartbreaking to watch this past decade of missed opportunities on climate. Every failure to act has cost us valuable time, and we don't have much left. So I sincerely hope that, after all this inaction, this is a parliament that gets on with it; that sets the framework; that makes sure that we are on the right path to the renewable energy future that we should all have; that does the work parliament should do, where we look at what we're providing not just for our generation but for the generations to come. This can't just be about what works for us in the here and now. It has to work for those who are to come. The climate wars have to come to an end. It is time for us to work together, to listen to what the country have told us—that they want us to work together, that they want us to get on with this—and to take climate action, to switch to renewable energy. What better way for members in this place to demonstrate that we are all ready to do that than to support the bill that is before us today to get on with the work?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this bill, our Labor government is making it clear that climate change is one of our biggest priorities. We will not let the chance to tackle climate change slip by. We will not let the chance to create the jobs and the industries of the future slip by. We will feel the responsibility we have to this generation and future generations to act on climate change. We are showing that from the very start of this 47th Parliament we will close the door on the past decade of inaction. I sincerely hope the climate wars have ended, because we need our country to work together to fully embrace action on climate change and fully embrace the transformation in our economy that will come with it. It's on that basis that I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  by leave—This is Labor adopting a Greens policy. By reducing Export Finance Australia's flexibility, the Climate Change Bill 2022 puts our national security objectives in the Pacific at risk. Do you think other Pacific powers have hamstrung themselves in this same way? No—not a chance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill could also force Infrastructure Australia to prioritise less-emissions-intensive public transport projects in urban areas over major road projects in regional areas or new ports or airports. The experience in the United Kingdom has seen activists delay the construction of Britain's new high-speed rail network, HS2. The experience in the UK has seen activists challenge the UK government's plan to invest in road maintenance and the construction of new roads because this could lead to increased traffic and thus greater emissions. The experience in the UK has seen activists successfully delay the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport, delaying that construction for years. That case had to go all the way to the UK's equivalent of our High Court before it was finally thrown out. These are the consequences of legislating targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House could also restrict the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, the NAIF, from supporting an expansion of our traditional export industries, particularly energy and agriculture. To that, no doubt, the Greens would say, 'Fine,' because they don't like coal and gas anyway. But this legislation will also hamper the development of clean energy industries. Take the example of critical minerals processing. The former coalition government prioritised the development of new critical minerals processing projects as part of the government's $2.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy. But critical minerals processing can be harmful to the environment. It is also energy intensive, and therefore emissions intensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does that mean? If you apply to new minerals projects the same rules Labor and the Greens would like to apply to coal and gas, how could these agencies support projects that increase Australia's emissions? The problem is that they are seeking to legislate something that will hamper not just Australia's competitive advantage but progress with clean energy technologies. If they apply that rule, which they are suggesting they will, then suddenly critical minerals processing comes into question. At a time of heightened volatility and uncertainty in the Indo-Pacific, with rising interest rates and stalling economic recovery under this Labor government, not to mention a global energy crisis, this is absolute madness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister and his climate change minister have been so focused on the politics that they have forgotten to think about the consequences of this legislation. The coalition, for its part, remains absolutely open to sensible policies that reduce power prices and support economic growth while reducing emissions. When we were in government we exceeded our emissions targets, despite not legislating them. When we left office, emissions were lower than ever before, at more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels. We reduced our emissions faster than did many of our peers—Canada, Japan and New Zealand, just to mention a few.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a reminder to the government that has walked away from tackling prices, the coalition also drove prices down. Power prices dropped by eight per cent for households and by between 10 and 12 per cent for businesses, and that was over just the last term of the coalition government, yet the Labor government went to the election promising even lower prices, only to abandon that promise in the first week of the new parliament. The coalition, at the end of the day, will not support legislation that puts our energy and national security at risk or our economy. There are a range of other concerns that the coalition have regarding this legislation and they include its lack of equity and balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, if the bills were equitable they would account for the economic consequences of higher energy prices and their impact on Australian businesses, investments and jobs, along with the households and families and the basic way of life for everyday Australians. But these bills do not account for any of these things. What the government must not forget is that when power prices rise they disproportionately impact those who can afford them least. In other words, if Labor does not accept that economics need to be taken into account with these bills, then surely they must consider the moral consequences of what they wish to implement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policy to achieve the objectives laid out in these bills also requires the construction of new facilities and transmission lines across the country. These will have a direct impact on countless local communities, including in the minister for infrastructure's electorate of Ballarat, yet the bills before the House lack any requirement for the minister to report to the parliament on how the implementation of the government's policies affects these communities. There is no requirement for the government to take into account the effect of implementing these policies on regional communities or even on agricultural land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, if these bills were balanced, they would reflect a technology-agnostic approach that encourages free enterprise and promotes entrepreneurship, research and development. Sadly, however, the Albanese Labor government has abandoned the technology investment roadmap process and the cost reduction targets that the former coalition government put in place. This is what you get from the Albanese-Bandt government in the bills that we see before the House. The new government has also removed any references to reducing the cost of new and emerging technologies from its NDC. Indeed, much of the investments initiated by the former coalition government are now under review. The Labor government has no plan to reduce the cost of deploying new and emerging low-emission technologies. It is not just the balance of technologies that count; it is also the balance of the economic burden that is to be carried. Labor's policy to achieve the objectives laid out in the bill include applying punitive penalties against selected sectors of the economy and, by extension, to their communities and their workers. I'm not just talking here about Labor's proclivity for increases in taxation, as reflected in the changes they plan to make to the safeguard mechanism. Not content with removing safeguards from the bills, Labor has actively removed all safeguards from its updated 2022 NDC. This government and this minister are actively avoiding scrutiny. When you consider all the possible adverse consequences of this bill, it makes you wonder why the government wants to introduce legislation that it has itself called 'unnecessary'. Seeking to reduce emissions, without accounting for the economic impact, the price impact, on businesses and families is foolishness of the highest order, and it represents a derogation of duty on the part of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has initiated a review of its climate and energy policies. Any new emissions reduction targets or policies to achieve them that the coalition takes to the next election will reflect the latest economic developments and emissions projections. They will also account for the role that new and emerging technologies could play in an Australian context. A least-cost approach to reducing emissions means that all technologies must be on the table. That includes carbon capture and also advanced nuclear power technologies, both of which feature in the United States's, the United Kingdom's and the EU's plans to get to net zero emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, Labor have made it very clear that they will not honour the commitment they made to the Australian people just over two months ago. We have already learnt of, in this first sitting of the parliament, their intention to break a promise of reducing power bills by $275. This is the Albanese Labor government's first broken promise. They went to an election with a climate change policy that included two parts: a 43 per cent reduction in emissions and a $275 reduction in power bills. The parliament opens, and they furnish and they table their legislation to enable this climate change policy. But there is no mention of price. There is no mention of that economic consequence, making this legislation effectively a broken promise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that this bill is not about the 2030 target because the 2030 target of 43 per cent has already been set by the new government. The United Nations has been informed. This bill, no matter how people vote on it, will not make one bit, one iota, of difference to the 43 per cent target that has been set by the government. It's completely the prerogative of the Prime Minister and the cabinet to change that target, and they have. So this is not about the target. It's not about the 43 per cent. This is about the legislation, and Labor have caved in to the Greens and, in doing so, is prepared to put communities, projects, jobs and intellectual property staying in Australia at risk. This is what they have at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences of their consequential amendment bill are a scary prospect and one that the government have not thought through. This ultimately is legislation that comes as nothing more than a political stunt. The coalition will always support policies to bring down emissions, but we will not do it where we compromise our economy and our national security.</span>

That really says it all as to why we are here having this debate right now and what the motivations are around this legislation that the government say is not required for them to put in place any of the policies that they took to the election. I certainly look forward to them putting in place and honouring the policies they took to the election in this area, particularly their promise to lower the average household electricity bill by $275 per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to make a few very clear points when it comes to the importance of climate change and emissions reduction in this country and globally. The first is that every serious political force in this country is committed to achieving net zero emissions by the year 2050. Some are saying perhaps before then, but 2050 is within the global frameworks—Paris, of course. The Liberal Party has a policy, which it took to the last election, to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The National Party has that position. The Labor Party, now the government, has that position. The Greens have a position to get to net zero. I won't speak for individual Independents et cetera. But every major political force is committed to that. That is not up for debate in this debate or, frankly, in any of the debates leading towards policy positions around climate change now and towards the next election. That is very clear. It's not about if, but about how—how do we get to net zero emissions in the time frame outlined in a way that is environmentally and economically responsible?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I make is that my side of politics arrived at that position in the last term of the parliament. That was a commitment made as a coalition—as the Liberal Party and the National Party together—to achieve net zero emissions by the year 2050. I was heavily involved within the processes of my party to convince my colleagues and was a part of that process that led to the commitment that Prime Minister Morrison announced and took to the Glasgow COP26 conference in 2021. I'm very proud of the role that I played within my party to achieve that position, because it's one that's important, it's one that I believe in, it's one that my electorate wants to see achieved and it's one that is important for the planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an inherently conservative value to be a conservationist and to care about the environment and this planet that we live on. That is an inherently conservative value. It's one that I hold. The first significant world leader to put the challenges of climate change on the record was Margaret Thatcher. I don't think Margaret Thatcher has any crisis of confidence from anyone as far as her credibility and bona fides of being a genuine conservative go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the 2050 position is clear. It's my own values. It's the values of my electorate. It's the party position of my party, the coalition, and all the significant political forces in this country. That's not what the debate is now. It's about how we are going to progress to achieve that. We on this side of politics, on the Liberal-National side, need make sure that we are taking to the next election a very clear Centre Right policy approach to reducing emissions in our country across the various time lines that are significant in these international agreements. One is 2030, but 2025 under Paris will be upon us very soon. Obviously everyone needs to outline exactly how we're going to achieve that pathway to net zero by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to again, like I did in the last parliament, being a part of achieving a policy position in my party of net zero by 2050 and to again being a part of achieving the significant suite of policies we take to the 2025 election around what approach we will take towards emissions reduction for 2030—what our target will be for 2030; we will have a new position on 2030—2035 and beyond. I very much look forward to being a part of that, because I am committed to ensuring that the Liberal-National Party coalition has a strong Centre Right political set of solutions to the challenges of achieving net zero by 2050 and the milestones along the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of that absolutely must be considering all options, and there is one option which all the major economies around the world who are committing to 2050, and taking aggressive targets in the medium term as well, are considering: all those major economies right across the world have nuclear as part of that approach—the United Kingdom, Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan et cetera. Nuclear is base-load power that is emissions free, and all those nations with aggressive emissions reduction targets have nuclear as part of that solution. How can we possibly say with a straight face that we want to get to net zero emissions in this country by 2050 and equally, at the same time, not say we should look at one of the most significant sources of base-load emissions-free electricity generation? It is absolutely ridiculous to say that we are not going to have a discussion and a proper look at that as a potential part of the mix when it comes to us achieving net zero by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I've followed the nuclear debate in this country and internationally for a long, long time. In South Australia, Jay Weatherill, the Labor Premier of South Australia, called for and established a royal commission into the entirety of the nuclear cycle. He said: 'I want us to look at nuclear. I want us to look at mining more uranium in South Australia. I want to look at moving along the supply chain of uranium. I want to look at further processing of uranium in South Australia. I want to look at generation.' Jay Weatherill, the left-wing Labor Premier of South Australia, wanted to look at generating nuclear energy in South Australia, and he wanted to look at taking the planet's high-level nuclear waste and putting it in a dedicated facility in South Australia. Jay Weatherill, the Labor Left Premier of South Australia, initiated a process and wanted to have a look at that, and that occurred. Rear Admiral Kevin Scarce, the former Governor of South Australia, became the royal commissioner, and they did that body of work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, post that, the process that Weatherill set up, around citizens' juries et cetera, to take the outcome of the royal commission further was a failure because of him and his government, and I don't necessarily support elements of what he was trying to do anyway. But the point is that it is ludicrous for us not to look properly at nuclear. The economics have not stacked up in the past, particularly in this country, and that's because in the past we've never had a debate about the abundant use of fossil fuels like coal for electricity generation. The Latrobe Valley and the Hunter Valley, co-located to the two great metropolises in this nation, Sydney and Melbourne, have abundant coal that can be mined for and generated into electricity onsite, sent down the poles and wires into the businesses and households of this country, particularly in those major centres. But if we're going to get to net zero by 2050, that is not a possibility into the future. That's why nuclear has not stacked up in decades past, and even now it is extremely expensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's fine, because we'll determine that in this debate. We will discover in this debate, when we look at this properly and we understand not just what nuclear's capability is now, from an economic point of view, but what it might be into the future as technology continues to develop, whether or not it is an economically viable solution to the mix of generation into the future. But why is it that those who want to decarbonise this country and the planet can't stomach and won't tolerate the concept of part of the energy to replace energy that generates emissions being emissions-free generated energy? Why is it that they say that can't come from nuclear? Furthermore, if that's the case, why aren't they saying that to their friends in other countries of this planet, particularly in Europe and North America, that are using nuclear and absolutely will be using more nuclear as they proceed to get towards their target of net zero by 2050, or whatever their targets may become or change to in the future?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is just appalling that there are some in this debate who want that but aren't prepared to have that discussion. That needs to be front and centre in this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very disappointed that this has become a political point-scoring exercise instead of a genuine opportunity for the government to be focused on implementing the policies that they took to the last election to achieve the targets that they laid out. This bill doesn't have anything to do with that, and they should be focused on implementing their policies, particularly the cost saving in their policy of $275 a year on household electricity bills.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  Before I remark on some of the ridiculous things that have been mentioned by those opposite, I do want to take a moment to just stop and appreciate that, for the first time in a decade, this place, the people's House of Representatives in Australia, is taking an almighty step forward when it comes to tackling climate change. That is a moment that we are all extremely proud of. I am certainly proud to be a part of a Labor government delivering climate action, as we said we would. What we are seeing is government and Australia exactly as the Australian people asked for—to be collaborative, to work across political divides and to try and get outcomes to benefit the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is going to happen is that we're going to see a number of people, not just in the government but in the crossbench and in the minor parties, support this piece of legislation in this place and in the upper house. This will become an act of law, and I couldn't be prouder of the fact that it took a Labor government to help bring forward significant climate action in this country. I thank each and every member for the way in which they have constructively engaged in the debate on the climate change legislation. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy has done an outstanding job of bringing forward this bill and bringing forward Australia's credible position as a global player to tackle climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While all of that is going on, and while this country takes an almighty leap forward in tackling climate change, in legislating the targets we took to the election and in legislating the policies of transitioning towards renewable energy—and while this parliament takes a proud and direct step forward as part of the international community, together with the Pacific nations, our friends and family and all the communities who have been affected by climate change—there are some in this place who are parking themselves out of the debate, who are dealing themselves out of climate action and who are deciding that they don't want to be a part of the solutions. They are becoming increasingly isolated on that side of the House. They're not going to listen to my political advice, but, as an observer, it is absolutely insane that these people have just watched their friends and colleagues, some of whom are people I admired very much, who were members in the previous parliament—people of integrity and of capability—being completely eliminated from this place, and they have ignored every single lesson that the Australian people have sent them. And I don't say this out of any great sense of winning or anything like that. It doesn't bring me any joy that this is still some sort of ridiculous partisan divide and that the economics and the politics of this are not settled. Those opposite are still dealing themselves out of progress. Australia does not get served by the attitude of dealing yourselves out of climate change. The Australian people get served by this place working collaboratively between government and non-government members to try and get outcomes, and that is what this bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The climate change bill makes some significant legislative changes. The first one is to legislate our emissions reduction targets as part of our nationally determined commitments. We are giving certainty to the private sector, which is saying, 'We want the investment of trillions of dollars into renewable energy and into cheap, clean energy with dispatchable power.' We are saying clearly that we want that in Australia and that there is certainty in the market, and that is what the legislation provides. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also makes a number of amendments to existing funds, like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, which focus government spending on the transition towards a low-emissions future. It is now a part of government focus and government agency that we are moving towards a low-emissions future. That is what this bill enshrines in law. That is what those opposite are voting against. They're voting against the resources and utilities of government that can help to invest and to transition our economy into a cleaner future. And why is this not surprising? It's because the last time they were in government they came into this place and tried to dismantle all of those instruments—</span>

He was an absolute advocate for providing the critical-care doctor for the LifeFlight service, which in government the coalition committed to. I'd like to hope that the Labor Party maintains that commitment, because it is needed. It is quite simply needed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  The last election was about many things, but one of the issues that was absolutely front and centre across the board, across our country, was the environment. We're discussing climate change here today, which is incredibly important, but another aspect of the environment that is very important is the health of our rivers and waterways. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pay tribute today to the many volunteers and community organisations that do so much to protect the parks, wetlands, rivers and waterways of Fraser. I'll single out two, but there are many such organisations throughout my electorate. I'll single out two because I've been with them over the last few weeks in river lands and parkways, protecting our natural environment. The first is the Friends of Kororoit Creek. On National Tree Day they organised a tree planting in which we planted over 2,000 trees at the Bug Rug, a local nature reserve just off Kororoit Creek. I believe that a very small proportion, but hopefully a positive proportion, of the trees that I planted may survive the year and that I'll be able to visit them next year. </span>

They organised a tour recently of this very important environment, showing the importance of local fauna and flora. </span>

After a relentless local grassroots campaign, I was proudly able to deliver $8.7 million to save Moora college. In the same year, I successfully fought alongside local families against Premier McGowan's plans to close the Schools of the Air. Late last year, the Labor government abused their parliamentary majority to decimate regional representation—shameful. It's Labor again demonstrating either that they do not understand regional WA or that they simply don't care. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is no surprise that communities reliant upon the agricultural region in my electorate of Durack are increasingly anxious about the rapid spread of foot-and-mouth disease in Indonesia, given that Labor are now at the helm at the state and federal levels. We on this side understand that you do not get a second crack at this. The export of red meat, livestock, wool and dairy would be lost overnight. WA Labor's agriculture minister, on the other hand, 'would not say it would be catastrophic'. Oh, it would be catastrophic, alright. Only recently were people who were in the UK during the mad cow disease outbreak, some 20 years ago, enabled to give blood. That includes me as well. I will continue to hold the state and federal Labor governments to account to ensure that regional Western Australia, and regional Australia more broadly, has the protection it needs and deserves. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese must stop the planned rollback to transparency and accountability measures for super funds which has been proposed by his government. Through draft regulations released under the cover of a very late Friday media release, the government is proposing to reverse the requirement for super funds to disclose how they spend super members' funds on sponsorship, advertising and payments. The Prime Minister must step in and stop this. The proposed changes go against recommendations by both the Productivity Commission and APRA.</span>

The Prime Minister and his government propose to reverse this requirement, allowing super funds to hide how they spend members' funds via a lump sum of expenditure, with no line items, no accountability and no transparency.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It says a lot about the priorities of the Prime Minister and his government that taking away transparency and accountability from how super funds spend members' money was the very first act of Treasury. The question that must be asked is: What are this government hiding? Why are they removing transparency and accountability so soon after the election? Putting transparency, integrity and decency back into the national debate—that's what the government said. They now have the opportunity, and are on notice, to deliver exactly what they promised.</span>

We have thousands of talented athletes in Pearce able to train and play in local facilities, and swimmers will be able to enjoy Labor's election commitment for the Alkimos Aquatic and Recreation Centre when it is completed.

Being selected to represent your country is a significant achievement in itself, and I'm sure that each and every athlete is extremely proud of their achievements.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  The government has introduced legislation regarding two weeks leave for domestic and family violence. I'd like to lay on the record that I am supportive of the concept, but I am not supportive of the concept that it should be funded by the employer. I think there is a whole lot of red tape around that that will be a great disincentive for employers to take on women and take on anybody they think may be in a domestic violence situation, particularly since the government has, against the recommendation of the Fair Work Commission, decided to extend it to casual employees as well. You can imagine what kind of burden this could be on a small employer—someone who employs one, two, three people—that they are now responsible for up to another 10 days leave a year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea, of course, is that if anybody has to access this leave it should remain private. But I would say that in a small workplace it would be all but impossible to keep it private. The word spreads around. So I think it has the ability to actually have the opposite effect and to be a deterrent to people who want to apply for that particular kind of leave.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the difference between this entitlement and the paid parenting leave, which is clearly delineated as a non- employer expense and is being picked up by the taxpayer? I think this should be the same.</span>

But I also rise to speak about one of the most significant challenges that we have, which is dealing with homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday morning I had the opportunity to meet with Frances Crimmins and Kate Colvin from Homelessness Australia. Frances also does great work leading the YWCA here in Canberra. They told me about their plan to end homelessness, which is a strategy to end rental stress and homelessness for women, children, young people and First Australians and halve the number of people returning to homelessness services. These are worthy and ambitious targets, and I thank Frances and Kate for sharing them with me. Too many Canberrans are impacted by housing insecurity and more needs to be done to assist them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing homelessness and housing insecurity sits at the heart of the ambitions of our new government. Over five years we will build 20,000 social housing properties, with 4,000 of these set aside for women and kids fleeing violence and older women at risk of homelessness. We will also build 10,000 homes for frontline workers to enable them to live much closer to where they work. When these workers cannot live in the communities where they work there is a huge problem. I remain committed to working with people like Kate and Frances in this term of government. </span>

In fact, in my electorate alone one in 10 people are relying on income support to get by. In my conversations with organisations within Brisbane like Communify, 3rd Space, Q Shelter and Open Doors Youth Service the importance of livable income support has always been very clear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, many of these organisations reflected that during the initial stages of the pandemic when the rate of income support was lifted above the poverty line the need for their services dramatically decreased. What this represents is a failing of current government policy. The government has the power to lift 5.5 million people on income support out of poverty, to provide them with a real safety net.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These charitable organisations within Brisbane and around Australia do a fantastic job of providing support to those who need it most. Not only do they help those in poverty to get back on their feet, but they build strong community networks as well. The community of Brisbane knows these organisations have their back and it is time the government does as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  It seems this place has taken no notice of the fact that China has mobilised right along its border with Taiwan. For those who read history books, you're watching mobilisation throughout Europe and you're watching mobilisation now in Asia. If you can't see what's going on, if you can't hear the drums of war beating, then you will suffer the consequences. There has been not only mobilisation but also invasion, of course. If that's not the drums of war beating, I don't know what is. What do you need? According to our two greatest living warriors, the most experienced general and rear admiral in recent Australian memory, you need essential services—fuel, electricity and water. We have three days supply of fuel. In an emergency situation, we have three days supply of fuel. The people in this parliament—you and I—are responsible for this. Secondly, you need electricity. China owns 42 per cent of the Australian electricity industry. If it turns off three power stations, then you are on intermittent power. We don't know who owns the water in Australia, but we do know that the biggest water owner in Australia is the Ord stage 2— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Today I wish to speak about some of Boothby's finest who have recently been honoured as part of the Queen's Birthday honours. Member of the Order of Australia Dr Peter Heysen is a long-term general practitioner in our area. He is also a lecturer and is involved in a number of the local medical groups. Dr Michelle Kiley is director of epilepsy at Royal Adelaide Hospital and she was recognised for her service to neurology and to professional associations. Mr Alan Southcott AM was recognised for significant service to rowing, as a competitor, administrator and coach. Awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia, we have Darren McLachlan, who is a long-term member of the Marion Swimming Club, for services to swimming, and there was Geoffrey Wilson, who is a very well-known painter in our area. He has worked at a number of the local art societies and, most notably, at the South Australian School of Art. In the military awards we have Commodore Steven Tiffen AM, recognised for exceptional service in surface ship acquisition and sustainment for the Australian Defence Force. Commodore Tiffen is a marine engineer. He served for 33 years in the Royal Australian Navy and he is now the director-general of Naval Construction Branch at Osborne, which is a really important naval site in Adelaide, where we have historically built submarines and boats. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I rise to update the House on a great milestone at the Magill Village Project, which I was thrilled to secure $2 million of funding towards—a partnership between the previous coalition government and two local councils, Campbelltown and Burnside. This project is going to be a great outcome for the precinct of Magill Road. There has been some short-term pain for long-term gain for traders along there, and I thank them so much for their patience. We have had to close footpaths as we've worked through the process of kerbing and paving and burying powerlines. That has caused some short-term disruption to the traders, but they are 100 per cent behind this project because the long-term outcome for them is going to be absolutely fantastic. We are now at the stage where all of that work is done, and now in the heart section of the precinct we're about to get to that final exciting stage of laying the top level of asphalt along the road and opening it up completely to the public. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's going to be an excellent outcome for the families in the area and businesses in the area. For those lucky enough to live in Magill and the surrounding areas, it's going to be a lovely place to go get a cup of coffee and spend your leisurely weekends. I really thank everyone at the Campbelltown and Burnside councils for their work on this project. The community is already in love with it. It's only going to be better when it's finished, and I'm thrilled to have been able to secure funding to make it happen.</span>

Probably the most relieved are our workers and residents in aged care. </span>

They're concerned about not having nurses on shift on weekends or about having people who are sick.</span>

You can imagine how frustrated they are when the opposition tries to belittle and demonise and say: 'How many? How many nurses?' A lot of nurses are needed, a lot of extra workers are needed, and these workers are so relieved that they now have a government that is going to work with them on rebuilding their workforce. </span>

With the support of some on the crossbench, Labor has recklessly walked away from communities in Ceduna, the East Kimberley, the Goldfields, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. What the Labor Party has done is unleash a tsunami of alcohol and drugs into vulnerable communities, and we know what the consequence will be. It will be an increase in violence and antisocial behaviour. More domestic violence and more neglected children will be the outcome of what the Labor Party did today, and it's a disgrace. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card is working, and if you don't believe me, listen to some of the stories from these communities. A community paramedic in Ceduna said, 'Since the CDC, we've definitely seen a decline in domestic violence, alcohol consumption and the number of people presenting to the ED.' A community elder in Ceduna said, 'Our people are coming home in boxes due to alcohol and drugs. We go on the CDC to support our people.' A Hope Community Services worker in Kalgoorlie said, 'Kids are no longer going hungry—they are at school with lunches and school uniforms.' Those opposite are unleashing domestic violence and neglect of children, and it's a disgrace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  The former minister for communications, the member for Bradfield, used COVID-19 as an opportunity to abolish Australian children's TV content quotas on commercial broadcasters without introducing any content obligations on streaming services to take their place. Why? Well, perhaps he was keen to keep the commercial stations happy in the hope that he might get some positive media coverage for his ailing government. Maybe—who knows? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thousands of Australian jobs were jeopardised at a time when we were desperately trying to keep people employed. Our kids need to see our Australian stories and hear our Australian voices on TV; it's an important part of how we build our sense of nationhood. An easy and cheap solution would be to put Australian content quotas on the streaming services. This would create jobs funded by international investment. Platforms such as Netflix are raking in billions of dollars per year in Australian subscriptions. Our money, Australian money, is going offshore. Quotas would bring some of that money back and return some of the jobs and opportunities that were lost under this mob. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our screen industry needs a strong Australian content quota, and the Australian children's producers need a subgenre quota of 20 per cent. I think that's fair enough, given our Aussie kids are 21 per cent of the Australian population.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  This week, Australians are cheering on our athletes in green and gold at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, and what a magnificent job they're doing. It's a great honour that from my electorate we have two representatives at the games: Ellen Ryan from Goulburn, competing in the lawn bowls, and Josh Azzopardi from Camden, competing in the men's 4 x 100 track relay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ellen Ryan knows the Goulburn bowling club green like the back of her hand. At 25, she's the youngest member of the Australian lawn bowls team. On Monday she claimed Australia's first-ever gold medal in women's lawn bowls singles at the Commonwealth Games. What an outstanding achievement. She is great ambassador for our nation and for her home town of Goulburn, which is also my hometown. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Josh Azzopardi is also participating in the games. He joined Camden Little Athletics in the under-sixes as a bit of fun with some schoolmates. It was there that he found his stride and a love of athletics. Now, at 22, he's representing his country and his hometown of Camden at the games. What a proud moment for his community, his family and our nation. Josh recorded his best Australian championship performance in April, sprinting his way to a silver medal in the 100 metres. We are all behind him and the team, who are running in the men's 4 x 100 relay taking place later this week. Well done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  Football is more than a game; it's about community, too. To make our community sporting organisations work, we need committed volunteers who have a love of the game and a love of our community. One of these volunteers is Jean Kouriel from the Ashfield Pirates Football Club. He started the club from scratch and spent years building it up to the success that it is today. He did it because of the love of the game and everything that comes with it—friendship, community and fun. Imagine Jean's joy when I was able to announce that a Labor government would commit funds to improve the facilities at their home ground at Hammond Park in Ashfield. A Labor government will give our kids great facilities in local parks, because it's here that a love of the game is developed. </span>

They are the future of the game, and they do us all proud. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We love our sport here in Australia, and rightly so. These sporting moments inspire us, give us hope and bring us together. So I can't wait for the Women's World Cup in Australia next year, to see how many young girls and boys are inspired to take up the game.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  For the first time in two years, Sheepvention took place in Hamilton, after a two-year hiatus. Hamilton was able to showcase everything that's wonderful about sheep, about lambs, about wool—and all the innovation that goes into it. Over 3,000 school students were going to visit over the three days so they could learn about the importance of agriculture and the wealth that it provides into our community and how it sustains our community. But there was also concern from all those who participated in Sheepvention, and I'm glad the Prime Minister is here for this 90-second statement, because FMD is still hanging over the heads of everyone. FMD is still a grave concern right across Western Victoria. The question my constituents have is about the risk rating for the chance of an FMD outbreak, which has gone from nine to 11 per cent. Prime Minister, when will that risk rating start to come down? When will you be able to inform us that that risk rating, which has gone from 9 to 11 per cent, is starting to come down? We need more transparency. We need more accountability on the possibility of an FMD outbreak in Australia.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 30 March 2022, of the Honourable Robert James (Bob) Brown AM, a former Minister and Member of this House for the Division of Hunter from 1980 to 1984, and the Division of Charlton from 1984 to 1998, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Brown's first couple of attempts to get into federal parliament did not meet with success, but, identified by Gough Whitlam as a future great asset to the party, Bob kept going and going. Indeed, some of his weekends of campaigning were bookended by 700-kilometre drives to and from Deniliquin, where he worked as a commerce teacher. The campaigning eventually paid off. By the time he retired, this son of the New South Wales coalfields had served in three levels of government: as mayor and state member for Cessnock and as federal member for Hunter and Charlton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob had what I view as a particularly solid grounding for a political life: a degree in economics from Sydney university. The economics textbooks he wrote were mainstays of the Australian curriculum for decades. According to Bob, when the free market ceases to act in the interests of the people, government has a responsibility to step in. As Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support in the Hawke and Keating governments, Bob oversaw radical reforms such as increased seatbelt wearing and a national blood alcohol limit of 0.05 for drivers. It literally saved a countless number of lives. He improved conditions in the road transport industry, and he sealed the last few metres of the National Highway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob was born in Pelaw Main in the Hunter region of New South Wales. His father carted timber to the coalmines—timber that held up the mine roofs under which his uncles, his cousins and his grandfathers all toiled. Bob was keenly aware of the dangerous work of miners. Recounting his primary school days, he explained: 'When the pit whistle went during the day, the class would freeze, because the pit whistle did not go unless some accident or something similar had happened. The kids would wonder whether it was dad or granddad or Uncle Tom or an older brother who could have been injured or killed.' That was the stark reality of life in the mines then—a truth spelled out on too many headstones in too many cemeteries. What it instilled in Bob was a powerful belief in trade unionism. As he put it on one occasion: 'When workers are united they are invincible. They know struggle and have been strengthened by it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob served Australia throughout his life. He served his community. He did it with intellect, insight and conviction. Now that Bob has joined his beloved wife, Joy, in the realm of memory, our hearts go out to his son, Brad; to his daughter, Kelly Hoare, who succeeded him in this place as the member for Charlton; and to his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. May he rest in peace.</span>

Robert James Brown. Bob was elected to the House of Representatives in 1980, serving as the member for Hunter. In 1984 he ran for and won the newly formed seat of Charlton, and he remained in it until his retirement in 1998. Under Prime Minister Hawke, he was appointed the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support in 1988. A testimony to his work is that he maintained his ministerial responsibilities for land transport under Prime Minister Paul Keating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob grew up in the Hunter as part of a working-class mining family, as the Prime Minister pointed out. A recipient of a scholarship to study at the University of Sydney, he completed a Bachelor of Economics followed by a DipEd. It was during his first teaching placement in Broken Hill that he met Joy, whom he married in 1960. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having unsuccessfully run for the seat of Paterson, Bob was not deterred. He would take the long road to Canberra through local and state politics, and on 2 December 1980 Bob delivered his first speech in this House. Those words continue to provide a window into the man—a man who was honoured to represent the people with whom he had personally associated with for so long. He was a man who stood against our involvement in Vietnam and against tax increases for workers and wanted to make sure that there would be a crackdown on tax evasion by those that sought that path. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a minister, Bob instituted uniform road transport regulations. He improved road safety and improved and certainly championed random breath testing and the mandatory wearing of bicycle helmets. He's been described as an old-style Labor hero and a true believer, and it is obviously the case that he remained true to himself and trusted by his constituents. Such qualities clearly ran in the blood, with Kelly Hoare taking up the baton from her father as the member for Charlton. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob's contributions to the nation were acknowledged with his being made a Member of the Order of Australia. On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Bob's colleagues in the Labor Party, to his community and friends and especially to his children, Kelly and Brad, who only last year lost their mother, Joy. May Bob and Joy both rest in peace. </span>

Before becoming Prime Minister, you repeated your promise to cut electricity bills by $275 on no fewer than 15 occasions. After becoming Prime Minister, you haven't mentioned it once. Prime Minister, you said, 'It's the job of the Prime Minister to deal with the challenges that Australia faces and not to constantly just blame someone else.' So will you be honest with the Australian people and tell them whether they will be getting the $275 cut that you promised them? </span>

Our mandate will see a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. While we're doing it, we'll create 604,000 new jobs, five out of every six of them in regional Australia. Our mandate will see the renewable sector, as part of the national energy market, grow to 82 per cent by 2030—all part of our plan to go to net zero by 2050. And I'm pleased that we have had statements today across this parliament from people who are prepared to not get everything that they want but are prepared to acknowledge the fact that we need to end the climate wars. </span>

That was what was said at that time by the minister, now the shadow Treasurer. In May 2019, the average wholesale price was $93—in 2019.</span>

It was missed by just $271.25! They promised $70 and delivered $341. And now, in their opposition to the cheapest form of energy—renewables—they've come up with the most expensive as the solution: nuclear power. Putting the member for Fairfax in charge of a review on nuclear power bears an uncanny resemblance to Mr Burns putting Homer Simpson in charge of nuclear power safety in Springfield! No-one loves a reactor like a reactionary, so it's no wonder they're so obsessed by nukes over there.</span>

Australians know we're facing the most complex strategic environment that we've encountered as a nation in over 70 years. We live in an area of strategic competition and increased tension. We will work with partners to promote peace and stability in our region, and we've already begun repairing some of the relations in the region. But we do have a capability gap in so many areas. It demands a very frank assessment of our defence capabilities and our pipeline—making sure we can be absolutely confident we are getting it right, that every dollar is going into the right area and that it's money that is well spent. We want to ensure that the ADF is well positioned to meet the nation's security challenges over the decade and beyond.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why today—once again, consistent with the announcement that I made in my speech on the 70th anniversary of ANZUS and consistent with my speech to the Lowy Institute prior to the election—we've announced a holistic consideration of force structure and posture, of force disposition, of preparedness, and of strategy and associated investments. We've appointed the former Minister for Defence and former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Professor Stephen Smith, and the former Chief of the Defence Force, Sir Angus Houston, to be the independent leads on this—a unique blend of knowledge and experience. We want to take stock of the billions of dollars in defence programs, many of which are over budget and are delayed. There are currently 30 major defence projects running a total of 79 years late. We're going to make sure that Defence has the capability and force structure that is fit for purpose, that is affordable and that delivers the greatest return on investment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reviewers will of course work with the Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Campbell, and the secretary of the department, Greg Moriarty, and others in the Defence Force area, and we want to make sure that people get this analysis at the same time as the review is taking place into a way forward in terms of the Future Submarine Program. It is important, given the relationship with AUKUS as well, that we have this solid, comprehensive review because it is in our national interest to do so, and that is why the government has made this position.</span>

There is one date in particular that sticks in my mind over the last four months, and it is 21 May 2022. On 21 May 2022, 77 members of the Australian Labor Party were elected to the House of Representatives. Those 77 people were elected with a very clear mandate: to end the waste and the rorts that dominated those opposite, to end the corruption that occurred by establishing a national anticorruption commission, to make sure that we had fairness in the workplace by reforming industrial relations, to give the lowest-paid workers on $20.33 an hour a $1-an-hour increase, something that those opposite said would ruin the economy. We were elected with a mandate for increased investment in public housing, through our housing Australia future fund.</span>

                  </a>  I was asked about the last four months and I am going through the last four months, which, I must say, I have had worse four months. I've got to say that, because in the last four months what we've also done is advance the interests of the Australian people who have wanted action on climate change, with a 43 per cent reduction by 2030 when the legislation will be carried. We have been moving forward the debate about climate change, working with business, working with unions and working with civil society. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, as well, we've convened the Jobs and Skills Summit that will occur within four months of that election on 21 May. That's why we also introduced into this parliament—and will carry through both houses—10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. That's why already we are taking action to implement the recommendations of the aged-care royal commission. That's why we've already made moves on the robodebt royal commission. This is a government that has taken up the mantle, both before and now, of preparing a solid agenda for a government that is forward looking and for a government that actually governs—as opposed to just engaging in cheap, tawdry politics everyday. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In 1985, the Hawke government and defence minister Kim Beazley commissioned the head of joint intelligence at the time, Paul Dibb, to undertake a defence strategic review, which he handed down in March 1986. It was the underpinning of the strategic settings for the <span style="font-style:italic;">1987 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">efence white paper</span> and every white paper since, including the most recent in 2016. It was a seminal piece of work which has given us strategic thought around defence for the last 35 years. Central to it is an idea that if anyone means to do Australia harm we will be given a 10-year warning. The <span style="font-style:italic;">2020 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">efence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">strategic update</span> observed for the first time that we are within that 10-year window. It was a profound observation, and one with which this government agrees. It has left a very big question hanging: given that, what are we going to do about it? And the job of answering that question has been given to the Defence Strategic Review that the Prime Minister and I announced this morning. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You could not want two more eminent and qualified Australians to undertake that review: Professor Stephen Smith, the former defence and foreign affairs minister, and Sir Angus Houston, the former Chief of the Defence Force. This review will look at issues of force posture—this is the force posture review that we committed to during the election—but it will do much more. It will look at questions of structure and capability and ask and answer foundational questions. Given the complexity of the strategic circumstances that we face, given the difficulty of those circumstances, what is the job that we want our Defence Force to do? In that sense, this review will be much more significant even than the Dibb review of 1986. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've asked Sir Angus and Professor Smith to report in the first part of next year, and this will happen concurrently with the body of work that is being undertaken with the United States and the United Kingdom under the banner of AUKUS to provide Australia with a nuclear powered submarine capability. That's important, because it will allow both bodies of work to apprehend each other and will allow them to cross-pollinate. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, these bodies of work will provide the strategic foundation for defence thinking for decades to come. Underpinning both will be a core mission: how do we keep Australians safe? That will always be the first priority of the Albanese government. </span>

                  </a>  Prime Minister, you often speak about the role of public housing in your life. There are currently 162,500 households on the social housing waiting list around the country. Since 2018, that number has increased by 7,662 homes a year on average. Your Housing Australia Future Fund promises to build just 4,000 social homes a year for five years. Prime Minister, won't your policy see the waitlist grow, denying hundreds of thousands of people the same chance you had in your life?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:26</span>):  I thank the member for Griffith for his question and I congratulate him on his election to this House. I indeed do understand the importance of having a secure roof over your head and what that can do for the opportunity to advance in life. I know it because I have lived it, and that is one of the reasons why we went to the election with a substantial program—our Housing Australia Future Fund, a $10 billion fund, the returns of which will be used to build around 30,000 social and affordable houses over the next five years. But we won't just do that. We'll also establish the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council, which will work with state and local governments, importantly, to deliver increased housing, be it social housing or affordable housing, particularly through community housing organisations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the member's political party has substantial representation in local government, and I'd encourage him to encourage the Greens political party to back affordable housing rather than just oppose it. In my local area, when there have been programs in Marrickville, they've been opposed. I'm talking about the sorts of inclusive programs whereby councils can work with developers to get increased numbers of social housing units in return for an increase in size but one which then delivers that mix that you need as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things we've learnt over the years—and various research has shown this—is that, when we look at increases in social housing, we need to make sure that we don't create pockets whereby there are areas people grow up in where they don't know and don't have role models for people who work, where you don't have a mix of incomes. Part of my vision for the country is one whereby you won't know what income people have from just looking at their postcode. I'm quite happy to work with the member on this issue, and to work across the parliament, because it is very important that we do that.</span>

                  </span>This is an issue that I've raised with state and territory governments. We have the next meeting of the National Cabinet tomorrow morning, and we will continue to work constructively. We know that pressures are on people, particularly renters, at the moment, and we want to look at ways in which we can improve housing affordability across the board. We also have the Help to Buy Scheme, the Regional First Home Buyer Support Scheme and other programs. I would be pleased to work constructively with the— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Our Powering Australia plan released in December last year was the most comprehensive plan ever put forward on these issues by an opposition and, indeed, was more comprehensive than any plan put forward by the former government over the previous 10 years. It understood that the cheapest form of new energy is renewable energy. We understood as well, working with the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the National Farmers Federation, that what business wanted was investment certainty going forward. That investment certainty will encourage them to be able to look beyond just the short-term horizon towards the five-, 10-, 20- and 30-year cycles that you need when it comes to investment in new clean energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also understood the opportunity that comes with that. This is about using that cheaper, cleaner energy, working with the National Reconstruction Fund, to support existing industries to transition but also supporting new industries to grow—new industries in advanced manufacturing, new industries making more things here and making our country more resilient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the pandemic that Australia's very vulnerable if we are just at the end of supply chains, so we have to come up with plans where we make more things here. The key to that is cheaper energy. The key to cheaper energy is cleaner energy. We know that that's the case. That's why, using the safeguard mechanism and the other parts of the plan—the electric vehicle tax cut that we have already put through the House of Representatives and the plan for community solar batteries—the plan across the board is to work with those businesses which are high emitters to make sure, over a period of time, they lower their emissions consistent with the objective of net zero. It's been well received as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one thing that some of the critics of climate action say that is correct, which is that Australia can't do things just by ourselves. That's why Australia's out of the naughty corner and back negotiating and talking with our friends in the United States, our friends in the region, our friends in Europe and our friends in the Pacific, because we understand that the challenge of climate change is also an extraordinary opportunity to grow the economy and grow jobs. That's why, when this legislation passes both houses of parliament, it will be a great day for Australia.</span>

I note the Prime Minister's long and close association with the lawless and criminal CFMMEU. I also note that the Labor Party has received over $10 million from the CFMMEU since the watchdog was last abolished by Labor. Last week, the Federal Circuit Court gave the maximum penalty to a CFMMEU official for breaching right of entry and making disgusting homophobic slurs to a safety adviser. Prime Minister, why are you compromising the right of people to feel safe at work at the behest of your union backers?</span>

I am also asked about donations in the construction sector. Let me tell you a little story about donations in the construction sector involving Hanssen Pty Ltd, which has donated at least $175,000 to the Liberal Party since 2014. In October 2016, Marianka Heumann, a 27-year-old German backpacker, tragically fell 13 storeys to her death on a Hanssen worksite. Employees were forced to continue working while Ms Heumann lay on the ground, covered with a sheet. Hanssen's company was fined $60,000 for health and safety violations, which Hanssen dismissed as a 'legal technicality'. This is what the judge said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(Mr Hanssen) was blinded by his hatred of the applicants in preventing the taking of logical, rational and reasonable steps of entry and inspection that would have protected and assisted his employees. That was not to their benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018 the company was taken to court—by the union, not by the ABCC—for being knowingly involved in the underpayment of a backpacker under an alleged sham contracting arrangement. The case went to the High Court. It found that the backpacker employed by labour hire company Personnel Contracting was an employee covered by an award, not a self-employed contractor, as he had been designated. He'd been earning 25 per cent less than the award. You'd think that the ABCC might have taken action on that.</span>

So there was $320 million of wage theft, and $1 million recovered.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:37</span>):  I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for her question and thank her for her advocacy on climate action, both directly to me and more broadly, over a long period of time. Today is a good day for our country. It's a good day for our parliament, it's a good day for our economy and it's a good day for our future because, today, it's become clear that the Albanese government's climate bill will pass both houses of parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a decade, the Australian people have watched this parliament and shaken their heads in frustration at the lack of action on climate change, and today we say, 'No more.' Today, the Australian parliament says, 'We have a government that gets it and a parliament that gets it.' Today, parliamentarians of goodwill and good faith have come together to do something good for our country. The member for Corangamite asks what this means for everyday Australians. What it means is investment. It means investment in the cheapest form of energy, in job-creating energy. I recognise that not everybody gets it, but enough people in this parliament get it to make this a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a particular message for the people of regional Australia, who've powered Australia for so long. The people of the Hunter Valley, the people of the Illawarra, the people of the Pilbara, the people of Collie-Bunbury, the people of Portland and the Latrobe Valley: workers there have powered Australia for so long, giving us the energy we need for our economy. They will continue to do so as we turn Australia into a renewable energy powerhouse and as we turn Australia into a renewable export economy, creating good jobs for the future. That's what the Albanese government will do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've said consistently, 'Sure, this legislation is not essential for our agenda and we can get on with the things that we want to do, but this legislation is vital for investment.' You would have thought the so-called party of free enterprise would like investment in energy generation. You would have thought the so-called party of certainty for business would like a certain investment framework, but this party, which gave Australia 22 energy policies over a decade and couldn't land one, doesn't want to land another one now, even from opposition.</span>

I'd simply ask that we continue to enforce the rule the way we previously had.</span>

Today, the Australian parliament reflects the will of an Australian people who want to see meaningful action on climate change and who want to move beyond that toxic combination of ideology and idiocy which has characterised the last decade of climate policy from those opposite. They want to move beyond that and to embrace the economic and environmental opportunities presented by meaningful action on climate change. I pay tribute to the Prime Minister and the minister and to every member of this parliament who wants to see that meaningful action on climate change so that we can embrace properly, after a decade of inaction, the opportunities that are presented to us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A better future relies on a more productive economy powered by cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy. A wasted decade on energy policy and a wasted decade of flatlining productivity has come with serious costs and consequences for the Australian people. The Productivity Commission report out today shows that the last decade's productivity growth has been the slowest in more than half a century. That has meant that gross national income is $4,600 lower per Australian than it would have been if productivity growth had kept pace with the long-term average.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So those opposite pretended for all those years that productivity would be growing at 1½ per cent, despite the 20-year average being 1.2 per cent, and we've had to clean that up in the budget assumptions that I released to the parliament last week. We understand that we will only get the growth we need in our economy and the wages growth that's been missing for a decade of wage stagnation and deliberate wage suppression if we make our economy more productive. That's the focus of the jobs summit, and that's the focus of our economic plan: skills, childcare reform, investing in key industries, in supply chains, and doing something meaningful and ambitious about cleaner, cheaper and reliable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a crucial economic reform. It's why today is so important to the future of our economy—because cleaner and cheaper energy is about jobs; it's about investment certainty; it's about creating new industries and leveraging our traditional economic strengths. For too long, as the climate wars raged in this country, these opportunities have gone begging. That's made our economy weaker and it's made Australians poorer at the same time. For too long, investors, employers and businesses have been denied the policy certainty and vision that they've needed to make investments in the future. That's why the business community is lining up to support our government's Powering Australia plan. It's why Australians lined up on election day to make their views known as well. And it's why, after a decade of dithering, delay and denial, we will move beyond the ideology and idiocy of those  opposite and we will get this done. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But when the Australian people really needed him to speak up about that 20 per cent increase in electricity prices that he intervened to keep quiet about during the election he was absolutely nowhere to be found. It was the same with the captain's call made by the Leader of the Opposition, who said we should extend the petrol excise relief.

We've said all along that when you inherit a budget that is absolutely heaving with $1 trillion in Liberal Party debt you've got to work out what your priorities are. Our priorities are child care, skills, the cost of medicine, getting wages growing again and investing in the energies of the future—cleaner, cheaper and more-reliable energy—all the issues that we took to the election and won a mandate for. In many ways, they are the reason we are on this side of the House and you, thankfully, are on that side of the House. We've been consistent all along.</span>

This is the party that demands an invite to a jobs summit they want cancelled. If you were to believe the wise words of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span>, this is the party that got John Howard in to teach them about the future. You cannot believe a word that those opposites say about the cost of living. When it comes to the cost of living, the member for Hume, in particular, should be ashamed of himself.</span>

We are taking action. For example, the Investor Group on Climate Change has estimated that the Climate Change Bill, which will pass both houses of parliament, will unleash up to $131 billion of investment in our energy system. We're getting on with the job of modernising our energy grid and rewiring the nation to get the electricity, the renewable energy, from where it's produced to where it's consumed, creating thousands of jobs as we do so. We're getting on with the job of creating 400 community batteries across our country, of creating solar banks across our country and of creating 10,000 new energy apprentices, which we'll be saying more about in coming months, to give Australians, and young Australians in particular, the skills to take advantage of the renewable energy revolution, because we on this side of the House believe in some fundamental premises—mainly, that the best form of new energy is the cleanest and cheapest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It happens to be the case that the best form of energy is clean energy, and that's cheap energy. And that means making some tough decisions, I have to say. We have had to make some difficult choices, like rejecting the most expensive form of energy, and the slowest to deploy. That was a tough decision that the government had to take, after much deliberation—to reject the slowest and most expensive form of energy available!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We got some expert advice from an organisation that I know those opposite don't like. It's called the CSIRO. It's a scientific organisation. I recommend it to those opposite. It recently examined the cost of energy and found that the cheapest energy was renewables. The CSIRO <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost 2021-22</span> report said that renewables remain the cheapest new-build electricity generation option in Australia. It found that the most expensive form of energy was nuclear and, also, that this could not be deployed until 2030. I'm not sure how you reduce emissions between now and 2030 with a form of energy that can't be deployed until 2030 and is expensive. Firm renewables are $46 a megawatt hour. The small modular nuclear reactor that the opposition seems to like is up to $326 a megawatt hour—the most expensive and slowest form of energy.</span>

Or you can have a meal in a week's time that is more expensive.' You ask for a nice Wagyu beef and you get a well-done Angus instead.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:54</span>):  I thank the member for Mackellar for this really important question, because the World Health Organization has described climate change as the greatest threat to public health in the 21st century. They estimate that, between 2030 and 2050, 250,000 people every year will lose their lives as a direct result of a warming planet. The impact in Australia will be profound, in a continent that already pushes us right up against the limits of human tolerance. Heat related deaths will increase. The health effects of more frequent and intense extreme weather events will grow substantially, and vector-borne disease will start to creep southward. The dengue fever exposure zone, for example, is expected to move as far south as Rockhampton by the middle of the century and as far south as northern New South Wales by the end of the century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're already seeing this. Separate from the tragic fatalities caused by the Black Saturday bushfires more than a decade ago, that heatwave in Victoria caused 374 heat related deaths, as well as a 700 per cent increase in cardiac call-outs to the Victorian ambulance service. As with so much in this policy area, Australia lags the rest of the world in climate and health, after nine long years of denial and inaction. But that will change under this government. The first and the most important step, obviously, is to take real action on climate change. I congratulate my friend and colleague the Minister for Climate Change and Energy for the bill that he has brought before this House, and I acknowledge the constructive engagement by the member for Mackellar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, though, we know that good climate policy is good public health policy. Renewable energy is not just good for the climate; it also removes dangerous particulate pollution from the atmosphere and improves public health, as do electric vehicles. I've already commissioned advice from my department about the implementation of the election commitment to which the member for Mackellar refers and I've already had an early discussion with state and territory health ministers about how we can work together, Labor and Liberal alike, to reduce emissions from the health sector as well as improve its capability to deal with the risks and the opportunities that come with climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation before the House today is an important first step in ending nine long years of denial and inaction, but, alongside sectors like manufacturing, transport, energy, agriculture and mining, the health sector also needs a focused plan to deal with climate change, and we are getting on with the job of making that plan.</span>

It is clear that only an Albanese Labor government is committed to taking ambitious action on climate change. Through our Powering Australia plan we will deliver more jobs to regional Australia, which is close to my heart and should be a passion for everyone across this chamber. Five out of every six jobs created through our Powering Australia plan will be in the regions.</span>

Our plan ensures that there will be a clean energy industry right across this nation and that we will prioritise the decarbonisation of existing industries. Our plan will prioritise investment and growth in the regions, which have long been Australia's energy engine room.</span>

It's part of our government's pledge to reduce carbon emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050. This side of the House takes seriously the need to reduce carbon emissions. This side of the House takes seriously the need to take action on climate change. And this side of the House takes seriously the need to boost and grow jobs in regional Australia.</span>

I thank the member for Holt for her question on this very important issue. I congratulate her on her election to this place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to improving and adapting to the needs of currently serving defence personnel, veterans and their families. The Australian community has a clear expectation that veterans and their families will be well looked after. We are committed to delivering a package of practical supports—measures that will improve the welfare and wellbeing of veterans and their families. That's why I was so pleased to introduce legislation just today that will achieve that. It will go to supporting families who are bereaved and those who are in crisis, no matter the nature of that crisis. This legislation demonstrates that the new Albanese Labor government is committed to addressing and providing greater support to defence personnel, veterans and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the services front, we will develop 10 new veterans and families hubs that will bring services together in communities where veterans actually live, making them accessible and tailored to the needs of veterans in those communities. In this week, Homelessness Week, I'm very happy to say that the Albanese Labor government has committed $30 million towards addressing veteran homelessness, making sure that we're addressing the unique needs of our veterans facing homelessness or at risk of homelessness and we're providing the services that they need to address that. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We of course are committed to making sure that veterans can get a job, because we know that is a clear pathway to success back into the civilian life for veterans and their families. Our Veterans' Employment Program is about not just connecting veterans to jobs but making sure that employers know the great benefits that a veteran can provide to them and to their business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now we have the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. Defence and veteran suicide is a national tragedy. We listened to the families of veterans and defence personnel who have taken their lives, in supporting the call for this royal commission to be established. I look forward to receiving the interim report from that royal commission when it is handed down next week. I also look forward to meeting with my state and territory veteran minister counterparts in the coming weeks so that we can work together to make sure that across the country we are delivering a better future for our veterans.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For context, let me run through what exactly led to the decisions I've been asked about. Back in 2019, the former government ripped away the ability to recruit overseas trained doctors from 140 GP regions which for years had depended on overseas trained doctors to fill their consulting rooms. That was removed with the stroke of a pen. I can tell you that a number of MPs on this side organised discussions with patient groups and with doctors to run through what that meant for those local communities. Members in the Hunter Valley, like the new member for Hunter, the member for Patterson and the member for Shortland, as well as the candidate for Leichhardt and the senator for Far North Queensland, told me what that meant for the people of Cairns and what it meant for the Hunter Valley to have those consulting rooms hollowed out—utterly hollowed out—with the stroke of a pen by the former government.</span>

There is still much to do to undo the damage of those opposite.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:08</span>):  Thank you, Member for Paterson. She, like many of us, knows the transition to cleaner, cheaper energy will provide huge opportunities for Australian manufacturing and jobs. We know that Australian manufacturers have been under enormous pressure, with energy making up a big part of their production costs. Rising prices, especially of gas, have been something of concern to them, so getting access to cleaner, cheaper energy is very important. We've come to government with a big agenda to reinvigorate manufacturing, to rebuild our industrial base and to build regional employment and secure, well-paying jobs now and into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, reported in June that in five of Australia's industrial regions—Pilbara and Kwinana in WA, Gladstone in Queensland and the Hunter and the Illawarra in New South Wales—the transition to renewables and cuts to emissions could result in nearly 380,000 jobs. So as part of that process we have planned to invest $100 million in a battery manufacturing precinct in regional Queensland, and our national battery strategy will tap into the interest and enthusiasm across the nation to be involved in onshore battery manufacture. If we get this right, we're advised we could create 34,000 jobs and generate $7.4 billion a year into the economy by 2030 and that's before we even get to the 10,000 new energy apprenticeships we want to deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've missed opportunities in clean energy manufacture before and we determined that shouldn't be repeated. Labor has plans to deliver a capacity for renewables manufacturing through our National Reconstruction Fund. We have set aside a billion for value adding in resources that will ensure we transform the minerals we are extracting into high-value products that the global economy will need in the future. Frankly, if we mine it here, we should make it here. We have also earmarked $3 billion for renewable and low-emissions technology in our Powering Australia sub fund in the NRF, targeting green steel, aluminium, clean energy component manufacturing, developing a domestic hydrogen industry and much more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Rewiring the Nation plan has also been noticed by the owner of one of Europe's biggest renewable energy companies, which last month announced a $26 billion investment in the Australian renewable energy sector. Its CEO, Jose Manuel Entrecanales, explicitly stated that the election of our government was the reason for this investment, saying 'the Labor government policy to put $20 billion into the electricity transmission grid was essential to' their plan. We are determined to produce cheaper, cleaner energy and create the jobs required into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  I want to take this opportunity to respond to a question asked of me by the member for Gippsland yesterday. In response to the member's query, I have reviewed the previous use of the term 'rort' by members. The particular expressions used are important in determining whether something is in order. Recent practice is that 'rort' has been permitted in circumstances where it is used to describe the nature of behaviour or an activity. This term is not permitted, however, when it is ascribed as personal behaviour to an individual member. That usage clearly would be an unparliamentary use of the word 'rort' and, if so used, a member would be asked to withdraw. I can assure the member I am listening carefully to the questions and to the answers. As a general reminder, members should raise any points as appropriate at the time they occur. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  On 19 July many refugees entered their 10th year in detention in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. In the Australian Labor Party national platform 2021—prior to the election—it's written: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Under Labor's policies, unauthorised arrivals who enter for the purpose of seeking asylum will be mandatorily detained, for management of health, identity and security risks to the community. Labor will strive to ensure this is for no longer than 90 days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 216 people remaining in Australia's offshore facilities. They have been detained for over nine years now. Today is the 72nd day since the Prime Minister was sworn in, so I would argue that 90-day goal of process is running dangerously short. I urge the Prime Minister and the government to act urgently to end the suffering of those seeking refuge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I met with Betelhem and Ismail, who each spent years in offshore detention before being transferred to onshore detention in the Park Hotel in Melbourne. They described the dehumanising experience, the uncertainty driving deterioration of physical and mental health, and the pain of being separated from family indefinitely. Both Betelhem and Ismail are now living in the community, working and contributing to the vibrant communities in which they live. They told me of their sorrow for those who are still in Nauru and in Papua New Guinea. I was embarrassed, as an Australian, to sit in front of these people and feel deeply responsible for their suffering and the suffering of their friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of those who remain in offshore detention are from Afghanistan. Since the takeover by the Taliban last year, they clearly do not have a safe home to return to. There's the exhaustion of those who are now entering their 10th year of detention, engaging in the tiresome processes of the paperwork needed to be resettled in the USA, Canada or New Zealand with no time line and without adequate health care to make sure they're even well enough to engage in the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was proud to support Amnesty International's Game Over campaign to finally get agreement on the New Zealand deal to resettle refugees there. But this leaves those in Papua New Guinea completely abandoned by Australian authorities, leaving UNHCR to take up the negotiation for their resettlement separately. The majority of those who remain in offshore detention have a pathway to resettlement, so there is no reason not to bring them to Australia to recover their health and spend time in community while they wait for resettlement elsewhere. Betelhem's and Ismail's stories are, unfortunately, all too familiar to the teams at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, Amnesty International and the Refugee Advice &amp; Casework Service who provide vital support services to these vulnerable people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to urgently accelerate resettlement processes with New Zealand, the United States and Canada; bring to Australia all those in offshore detention with resettlement pathways while they await resettlement; implement the policy of their national platform; cap processing and detention at 90 days; allow refugees and asylum seekers to work, to provide these people with an improvement in their quality of life and to address national workforce shortages; and provide a permanent pathway to those on temporary protection visas and adults on bridging visas the right to study. It is outrageous that we stand in this place and talk about skill shortages in so many caring industries where we need people to be able to contribute, and yet we have refugees in detention in our community unable to contribute in the way in which they would like to. We are better than this. We are better than the Australia that, for the last 20 years, has treated horrifically those trying to seek refuge and a better life in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to close the door on our shameful offshore detention and processing of refugees, our shameful treatment of those coming to our shores for a better life, and make sure we now turn a page to much better policies and a humane treatment of refugees. We must do this in a timely way. I know the community of Warringah cares deeply about this, as do the constituents of many of the others on this crossbench, where communities have had enough of the political parties using the fate of these incredibly vulnerable people as political footballs. I urge the government to do better on this.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  Deputy Speaker Claydon, I think this is my first opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation. It's great to see you sitting in that chair as Deputy Speaker, and I look forward to the work that you will do in the chair and in the broader responsibilities you have for this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Warringah for putting this motion before the House. I think it is fair to say that it is the first genuine matter of public importance that has been put before the House in this, the 47th Parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that she has taken the House to a number of elements of Labor's national platform. Let me be very clear: we are determined—and, as minister responsible for many of these issues, I am determined—to implement all of the aspects of the platform. I say to the member for Warringah and, indeed, to all of the members of the crossbench, with many of whom I've had the opportunity to start discussions about these matters and engage about their concerns and their ideas—including the member for Clark, of course—that I am keen to work with them. I am determined to change the tone of debate on these issues. It is probably the case that we are not always going to agree about every aspect of this very challenging area of public policymaking, but I am determined that no more, as the member for Warringah has just said, will vulnerable human beings be used as political footballs in this place or more broadly in the political debate in Australia. It has been coarsened for too long. That must end. It does end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy have talked about ending the climate wars, and it looks like we are making real progress in this parliament to do that. We also need to do something very similar so that we can work on playing the role that Australia must play as an exemplar in the context of the world in which we live—the world that is beset by the awful conflict in Ukraine, the terrible circumstances in Afghanistan and circumstances across the world which mean that today there are more people forcibly displaced than at any other time in human history. That is a call to action domestically but also a call for constructive engagement regionally and globally. That is something that I think every member of the House should be involved in and concerned for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Warringah spoke very effectively about her meeting with Betelhem and Ismail. I didn't meet with Betelhem, but I did meet with Ismail, and with Thanush, a young man who I've met with on many occasions, and I bore witness to their experiences. I say this in respect of the issues about those people in offshore detention: 10 years ago, the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key, made an offer that that group of people be resettled. Had that offer been accepted, every single one of those people would have been resettled and would have been rebuilding their lives productively in New Zealand. Of course, there are many who are also doing that in the United States right now. These are things that should have been addressed many, many years ago. I am appreciative that the government of New Zealand's offer was lately accepted by the former government, and I have been pleased to be in discussions with Minister Wood. I know Minister O'Neil has also been in discussions with our counterparts in New Zealand to make sure that that very generous offer can move forward in an expeditious manner so people can rebuild their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm conscious also that the matter of public importance before the House deals with the detention of refugees—and, I think it's fair to say, people seeking asylum as well as refugees—who are on shore in the immigration detention network. Can I say this: the state of the network is something that is of great concern to me. It is also of great concern to me—as it was in opposition, it is now in government—that people should be held in immigration detention as a matter of last resort. That is something that we called for in opposition. It's something that I'm working my way towards as a member of this government. But that also requires me to think about those people who are for the moment required to be held in immigration detention facilities. I should point out that there are fewer people in those facilities now than there were at the election of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some concerning reports that have been put to me about conditions and incidents in detention, all of which I take with the utmost seriousness, including, of course, the tragedy in Yongah Hill about six weeks ago, which caused me to visit that centre and see for myself the conditions there. I did so after being briefed by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. In the exercise of their responsibilities to provide oversight for the network, they have made a number of recommendations which we're working through. They are very sensible recommendations which deserve serious attention. The opportunity to engage with the Ombudsman is important to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are, of course, not the only body with a responsibility in this regard. I've also met with the Australian Human Rights Commission to work through some of their concerns and to consider some of their feedback about how we can do a better job at ensuring that anyone who is in the network is safe at all times and their human rights are consistently protected and upheld. I've also met with the Red Cross to work through some of the issues and with organisations that look to the specific needs and concerns of the minority of immigration detainees who are women. There are some particular concerns there that require some further work on the part of government. I have also met, of course, with the UNHCR to work through the issues they have in this regard, as well as engaging with them on their ideas around some of the concerns about regional processing, which the member for Warringah has stepped us through. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all significant issues that require work. I'd like that work to be a collaborative process, in the spirit with which this motion has been brought forward. I think, Member for Warringah, that you and I have some time to discuss these matters later in the week, and I'm sure that will be an ongoing dialogue—a respectful dialogue—that I hope can also involve other members of the crossbench and, of course, members of the Greens. I should say that I've been pleased to engage with Senator McKim too, who has portfolio responsibilities in that regard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues that are put before the House now are of concern to the people that I represent and to many of my colleagues and friends here. They are matters that have been of concern to me since long before I was elected to this place. These are issues that are within the capacity of this government—and this parliament—to substantially advance, particularly if we are all prepared to look at the interests of vulnerable human beings seeking our help, on the one hand, and the broader questions that go to our national interest and maintaining a secure border on the other. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are issues that sometimes raise some very complex and challenging policy questions, but the politics of this needn't be challenging. If we can walk away from the use of these people as political collateral, then that work, that shared responsibility in this place to achieve more durable solutions more quickly, will be so much easier. We will be better as a parliament for that, and we will be so much better as a community. That is something that I am determined to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I started my remarks by talking about the tone of this debate. It is a debate that has coarsened us as a nation. I think we have to reflect on that.

                  </a>  'Children overboard', as the member for Cowan reminds me. Over and over again, we have seen shocking political abuses of vulnerable people. We have seen the politics of fear deployed too often in this place and much too often in the media. That has been to the cost of all of us, and most particularly to our cost as a country that has historically been an exemplar in this space. When we think about modern Australia, it is impossible to overlook the fact that since World War II we have resettled 930,000 refugees. It is impossible to conceive of the country we live in today—this vibrant, diverse and dynamic multicultural society—without thinking about the contribution of those 930,000 people: their resilience, their strength, their talents and their contributions. Everything we do in this space must seek to honour that—to honour our best side—to the world.</span>

I'd put it slightly stronger than that: we can only maintain strong borders if we elevate our compassion and humanity.</span>

In my electorate of North Sydney, both the North Sydney and Lane Cove local government areas have long been refugee welcome zones, demonstrating compassion for refugees and acknowledging the tremendous contribution these people have made and continue to make to our lives. Yet it remains that at the federal level many people—arguably still in this place—are simply out of step with the community values of fairness and decency, and the policies of successive Labor and Liberal governments over decades have fallen short of Australia's international obligations and our community's expectations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under former Prime Minister Howard, policymakers and the media shifted the language around refugees. These people became known as 'illegals', 'illegal asylum seekers' or 'queue jumpers'. In doing this, we denied them the fundamental truth of who they are and what they need: refuge in a nation that, up until that point in time, had been known as a welcoming country. But over the past two decades political expediency and cynicism have won out. Dog-whistling fear has won out over compassion. Now is beyond time for this change, and we must start with an immediate end to the indefinite detention of refugees both here in Australia and offshore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By its very nature, mandatory detention is arbitrary and thus contrary to international law. Despite this, as of March 2022 Australia is holding 1,512 people in detention facilities, including 1,450 men and 62 women. Offshore, more than 200 people remain stuck in detention in Nauru or Papua New Guinea, and, since offshore processing began in 2012, the Australian government, our government, has sent around 4,183 people to Nauru or Papua New Guinea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For these thousands of people that both Labor and Liberal governments have kept under lock and key over the past decade, the average length of detention has been steadily increasing and is now, according to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, the highest it has ever been, at 726 days. That has turned into 726 nights of not being able to sleep in peace, not finding yourself in a safe place you can call home. Another way to think of it is 17,424 hours away from family and friends. The absolutely heartbreaking thing is that some people seeking refuge have been locked in detention for even longer. Over 120 people were held in detention by our nation for five years or more, with several having spent more than 10 years in detention. That's 87,600 hours. The truth is that every minute in every one of those hours has felt like a lifetime. In this cruelty, Australia is truly a global outlier. We are unique in locking people up on a mandatory basis and without time limits. In comparable jurisdictions such as the United States it's about 55 days. In Canada it's 14 days. Faster turnarounds can and must be achieved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I met with three courageous people, Ismail, Thanush and Betelhem, who came to Australia seeking safety and protection. Instead, successive governments have dished up nothing but cold-hearted cruelty, uncertainty and fear. Ismail told me he spent seven years—that's 61,320 hours—in detention. He started out as a young, healthy, strong man, but he admitted that even he has been broken by detention. Ismail left a son who was only months old when he fled, and he has not seen him since. Now Ismail, released only four months ago, lives in the community but is unable to work and describes himself as a living ghost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a renewed commitment by Australia to comply with its international legal obligations, to begin to repair our reputation as a good international citizen and a leader in human rights. Community based alternatives to detention should be used whenever possible, and surely it goes without saying that children should never ever be detained. The first step of dismantling the cruelty of indefinite detention is that the remaining 216 people who have sought our safety and protection must be evacuated from Nauru and Papua New Guinea.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Assistant Minister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  Australia has a proud history of welcoming new migrants to our nation. Our economic and social prosperity was built on the back of migrants, and we thank them for their wonderful contribution to our nation. At last year's census it was indicated that 30 per cent of the Australian population was born overseas and almost half of Australians—48.2 per cent—have a parent who was born overseas. In our homes we speak about 200 different languages. We boast about 180 different ancestries and we practise many different religions and theologies. But we do so in an environment of peace, respect and goodwill. That is the key to the success of Australia's multiculturalism and our diversity, and it's made Australia one of the most successful multicultural nations in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that success didn't come on the back of luck. That success was built on government policy that promoted a culture of migration and of supporting multiculturalism and diversity in Australia. Importantly, it was built on government policies that supported those principles. The key to that is successful settlement and integration into Australian society for new migrants. It's in providing settlement services, English language services, housing for new migrants, schooling for their children and, importantly, access to skills training and employment so they can participate in the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For government to successfully provide those services, we must have an orderly and government-supported migration program. It's often in that program that we have the key to prevent having migrants living in poverty, being illegal workers with no welfare support, as we see in many other nations. So the success of Australia's migration program has been built on an orderly, structured government-sponsored program. Our migration intake each year includes a number of humanitarian visas as part of a refugee program. In international comparisons, Australia does its bit when it comes to resettling refugees. A UNHCR report covering 2015 to 2021 indicated that Australia resettled the fourth-largest number of refugees through the UNHCR, at about 25½ thousand refugees. When it comes to internationally displaced people and urgent conflicts like in Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine, Australia acts quickly and decisively to offer humanitarian support and resettle people as quickly as possible. When they come to Australia, of course they deserve that support and that resettlement program that the government offers to make their resettlement a success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But to ensure that success it's important that people come through that government program. That is the key to that success, and it is the key to ensuring that we have the health, education and housing services to support newly arrived migrants. In the past some people have sought to arrive outside that resettlement program. They've undertaken boat journeys. We all know the reasons people get into that desperate situation and take those boat journeys, but it did result in tragic and deadly consequences. A large number of vulnerable people, in particular children, lost their lives. A tough policy was put in place in Operation Sovereign Borders. It's supported by this government, and it will remain in place, because it has worked. But it has resulted in some people being transferred offshore and being in detention because, when their applications were assessed, they failed security and criminal records checks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to make it clear, as the minister did, that as a principle this new government believes that if an asylum seeker has no security issues, health or safety issues or other adverse issues then they should be able to live in the community until their application is finalised. The new government is working to achieve that. There is a backlog, and we're trying to work through that backlog as quickly as possible, and the minister is doing a great job in doing that. We've also offered humanitarian visas to 8,600 Ukrainians in the interim, as well as people from Afghanistan. We are trying to do it as humanely as possible, but that principle of ensuring that people can live in the community if they have no adverse security issues remains. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:39</span>):  Why do people become asylum seekers and refugees? Is it a choice? Who would leave their family, friends and homeland to take a dangerous journey to a foreign country and, in the case of Australia, to then face long-term or indefinite detention, if they had a choice? Consider further how, after fleeing war, strife and persecution, one might be affected by indefinite detention—hope all but taken away, physical and mental health issues developed and then compounded as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spent substantial time in refugee camps: in Darfur in Sudan, where the camps are so vast they're like small cities; in Kakuma in Kenya, again a mammoth humanitarian complex full of traumatised people; in the putrid camps in Rakhine State in western Myanmar and on the Thai<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>Burma border and elsewhere. In Malaysia I have met Syrians and people from Afghanistan who, in some cases, have been waiting in the community for resettlement for decades, with no work, school or health rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having stood on the shore of Christmas Island in 2010 watching Australian Navy divers searching for the dead after a boat ran aground, I have actively argued with asylum seekers and urged them not to take a boat—not because seeking asylum is illegal but for their own safety. Yet some will still make that decision that they must take that step. How do we treat those people? The answer: with cruelty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have ongoingly breached the spirit of the 1951 Refugee Convention. Even after people have been judged through our own system to be genuine refugees we have still denied them resettlement. Those who are in indefinite detention both onshore and offshore must be released into the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government plans to stick with its plan not to permanently resettle people in Australia who come by boat—I don't agree with it—what is the plan? My community in Goldstein has told me loud and clear that we must provide genuine refugees with a path back to hope, family, safety and community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in Goldstein also understand that we may not always be immune from conflict. Things can change quickly, as Ukraine has proved. They argue: treat people the way you would like to be treated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I took a progressive refugee policy to the election, and guess what? Rather than rejecting it, the people of Goldstein rejected the politics of fear. Those who voted for me also supported my call for an independent, expert review of Australia's treatment, detention and processing of people seeking asylum and refugees, and to hold a summit on migration and detention laws to take measurable action on implementing the review's recommendations, with a particular focus on regularising visa status for all in residency limbo and on harnessing community compassion by scaling up well-considered community sponsorship programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's innovate this. Let's spend this political capital while we have it. It's time to consider shifting the billions spent on offshore detention to support refugees in transit countries as well as to reboot a regional approach—a successor to the Bali process involving origin, transit and destination countries. Apart from anything else, it's costing billions in taxpayers' money to sustain cruel and unusual punishment, meanwhile making us an international embarrassment. It's time to address the way that our government treats asylum seekers and refugees. I truly hope that after the minister's comments we can return to a humanitarian refugee policy, rather than treating it as a national security issue. As a first step, I call on the government to urgently end the practice of indefinite detention of refugees both offshore and onshore.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  It's lovely that the member for Fenner has come to join us on this his 50th birthday. I wish you a happy birthday! Thank you to the member for Warringah for bringing this debate, and I appreciate your genuine interest and contribution on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate I represent, on the 2016 census—I haven't actually checked the latest figures—covers the most multicultural part of Australia, the city of Greater Dandenong. I have nearly 200,000 people in my electorate. I note the public discussion about resourcing. At any time we would like to sit down and have a cup of tea and talk about what it's like to represent an electorate with tens of thousands of noncitizens, who create far more work, frankly—and we do our best—than citizens. I've also represented, in previous boundaries, wealthy areas, and I can tell you what generates more constituent work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My staff joke that I'm most popular amongst people who can't vote. Every morning my emails—and not just the ones we get from Afghanistan—are a sea of human misery from people in the community, most of whom, again, are not citizens. I think that in the south-east, in my electorate, we host about a quarter of the asylum seekers resident in Victoria, and I have more people who were born in Afghanistan in my electorate than there are any other electorate in this parliament. So my focus since I was elected has not actually been on the offshore detention; it's been on the human misery and economic carnage that is the Department of Home Affairs and on trying to speed up the visa processing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I made a bit of a contribution on that on Monday night, and I said I'll continue to speak up even if it doesn't always please the ministers or certainly the departmental secretary. But I do acknowledge, from my deep conversations, that many people who are in immigration detention, onshore and offshore, live in my community and have views on this. Many, many, many people still have connections with people in onshore and offshore detention. There's strong community interest. It may surprise people, though, to suggest that actually the majority of people I hear from in my community do not want to see the boats restarted. There's not strong demonstrated, expressed community support for settling people who arrive by boat. I just make that point. </span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HILL:</span>
                  </a>  I'm not suggesting you do. I'm making that point because there have been a number of points made in the debate. The overwhelming focus is on an orderly migration program, where at times you say a quick yes or a quick no, not a 10-year-long maybe, which was the absolute disgrace that we saw under the previous government. So I will fight in this budget and in every budget henceforth for more resources into the visa-processing system. It is without doubt 80 to 90 per cent of the work in my office, and how we've treated people in this country is an abomination—an absolute abomination. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also true, as has been said, that we have more people displaced at the moment in the world than ever before in recorded, modern human history. We've had 20 years of debate in this country on this, the most wicked of public policy problems. If there were an easy solution it would have been found by now. As a public policy nerd—I sat on the Left of the Labor Party and shared in many of the conference debates on this—I've had to accept the hard way the lesson that the policy settings we have in this country have real-world impacts offshore, particularly in the people-smuggling business, and they're factors that we have to take into account in our settings now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of principles, as the government has said, if there are no security or safety concerns then individuals should be living in the community when they're onshore until a durable solution is found—no ifs, no buts. There is also a small cohort of people for whom there are security concerns, and they will not live in the community. They should not, and I totally reject some of the advocacy we've had from the so-called expert groups. Very well-meaning as they are, it doesn't meet community standards. If people have committed serious crimes and they haven't disclosed them, they're not going to live in the community. We've got to recognise there is a cohort there, small and complex as it is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to honour our international obligations under the Refugee Convention, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which have to be at the core of our detention regime. There will be a detention regime in certain circumstances, so part of the policy focus has to be to make sure that it's actually done properly according to international law and subject to proper oversight. It is true that under those instruments Australia is not obliged to give a visa to people who engage our protection obligations if compelling national security or public order considerations apply. The fact is, as I touched on at the outset, Australians overall must have confidence and trust in the integrity of the migration system, which does mean border control and support to orderly migration. In that regard, I do think that our platform commitments, which have been touched on, improve the oversight, the transparency, of detention where it is necessary or important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the minister, who for decades—since you and I met when we were, I think, about 19 years old, a thousand years ago—has been a consistent champion for fairer, more humane refugee policies. We wouldn't find a stronger, more consistent and compassionate advocate in the parliament than, you, Minister, in implementing and finding this very difficult of balances. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  For one year and three months, Mostafa Azimitabar dreamt of sunlight. He said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many people think about buying a house, flying to Europe, visiting their friends … My dream was receiving sunlight. Something that people who are free, they never think about it. They have this beautiful gift, they can walk and they have sunlight. I was dreaming of this. Moz, as he is known, is a Kurdish musician and artist. He fled persecution only to be indefinitely detained on Manus Island for six years. He came to Australia in 2019, under the medevac legislation, for which, I'm very proud to say, the former member for Wentworth was a champion. When that legislation was repealed, Moz once again faced indefinite detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At first, he was in Melbourne's Mantra hotel, where, he says, he could stick a hand out the window of his hotel room to feel sunlight. But then he was moved on to the Park Hotel, where his room had a dark glass window facing a concrete wall. He spent 23 hours a day in that room for months. Of that experience, he says, 'I still cannot understand why it happened.' Neither can I. Australia is one of the most prosperous nations in the country. We have a big heart. We go out of our way to help our neighbours. We look after each other. Frankly, we are built on the back of migration and refugees for absolutely generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indefinite detention is cruel, inhumane and unnecessary. The indefinite detention regime the Australia government has run over the past decade is particularly inhumane. Sexual and physical abuse and self-harm are rampant. Those who've been indefinitely detained have serious long-term health effects, including complex PTSD. Those leaving their families behind to flee warfare and persecution deserve our generosity. They make a rich contribution to our country, which means our treatment of refugees is heartbreaking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my previous job, I was the CEO of the Australian Business and Community Network. I worked with 200 low-socioeconomic schools around Australia, and many of them had a significant number of young refugees in those schools. They were kind and absolutely delightful young people. Their teachers constantly talked about how they were taking their education in all their hands to try and achieve the best lives they possibly could for themselves and for their families. They were assets to our community. Moz himself is an example of the very way refugees enrich Australian life. He was a finalist in this year's Archibald Prize, using a toothbrush and coffee to paint his self-portrait.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wentworth elected me in part because I want a kinder, more compassionate approach to refugees—an approach that recognises the humanity and contribution of people like Moz. Our community saw the compassion that Independents can inject into parliament when the former member for Wentworth, Dr Kerryn Phelps, championed medevac. That legislation saw hundreds of indefinitely detained refugees and asylum seekers come to Australia for urgent medical treatment. I will continue that fight for the fair treatment of refugees. I continue to urge the federal government to find humane solutions for genuine refugees ineligible for resettlement who will remain in the rightless limbo that prevents them from leading meaningful and productive lives in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 19,000 refugees have been living on temporary protection visas for up to 10 years, unable to fully settle in Australia, unable to fully reunite with their families and unable to make their full economic contribution to this country. These people are working here, they're paying taxes here, and their children go to school here. It is not right that we are treating them like second-class citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, during the election campaign, confirmed they oppose temporary protection visas. I urge them to act on those words. I urge the federal government to lift its annual intake of refugees to at least 18,000, to support calls from refugee advocate groups to offer an additional 20,000 humanitarian visas to families fleeing from Afghanistan and to provide additional humanitarian visas to those fleeing war in Ukraine. Labor, during the election campaign, pledged to increase Australia's annual intake to 27,000. I urge them to act on these words. I urge the federal government to end indefinite offshore and onshore detention. Labor committed to a maximum of 90 days of detention. I reflect on the member for Warringah's words, that the Prime Minister has been elected for 72 days. I urge them to act on indefinite detention, for Moz and for the good of the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia mistreated Moz. He is now free, but he will be forever affected by our cruel regime. His story is a reminder of how important it is for us to adopt a kinder, more compassionate refugee program. We have plenty of sunlight to share.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  I begin by thanking the member for Warringah for raising this motion and to echo the words of previous speakers on this side by saying that I suspect this is probably the most serious MPI that most of us have been engaged in. I also thank her for passing on the story of Betelhem and Ismail. As the member for Fraser, my electorate may not be quite as diverse as the member for Bruce's electorate, but I think it would be on the podium. I've heard many similar stories. I haven't met with Betelhem and Ismail, but the stories that she recounted resonated very strongly with me. I feel that during my first term in parliament I've heard many similar stories. Certainly, I've learnt a great deal, and it's informed my approach to the issues that we're dealing with today. These are wickedly complicated issues, but I think we need to listen to people, like the people who have been raised in this debate, if we're going to make humane and sensible decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to say, on a broader level, that Fraser is, I believe, a powerful reflection of refugees and the migrant story more generally. The single largest election commitment that I made was $4.7 million for the Vietnamese Museum Australia. That museum, of course, celebrates 110,000 people that came to this country between 1975 and 1995. Many of them—I suspect the vast majority—were refugees, many making perilous journeys. And at the announcement of that investment at the beginning of that project, Ian MacPhee gave a very powerful speech. What, perhaps, was most powerful for me was the fact that politicians from right across the political spectrum paid tribute to him and, in a sense, paid tribute to a previous age. In that sense, I echo the words of the minister, in saying that, as much as we need to grapple with the content of this issue and the wicked complexity of it, we also need to adopt the appropriate tone. That will help us get to the right solutions in the right manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very powerful for me that there were individuals who I knew well and who are now leaders in my community that had been in refugee camps in the late 1970s and 1980s and remembered Ian Macphee as the minister visiting those camps and, ultimately, making the decision to let them enter this country. Of course, for people at that event, the events in Ukraine resonated very, very powerfully, as I think they have in today's discussion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is an issue where we should be able to reach across the aisle. We're not always going to agree, and there are clearly elements of how we deal with this policy that people in the government are probably not going to agree on with people on the crossbench, such as our commitment to Operation Sovereign Borders. But there is a great deal that I think we can agree on and work productively on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted to make some observations, before we get into some of the detailed policy conundrums, on the fact that, in its platform, Labor is committed to some overarching principles that I think are absolutely critical to this debate. These are that any conditions of detention should reflect the inherent dignity and the safety of the human person. That was something very important to me, as somebody that put a lot of work into the process that led to the platform in the lead up to the last election. Also, of course, that detention is not indefinite or arbitrary. The way that policy operates in practice can often determine whether that is something that works or not. That comes down to issues such as the amount of resourcing that goes into processing. So we have the broad principles that are governing the way in which we want to approach these issues, but in order to have detention that is not indefinite in practice, we need to put more resources into processing people and ensuring that the way in which we treat them is in fact reflective of their inherent dignity and of their safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to reflect the observations of the member who preceded me in this debate, which is that this is a wicked problem. I think many on this side struggle with some of the challenges of balancing our obligations under international conventions with the fact that we are all seeking to find a solution that does not provide an environment or incentives in which people unduly put themselves at risk. As I said, I suspect that people in the government will probably, in general, land on a different position to those opposite, but I very much think that we can all find a common solution, working productively together.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  I'd like to acknowledge not only the very thoughtful contributions of the government members here today, which I think have been really helpful, but also members of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre who've joined us to listen to us talking about this really important issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, may I note, as the member for Wentworth did, that in early 2019, this parliament achieved something remarkable and historic. Representatives from across the political spectrum voted together, with some of them courageously crossing the floor, to pass Dr Kerryn Phelps's medevac bill to create a pathway for critically sick people held in offshore detention to be evacuated to Australia for urgent medical treatment. A majority of members of this House agreed then that giving medical care to people in Australia's care should not be subjected to political interference and that the provision of that treatment should be determined by doctors. I am a doctor, and I believe the experts who have provided evidence to this parliament on behalf of refugees and asylum seekers when they say that no-one is well after 10 years in offshore detention. The previous coalition government repealed the medevac law as soon as it could. I speak on behalf of the electorate of Kooyong today in support of immediately ending the indefinite detention of refugees. This parliament has an opportunity to end the suffering of the hundreds of people still stranded on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea once and for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent study into psychological distress in Australian onshore and offshore immigration detention centres found that detaining a person onshore for more than three months resulted in great psychological stress. Those detained offshore showed even greater psychological distress on all time frames. The MSF report <span style="font-style:italic;">Indefinite despair</span> in 2018 showed that, out of 208 refugees and asylum seekers assessed, 62 per cent had moderate or severe depression, 25 per cent had anxiety disorders, 18 per cent had post-traumatic stress disorder and another 22 per cent had depression, complex trauma or trauma withdrawal syndrome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last decade, 46 people have died in Australian detention centres. Assessments of the causes of these tragic deaths cite lack of access to medical care, including mental health care, as a core contributing factor, as well as deplorable living and hygiene conditions and psychological and physical abuse. Twelve people have died while detained in Australian offshore detention centres. Many of these people are losing their lives to easily treatable disorders such as sepsis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's immigration detention regime causes severe and widespread mental and physical health impacts on people seeking refuge or asylum in this country. I appeal to other doctors in this chamber to join Dr Sophie Scamps and me in our calls to bring the people detained offshore here to Australia, to safety. I urge the government and every member of this chamber to end the financial and moral black hole of offshore detention.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="133646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I want to start by doing what many contributors to this debate have done: thanking everyone for the way they have contributed to the debate. I acknowledge that everyone who has spoken—and most people in this chamber—finds this issue to be a complex, heart-rending and incredibly difficult issue to have to deal with, but they come at it with a deep intention to try to make decisions that are the best for people in circumstances where those decisions are really hard and people aren't going to agree on the decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to say, hand on heart, that I am incredibly proud to be in this parliament and in a government with this minister. The newer members of the crossbench and the government—and, I guess, even the opposition—probably understand that this was the case but haven't experienced what debates about this topic have been like in this parliament previously. It is a monumental change for this parliament to have a minister respond to a matter of public importance like the one that the member for Warringah put up by being thoughtful—not by pretending that all of the decisions of the government are going to be ones that everyone in this parliament agrees with but by being thoughtful, putting a hand out for cooperation and acknowledging the fundamental humanity of people who are seeking asylum. It is a huge change that we should all be grateful for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start the rest of my contribution with this observation: I was 25 years old and working in this parliament in 2001, so I vividly remember <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span>, September 11 and the children overboard saga. For me personally, that was my awakening to the issues of people seeking asylum and how they can be weaponised politically. I assure you it's something I have never forgotten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has to be said that that moment in time in 2001, when the Howard government misled the Australian people by telling them that desperate people seeking asylum in Australia had thrown their children overboard from the boat they were in, when they absolutely had not, sowed the seeds for the destructive, inhumane political weaponisation of desperate people that we have seen for the two decades since. It was an act of political opportunism and of willingness to use the plight of desperate people for political gain that has reverberated through our society. Until this point, it has also made it impossible to have a thoughtful, considered debate on the competing and complex issues about how we deal with people seeking asylum, particularly those who are seeking asylum outside of what are known to be the normal processes. But we do have to have it, and we do have to have it in the way we've had it today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone on this side has emphasised, rightly, that our government is absolutely clear that, if there are no security or safety concerns, individuals should be living in the community until a durable solution is finalised. We have been in power for 72 days, which is not that long to make massive changes. We did get the Climate Change Bill 2022 through, hopefully, but I do urge the crossbench to keep the faith about the things the minister has said that we want to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I absolutely agree that no human being can be well after 10 years in indefinite detention. I have met and spoken with people who have sought to come to Australia on those horrible, rickety deathtrap boats and people who were dragooned into piloting those boats. No-one does that unless they're desperate. We have to protect the lives of people who would seek such a dangerous journey and we have to be humane in the way we deal with people who get here. I want to be part of that conversation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I rise on the matter of public importance: the need for the government to urgently end the practice of indefinite detention of refugees both offshore and onshore. I'd like to acknowledge the very thoughtful contributions of everyone who has participated in this debate today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I would like to state my support for the member for Clark's Ending Indefinite and Arbitrary Immigration Detention Bill 2021. As a doctor, I have grave concerns over the practice of indefinite and arbitrary detention, which is both a breach of human rights as well as an inhumane and unnecessary practice, one that costs Australian taxpayers billions and puts the physical and mental health of those imprisoned under the scheme in danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the government's thoughts that there will be no indefinite detention offshore for people who do not pose a security or safety risk. A recent freedom of information request revealed that there are over 1,400 people currently being detained in Australia's detention centres. While the average time that people are detained is nearly two years, the average time that asylum seekers wait for an outcome on their visa application is even longer at 925 days. This has to end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we know that many asylum seekers and refugees have been detained for much longer. In fact, it took the detention of Novak Djokovic earlier this year to shine a spotlight on the plight of asylum seekers and refugees, some who had been detained for nearly a decade. Australians all over the country were shocked and horrified that these people had been locked away for years and essentially forgotten about. Imagine being detained for nearly 10 years in a small room, all the time not knowing if you will be sent back to the place you fled and feared for your safety, the prime of your life slipping away, your health and your mental health deteriorating due to a cruel and unfair system that targets you for seeking asylum. I believe our treatment of asylum seekers and refugees is a national shame, or it has been, and we must end the practice of indefinite detention immediately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2016 there have been at least 2,650 instances of actual or threatened self-harm by people in Australia's detention centres. That is an average of one person every day either thinking about or attempting to take their own life on account of Australia's policy of locking up asylum seekers and refugees. Mehdi Ali, the brave Iranian asylum seeker who used his voice while in detention on Nauru and in Melbourne's Park Hotel to shine a light on Australia's cruel policy, described his detention as a 'complete trauma'. Mehdi Ali told of witnessing a fellow refugee burn himself to death, describing what he saw with these harrowing words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With my own eyes I witnessed the suicide of one soul destroyed by this island. Death by self-immolation was the worst scene I had watched in my life. This was the new reality for us on Nauru.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The trauma, anxiety, depression, injuries and deaths caused by Australia's inhumane policy of indefinite and arbitrary detention is a stain on the soul of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign, the people of <span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span> told me that the humane treatment of refugees and asylum seekers should be a priority for me and this parliament. My community is standing up to do its bit for refugees. Earlier this year a number of families across <span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span> and the northern beaches opened their home to Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia's invasion of their country. In fact, my own children, when they saw the scenes from Ukraine on our own TV set, made the plea to me that my husband and I please do something. Since April of this year, we too have opened our home to a displaced Ukrainian family. I have heard directly from them the anguish about needing to leave their home, their family and their friends and start a new life here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community in <span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>, like many communities around Australia, is showing the way when it comes to proving we do not need to be cruel when it comes to the treatment of refugees. I believe my community is showing the true spirit of the Australian soul. I believe we can do better than locking up refugees and asylum seekers indefinitely. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I think about the activists across Macnamara who, for not just this election but for years, have raised their voices in support of climate action, people who have turned up to community forums and who have engaged in community groups. The Minister for Health and Aged Care is at the table. In his former capacity as shadow minister for climate change, he joined me at the St Kilda RSL a few years ago and spoke to literally hundreds of concerned people about climate change and what can be done. At that time, at that meeting, there was a deep sense of frustration at the coalition's inaction on climate change. But today we have a chance, and as part of the Climate Change Bill 2022 we have an opportunity, to make change and to take a momentous step forward, and of that I am very, very proud. The responsibility that the people of Macnamara have given me in asking me to represent them in this place is something I hear unequivocally, and I take extremely seriously the request that the people of Macnamara have given me: to say that we need to tackle climate change and we must be part of the solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge organisations like the Port Phillip EcoCentre, who have been tireless in their engagement of our citizens in citizen science and in protecting our local wildlife in a number of our nature reserves, from Westgate Park—underneath the iconic West Gate Bridge—all the way down to our brand new nature reserve, the opening of which is going to happen this week, where we're going to be seeing an incredible dedication of urban land back to the environment. It's going to be a celebration of local indigenous wildlife and plants. The Port Phillip EcoCentre is at the very heart of that, as well as the Elsternwick Park Association. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have PECAN, which is the peak body of many of our climate activist groups locally, who do an outstanding job. They held a climate debate at the last election, which I was proud to be a participant in. The Australian Conservation Foundation has been constantly engaging with me, and I appreciate all of their engagement. I especially appreciate the Macnamara chapter of the Australian Conservation Foundation, whose activists are tireless in their pursuit of better climate action. I also acknowledge the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and, of course, the Labor activists in LEAN—the Labor Environment Action Network—who have, at every single stage, kept the North Star in the front of their minds and focused on how to get action and how to be a part of a parliament that takes action on climate change. And that's what this bill is. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is the product of a significant amount of work that the minister did in opposition, where we put forward our policies, like having over 80 solar banks around the country and 400 community batteries, including at Southbank in my electorate, where we have a huge number of people living in apartments who can't access solar panels on their roofs but want to access cheap, clean, renewable energy. Our community batteries program is one of the really exciting things that we're going to roll out around the country. Then there are our electric vehicle policies, our policies to support agriculture and, of course, the safeguard mechanisms. That was all then modelled, and as part of that model we have seen that it will cost the amount that will be budgeted in the October budget, as well as all the funding that's required as part of the RepuTex modelling. We are going to achieve at least 43 per cent emission reductions by 2030 as a result of those policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all there on the website for people to see. I know that the coalition have been sceptical and say that there are no details. That's clearly because they haven't read the document, which is available on the website for any Australian to go and see—the Powering Australia policy. That, thankfully, is now the policy of the Australian government. It is also the policy that's supported by a whole range of stakeholder groups, including the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Energy Council, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Smart Energy Council and the Clean Energy Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Literally across the economy and across the country, Australians are united in tackling climate change, not just because they're bleeding-heart lefties—as I know many on that side of the House like to bandy around—but because it is good for our economy. Climate action is one of the single most important economic stimulus things that we can do for our next generation. Tackling climate change is literally going to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the Australian economy. It's going to help power businesses via cheaper energy. Our climate action is going to be the thing that powers Australia into the future. We have a desert the size of the Sahara and an offshore wind abundance that is perhaps bigger than that of any other country in the world. Our potential is limitless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to look at what's going on in the Northern Territory right now, where we have a $20 billion investment being made in the Northern Territory as a part of the Sun Cable project to start exporting solar energy to Singapore, potentially powering up to 15 per cent of Singapore's energy needs. That's just the first time that we're exporting solar energy, the first time that Australia can potentially export renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's exciting, and it's jobs—jobs in our regions. I know that there are people on the other side of the House who are afraid of what change might mean, and there are communities that are protective of their own jobs. Of course, that's fine. Of course we support workers in this country. Of course we support workers in the Hunter Valley. Of course we support workers in Queensland. They have literally powered our country, but if we want to think about what is going to be there for the next generation and what sort of jobs we want to create for future generations, what prosperity we want to ensure future generations of Australians to have, it is going to be in these incredible new industries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have got our targets, which are designed by policies and have been modelled by RepuTex, and we are going to legislate them. That is the clearest way to settle on an energy policy, something that those opposite couldn't do, despite 22 cracks at it. We had the NEG, we had Malcolm Turnbull—remember that guy? He lost his job over their energy policies. But we are going to legislate it and it's going to pass both houses of the parliament, something that our economy has been crying out for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this legislation, we are also going to enshrine that legislation, our pathway towards a net zero, in the essential government agencies like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and like the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, so that they take into account government policy, which is to lower emissions to bring our country towards net zero. It is a pretty simple proposition. We will not take the clean energy bit out of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We're not going to take the renewables out of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. We're going to ensure that those agencies and other government agencies are focused on lowering our emissions and achieving Australia's climate change targets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that this bill does is ensure that we reinvest in the Climate Change Authority and that it has all of the resources that it needs to provide frank and fearless advice to the government. The minister will then be required to come into this place and be transparently accountable for Australia's progress in achieving our climate action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> I remember the dark old days of the Morrison government when they completely gutted the Climate Change Authority. There was no accountability. At the dispatch box the minister would pretend that everything was hunky-dory when it clearly wasn't. And the Australian people knew that it wasn't. That's why we're going to create and support the institutions that guarantee Australia does this and does it properly. This is good reform. It is sensible reform. It is reform that the Australian people demanded. It is reform I am really proud of. It is reform that we can all be proud of: that we stood in this place and took a gigantic step forward on climate action. Australians said, 'We want to end the climate wars,' and they're over. Instead of bickering and denial and complete obfuscation, we have a bill—a bill in this place that says Australia is on a pathway towards net zero, and that is the law of this nation. That is something that I am extremely proud to be a part of. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge, obviously, the Prime Minister, but also the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, who has negotiated in good faith with all members of this place except those who dealt themselves out of the conversation. I acknowledge that there are members who are a part of the coalition who would like to still be in this place, and members of the coalition party room now, who wanted to support this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to anyone in this place—and I congratulate the crossbench and any other members who will be supporting this—that this is the right side of history. When Australians look back at this moment and this place to see who was willing to support Australia taking a step forward on climate action and who was willing to deny it, I know where I'm going to be. I know where people on this side of the House are going to be. We're going to be on the right side of history. We are going to tackle this and we're going to take a momentous step forward in our efforts to tackle climate change. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="148150" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  What we have seen today is, once again, the Labor Party being all about feelings. That's fine. You can be about feelings. It'll feel good for people to vote this way because they think that is a good outcome for them, but on this side we are more concerned about facts and the impacts that this will have, particularly in regional Australia. We've even seen the Treasurer say that the budget is about feelings. What's next? The number nine will be upset with the number six because it is not closer to zero? If there was a snake oil salesman around—those opposite would be able to sell that too!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, if we come back to reality, we've seen the Minister for Climate Change and Energy claim multiple times that there will be more than 600,000 jobs in this proposal. Yet he was called out by a former Labor member of this place who said that that was just not factual; it was nonsense. If we want to look at a comparison to see how difficult that is, let's look at what the resources sector delivers for Australia. It puts over $400 billion into the economy and supplies around 270,000 direct jobs. Yet those opposite, including the climate minister, want to claim that they will develop 600,000 jobs in this country from their one policy. Think about the size of the resources sector—how big it is, how many decades it took to develop, how much infrastructure it needed in place to deliver those high-paying jobs in Australia. What it says very clearly is that that is just not the case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, we are talking about feelings. We warned the Australian people at the last election what a Labor-Greens government would look like. We warned them. Those opposite, including the now Prime Minister, said, 'This will not be the case. We won't impact coal; we won't impact oil; we won't impact gas'—those parts of our economy that drive enormous amounts of jobs into regional Australia in particular. Yet today we have seen the Leader of the Greens at the National Press Club declare that a deal's been done. The minister for climate was asked about this in question time and refused to make comment or to answer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the deal. According to the Leader of the Greens, government agencies such as Export Finance Australia, which have in the past funded coal and gas projects, will be forced to take climate targets into account. That would see them curbed from supporting these types of projects—oil, coal and gas. And the new limits will include Infrastructure Australia and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. I say to the government: what are you going to do with the projects that are already approved and perhaps not yet started? Will you once again destroy our international reputation as a place for safe investment? Are you going to take that away as well? Those of us who live in regional Australia and every single Australian that is working in an export industry in regional Australia, whether it is resources or agriculture, know that this is where our jobs come from. If I recall the numbers correctly, over 80 per cent of all of our exported goods come from the regions. These are the reasons that the people we represent have employment. It's how they pay their way. It's how they pay for their home and their mortgage. It's how they put their kids through school. Yet we have now seen a deal between Labor and the Greens that will ensure that those industries are strangled out of finance, even with support from the government. Look at how many jobs are being delivered as a part of these organisations, whether it's EFA or the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund. They are real. They are real projects that have started in the regions and that are underway because they had some support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen Australia's banking sector turn away from Australia's resources sector. What's next? Will it be agriculture? We hear a lot about electricity, but electricity represents only just over 30 per cent of emissions in this country. We don't hear anything from those opposite about what's actually occurred over the last few years, and that is that, when we were in government and across that period of time since 2005, we reduced emissions by 20 per cent. They've gone down. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All I am saying is that we want to see our response be proportional to our contribution. We cannot continue to destroy the things that deliver jobs into our regions, and that is what is now being proposed. We have seen the climate minister say many times, 'We don't need to do this.' Well, then, don't. You are out there saying to regional Australia, 'Your jobs are not warranted; they are not deserved,' and you are going to make sure they don't continue. You have some kind of fantasy that there will be some 600,000 jobs delivered under this one policy. It is really difficult to get that many jobs. It genuinely is. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We continue to hear about feelings, about how wonderful you'll all feel about it, but you have sold out the regions. You committed in the election not to impact them. It doesn't matter whether it's through finance or some other mechanism; those jobs could be gone tomorrow, because it takes finance to run these big businesses. You need to have cash flow. You need to have access to finance. You need to be able to continue to deliver. You only have to look at what has happened on occasions around guarantees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the proposal and we take Mr Finkel's suggestion of 20,000 square kilometres of solar—it doesn't sound like that much—it's two million hectares. Now, for those who don't work in agriculture or who might not work in these big broadscale, broadacre areas, to give you some comparison, the entire Australian sugar industry has less than 400,000 hectares to deliver some 30-odd million tonne of sugarcane. Yet the suggestion is that you will put a blanket over two million hectares of our country. It has to be cleared. It has to be levelled. You have to get cultural approvals. What does this do to the environment?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are putting forward are facts, and these are the facts: quite simply, everyone opposite knows it will only work in the daylight hours; it will depreciate over time; it will need to be replaced; and where I come from there are these things called cyclones. If you have a category 5 cyclone tear across the coast, this equipment is gone. It is just not there anymore. So, whether you look at reliability or availability, quite simply, for utilisation of solar, once again we're back to facts. It is low-20 per cent. For wind turbines, it is low-30 per cent. You cannot just wonderfully wave a magic wand and have electricity generation appear when something else doesn't work. Under all the international engineering standards, once you have penetration of intermittent generation of more than 10 per cent you require one-to-one backup. You have to have one-to-one backup.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal at the moment around batteries is ridiculously expensive. It is extortionately expensive. Quite simply, you are saying to the Australian people that they have to pay that cost. They can't afford it. Right now, interest rates are up, the cost of food is up and the cost of fuel is up. They simply don't have that disposable cash to pay more. That is just a statement of fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at this, when we have two million hectares of solar, what are we going to do when one of those companies goes broke and leaves it there? There should be guarantees on these installations, the same as there have been in many resource projects across the country. What are you going to do with them? If you are going to replace them every 20 years, they'll have to be rehabbed. Someone will have to pay for that. It can't be local government. I'm sure the states won't want to do it. It's pretty straightforward: these are factual issues that need to be dealt with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the idea that you can build transmission lines all over the country. Well, there's this thing called physics. Physics says that it's just not that easy. You're suggesting you have to shift as much energy through a straw as you'd need to shift through six fire hoses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite simply, all we are saying is that we want to see things that work. Of course you can implement intermittent wind and solar. But, once again, once that's above 10 per cent you have to back it up one to one, and that is incredibly expensive. I know I'm coming to the end of my time, and clearly there's something going on, but it is not members of the government who will be impacted by this. It is not members of the government who will have thousands of wind turbines in their backyards—and it is thousands. It is not the members of the government who will have two million hectares of solar.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I look forward to seeing the environmental approvals and cultural approvals to clear two million hectares of land. In Queensland you can't clear land to get productivity for cattle. The idea that you can clear this much is quite simply ludicrous. So you will get to the point where you have to make real decisions to keep the lights on, and right now the option is coal, because those assets are there. So use the technology, use CCS. Keep those things sweated. We need those generators to be in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look across to Queensland. Do you want to know why your power prices are expensive in Queensland? It's because the Premier and the state Labor government put $5 billion on top of their costs. They took a dividend in the last budget of $800 million, which is yet to be paid, and are booking over a billion dollars into their budget from electricity out of the government owned corporations. It is a significant amount of money. It is paid for by all Australians, and they simply cannot afford it. So I implore you once again to make decisions based on facts and physics, not on feelings. It really makes a difference.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker, on your election as Deputy Speaker. I say to the previous speaker, who isn't a bad bloke: for goodness sake, speak about facts when it comes to climate change. Yes, we should listen to the facts and we should listen to the science, because the science is very clear: we need to act. And the facts are very clear: by acting, we can actually create economic activity and create jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that, in our first month in office, we updated our nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement to reflect the target that we were elected on—43 per cent by 2030—and to set Australia on the path to net zero by 2050. We sent a message to the world, to our friends, to business and to our trading partners that, for the first time in a decade, Australia has a government that takes climate change seriously. We have a government that understands the opportunity which is there, particularly for the regions, in acting on climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Passing this legislation will send a great message to the people of Australia—that we are taking real action on climate change, that the decade of inaction and denial is over, and that Australia is out of the naughty corner in international forums and is once again engaging with the global community, who understand the importance of acting on climate change and understand that this is not just an environmental issue but the biggest economic transformation that we will see globally in our lifetime—as big and as significant as the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution was based upon fossil fuels. It brought great prosperity, but we also know that it is changing our climate. That is why we need to respond to the science. Australians know that, by responding, we can create that certainty and can drive new jobs, new industries with new technologies and a new era of prosperity for Australian manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is also about our national security. One thing we found when it came to the pandemic was that Australia needs to be more self-reliant. We need to be able to stand up for ourselves and our economy and to be more self-sufficient. One of the things that cleaner, cheaper energy will do is drive advanced manufacturing in this country. We should continue to export our resources that we have, but where possible we should value add because when you value add you create jobs and economic activity there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The risks of climate change are here right now. This isn't some economic debate in an academic journal. Australians in recent times have experienced first drought then bushfires, flood and more flood. Australians have experienced the catastrophic consequences on human beings, families and communities. They've also experienced the economic costs of climate change, with whole towns destroyed by fire and with devastation by floods. Some parts of Sydney in the member for Macquarie's electorate have been impacted by bushfires and then three floods in a very short period of time. I don't know what it will take for those opposite to wake up and say: 'Yes, we were wrong. The science is clear. The science told us that there would be more extreme weather events and they would be more intense, and that is what is happening.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember when the bushfires were occurring here and government members and ministers were standing up saying, 'How dare you relate that to climate change?'—that that was being 'woke'. The people of regional Australia and the people impacted by those bushfires, whether they be in Gippsland, Eden-Monaro, the Blue Mountains or other communities on the North Coast of New South Wales, know the harsh reality of climate change. That's why we've seen a real transformation in the amount of support that is there for action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank those on the crossbenches who have been prepared to engage with us constructively on this legislation. They've been prepared to put forward their ideas within the parameters that we weren't about to change—our essential mandate that we had of 43 per cent by 2030. When you put in place the mechanisms that are there in the Powering Australia plan, you will see the market operating to drive that change through the economy and to drive those jobs through the economy. That will drive that change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also understand that we need to bring communities with us, to make sure, where there are changes in the nature of work in communities, that communities aren't left behind. We're determined to do that as well. That's why, when we signed the nationally determined contribution to the UNFCCC, the minister and I stood in front of the Business Council of Australia's secretary and president, the Australian Industry Group representing Australian manufacturers, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Clean Energy Council, the Australian Conservation Foundation and others, including Greenpeace and others who've come out in support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What you have is people not quietly but loudly screaming out for action, saying, 'Enough is enough.' We need to actually get on with the business of transition, of putting in place structures that will encourage that investment to occur. Because when that investment occurs, we know, from the modelling that we did through RepuTex, over 600,000 jobs will be created, and half a million of those will be in regional and rural Australia. We know the incredible opportunity there will be from the change that will happen in our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see it with innovative Australian businesses. We particularly see it in the regions. Projects like Sun Cable, which will be the world's largest solar farm, will use renewable energy. Those opposite are a bit obsessed by nuclear. Well this is the largest solar power plant. It's power's from up in the sky—and it's free! The Sun Cable project will use solar power to help power up to, and perhaps beyond, 20 per cent of Singapore's power needs. This is what we mean when we talk about being a renewable energy superpower, as Australia can actually export that energy. And, because it's renewable, because it's free, it's not finite. It's infinite what we can achieve in this century, whereby renewables will dominate the century as we go forward. That's why this is such an opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The market for batteries, for example, is only going to grow. We've already introduced our legislation to make electric vehicles cheaper. We have nickel, we have copper, we have lithium, we have everything that goes into a battery. Why aren't we making things here? There's not a solar panel in the world that doesn't have some intellectual innovation that was created here in Australia at UNSW or ANU just up the road. But we hardly make any of them here. If we actually open our eyes to the opportunities, we can transform this economy. We can create jobs. We can make such an enormous difference going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is as important a piece of legislation as will come before this parliament. It's a matter, as well, of our responsibility, and I say this to the young people out there: when you know that pollution is being created, you have a responsibility to act on it. Just as we don't accept people just putting their rubbish on the ground so someone else will pick it up, we have a responsibility to not say, 'We won't worry about emissions; we'll worry about future generations fixing it.' We have a great responsibility to this beautiful island continent that we live on to make sure we act on climate change. This government will. And then we can tell our children we stepped up, we took responsibility and we met the moment.</span>

It was a book about all of the worst disasters that had struck humankind since mankind first started walking on two legs. He referred to this book and he said: 'I want you to know that not one of these disasters has ever hit Australia. It's a book about all the deaths, all the tragedies and all the calamities that have occurred, and it doesn't mention Australia once.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have here <span style="font-style:italic;">Courage in Crisis</span>, a book published in 2011 that talks of the worst disasters in Australia's history. It talks of the 12,000-plus people who lost their lives in the 1918-19 influenza epidemic, which we heard much about during the COVID global pandemic; it talks of the 1,013 people who died in the 1946-55 polio epidemic which hit Australia; it talks of the 727 people who died in 1941 when HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Kormoran</span> had their famous battle in the Indian Ocean near Shark Bay; it talks of the 550 people who died nationwide between 1900 and 1910 from the bubonic plague; it talks of the 438 people who died between December 1938 and February 1939 from the heatwave that struck Victoria, and no-one mentioned climate change; it talks of the 437 people who died in the 1895-96 heatwave which struck south-eastern Australia; it talks of the 410 people who died on 4 March 1899 from Cyclone Mahina in Bathurst Bay in Queensland; and it talks of the 406 people who died in 1845 in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cataraqui</span> shipwreck off King Island in Tasmania.

But don't take my word for it; the renowned peer-reviewed journal <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lancet</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Planetary Health</span> says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was just at a book launch at which I heard General Patton's quote: 'If everyone is thinking alike, then someone isn't thinking.' That is so true. We talk of the climate wars, and again it is probably somewhat of an exaggeration to use the word 'wars' when we're talking about the national discussion about climate. It's not a war; a war is what is happening in Ukraine at the moment with Russia's invasion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's good to have a sensible, rational debate about action against climate change and what we're doing about it. I heard the Prime Minister in question time just today talk about the 604,000 jobs that will be created through the government's climate response. Five out of six, he claims, will be in regional Australia. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So many of those opposite are always talking about their people being concerned about what's being done about the climate, their people being concerned about what the future holds and their people being concerned about their children and grandchildren. I respect that—I do. But it is regional Australia that will bear the brunt of this if we get it wrong and if we push too hard too early. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister just mentioned this. Why aren't we manufacturing more? Indeed, I tend to think that the mining industry gets demonised when it comes to action on climate. We know BHP and a lot of the other big miners are taking action and taking it in their stride, but each and every one of us has one of these—a mobile phone—and the elements of mobile phones are rare earths obtained through mining. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all well and good to talk about wind farms and solar power. I have farming families at the moment who are desperately worried about converting prime agricultural land in and around Wagga Wagga to massive solar farms, foreign-owned solar farms. I talk to the Goodens, the Kirkpatricks, the Martins, the Killens, the Roaches and many others besides who are very worried about prime agricultural land being taken up by solar farms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The solar farms do not have to go through local government approval processes because they are considered state strategically important. They only have to be ticked off by the state government. Therefore, the local council—in this case Wagga Wagga City Council—doesn't even get a say. Yet these farming families—some of whom have been there for generations—are very concerned, not just about the appearance of these solar farms and what they will do to the landscape, but about taking away the food and fibre production of some of the best farming land you will find, not just in Australia but, indeed, in the world. They want a moratorium placed on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be very mindful and very careful about where we place our solar farms. But make no mistake, they will all be in regional Australia. I appreciate that the Prime Minister extols the virtue of what he is doing—and good on him for that. He is, after all, the Prime Minister. But there won't be any farms built in Marrickville or Newtown or anywhere in Grayndler—there will not be any solar farms. It will all be occurring in regional Australia. I appreciate too he and others, including the health minister, say that it is going to provide jobs and opportunities for Australians, but I do query the 600,000-plus number.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2021 Labor made a promise to cut power bills. We were approaching election time. We were all wondering when the election might or might not be called. Whilst Labor made this promise—they said that they would cut power bills whilst reducing emissions—these bills only legislate one of those targets. That promise to reduce household power bills by $275 by 2025 is the first broken promise of this government. It is a fallacy. They won't do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What will happen is that the Labor Party will be acquiescing to the Greens through this, and on other measures that will come forward as a result of this bill passing the House of Representatives and this bill passing the Senate—as it truly will. The Labor Party, the Albanese-Bandt government, will only legislate the emissions target and not the price target. Who pays? How do we get there? They're questions which people right throughout our nation are asking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of this government's first acts in office was to draw up a new nationally determined contribution, or NDC, the formal statement of Australia's commitment to the target under the Paris Agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know they went around, and so many candidates did, throughout the election campaign and absolutely demonised what we had done about emissions as a government over those nine years. We met and we beat all of our international targets. We absolutely met all of our obligations, but we did it in a responsible and practical way. We did it so that we didn't place the mining industry at risk. We did it in such a way that we didn't place our prime agricultural land at risk. We did it in such a way that power prices were coming down. We did it in such a way that jobs weren't being lost. We did it in such a way that people had a certainty about their futures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When former Prime Minister Scott Morrison went to Glasgow he had that net zero target by 2050, which was what had always been called for. Then it became net zero by 2035 and then net zero by 2030. Who knows what the future will hold when the member for Melbourne decides that he will tell the Prime Minister, 'We have got some new target now', and that is the rub. That is the big concern for regional Australians who, like me, doubt the 604,000 jobs that are supposedly going to be created. They do worry about wind farms and solar farms taking up prime agricultural land, and I appreciate exactly where they're coming from. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I'm glad to make some remarks in support of this legislation—the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. It is genuinely momentous legislation. It's a change that this country has been crying out for for a long time. I think all of us in the first half of this year, and particularly through the campaign, would have had a range of different experiences of where our communities were at and where our nation was at in terms of the challenges that we face and the way that the people we represent see those challenges. I'm always mindful, as a representative, of the interests of younger people. We must always remember the tendency for there to be intergenerational unfairness, and climate change is a great example of where, as the Prime Minister said before, there's a huge risk that communities and governments and decision-makers, as we are in this place, don't take our responsibility to do what's necessary and instead leave a completely unacceptable burden on young people and people, essentially, who will be citizens of this country in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, the standout moment in the first half of the year was during the campaign, when I went to Fremantle College—which used to be South Fremantle Senior High School when I was growing up—to talk to high school students in years 11 and 12, I think. I spoke to them about Australian democracy and how important it was and how they should feel it's their right and their entitlement to participate in how decisions are made. While I was explaining various things about how I represent a federal seat and the three levels of government and all of the other bits and pieces, there was a young woman to the left in the front of the crowd who caught my eye because she had her hand up like this. From the moment I was introduced to the stage she had her hand up, and she kept her hand up even though it was clear that I was going to be speaking for 10 minutes or so by way of introduction before we got to questions. I think a teacher at some point came over to her and said, 'Hey, listen: he's going to say a few things and then there'll be time for questions.' She kept a hand up. The teacher came over and she put her hand down temporarily, and then the teacher went away and she put her hand up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was clear to me that she was in distress, and as soon as I finished speaking, which I tried to do pretty quickly, hers was the first question. Her question was: 'How can it be that—when we know the science, when we've experienced the bushfires, when we know that the last eight years have been the hottest years on the planet on record and when Australia experienced a bushfire event that included the largest bushfire in our history and we saw three billion animals killed and 19 million hectares torched—you as a representative and all the people that you're with and the institution that you're a part of have done nothing? How can that be the case?' She was angry. She was distressed. She was insistent. It was kind of a question and a statement mixed in together. The teachers, I think, were very supportive of her. At some point they kind of encouraged her to wrap it up. She went on for several minutes, and she was so passionate and insistent and disappointed at what was going on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That really stuck with me because, when you work in this place and you have the privilege of being part of decision-making, you can start to be a bit desensitised to what it's actually like for people who are watching what we do with great expectation for how we should respond to things that are obvious and be prepared to consider things that are necessary. So I say to that young woman and to young people in Australia: you're right to be disappointed and frustrated and distressed. You're right to look with a huge amount of dismay at the way national government has conducted itself in this country, particularly over the last 10 years, because it's been appalling. I say that to young people in my part of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of the focus during the bushfires was, of course, on the terrible inferno on the east coast. We had similar events in Western Australia that were, I guess, not as noteworthy from a media point of view because they didn't involve loss of homes and lives, but they did involve 35 per cent of the Stirling Range National Park being burnt to the ground over 2019-20. We had, in the most recent summer, the hottest summer on record in Western Australia. The average daily temperature was a full degree hotter than it has ever been before. In previous summers, the record for days over 40 degrees was seven. This recent summer we had 13. We had six days of over 40 degrees in a row. We had more days over 35 than we have ever experienced before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people know what's happening. They are clued in to the science in Australia and the science internationally. They have watched what's happened in this place under the previous government with justifiable dismay, distress and rage because what they have essentially seen is their future being utterly ignored and their wellbeing and the wellbeing of biodiversity in Australia, for which we're all responsible, being utterly ignored. This government isn't going to allow that to stand. This government, in passing this legislation, is doing some quite different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to young people: your feelings of anger, distress, disappointment and disbelief are all utterly justified. But look at what is happening in this country now. Look what those of you who voted in the recent election have been able to bring about in terms of change. Look at what has occurred in the first few months of this government already. Unlike when the previous government went to Glasgow, where the expectation was countries would come with greater ambition and the last government could barely be bothered to take a glossy pamphlet and didn't shift what was already an inadequate nationally determined contribution of 26 to 28 per cent one iota, one of the first acts of the Albanese Labor government was to significantly shift that dial to commit to 43 per cent, which Professor Mark Howden, the director of the Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions at the ANU and a vice-chair of the IPCC, has said is entirely consistent with the obligations set out at Glasgow and entirely consistent with Australia's obligations and intentions to get to net zero by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that 43 per cent is not the end of the story; 43 per cent is the beginning. So are all the other changes that we're making. We're restoring the Climate Change Authority so that we can have proper transparency and accountability, ensuring that there will be an annual statement of ministerial responsibility. I think those who claim that passing this legislation is unnecessary and only symbolic miss a pretty big point. While there is a prerogative of the executive to go and make treaty commitments, it is right that we as parliamentarians, as the representatives of the people, get to have our say. It is entirely up to everyone in this House to vote on these bills, and then it will be the same for those in the other place. That endorsement by the parliament is a powerful thing in terms of certainty and clarity but also democratic integrity. It means that the representatives of the people in Australia are endorsing that commitment and are essentially calling on the government, the responsible ministers, to deliver on those commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The change that we are making with this legislation has been a long time coming and it represents a belated important step on a path that has been neglected for a long time. It is utterly necessary for our broad health and wellbeing—our human health and our environmental health. It is utterly necessary in terms of our leadership as a middle-power country, the 13th-largest economy in the world, a nation that has among the highest per capita emissions in the world. It's absolutely our responsibility to reflect those facts with our actions in our own interests and in keeping with the leadership that Australia has traditionally shown, which has been sadly lacking over the last 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to these changes because they are necessary, despite the fear mongering that we will unfortunately continue to hear in this debate. This is not a balanced thing between imposts on the one hand and benefits on the other. The benefits run in both directions. There are enormous economic benefits, job benefits and pollution-reduction benefits as well as climate benefits. So I support this bill wholeheartedly, and I thank the young people of Australia for their patience.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="008CH" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  I rise today to speak to the Climate Change Bill 2022 as the representative of my community of Goldstein. I'm aware that some members of the Goldstein community will be disappointed with the legislated target of 43 per cent carbon emissions reduction by 2030. I agree with you. We need to do better than that. The science says we should be hitting higher targets. I went to the election believing, based on scientific modelling and evidence, that 60 per cent is a realistic target within that time frame. My position has not changed. But there is will that is in the majority in this place, and certainly that will far exceeds the stalling of the last decade, which saw our nation go to COP26 with a grossly inadequate target of 26 to 28 per cent. It was a target which did not take responsibility for our environment, our industries and businesses, our regional communities and their deserved just transition, or the future of our children. As parliamentarians and as leaders, we do have a duty of care to our communities on climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, progress needs to be stepped through, and this bill has yielded a collaborative process between government and the crossbench that I believe reflects the kind of approach to politics that Goldstein voted me in here to help provide. I commend the work of the member for Warringah, whose tireless work on climate helped bring about the climate election. Finally our communities have spoken. I appreciate the work and intent of the climate change minister and the willingness from his office to engage with me and other members of the crossbench to improve this important legislation. The Goldstein community made it abundantly clear that they wanted politics done differently. The government, for the moment, appears to have gotten the message. So far, so good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of conversations with the minister about this bill, I and others on the crossbench have advocated strongly for 43 per cent to be explicitly noted as a floor, not a ceiling, when it comes to carbon emissions. This plain language is necessary, I believe, to prevent ambition from being thwarted—to make sure that there are no unintended consequences of this law that limit our future capacity to be brave and innovative and to lead on climate policy. Science and the best available scientific knowledge must underpin everything that we do from now on. This is the time for consistency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a person who grew up in regional Australia—much as I now live in and love Goldstein—first in Tasmania and having since lived and worked in Lismore and along the coast of New South Wales, as well as in Darwin, I pay heed to the apprehension in communities outside the big cities. Their experience when they've seen changes made to policy for environmental reasons has often created negative community impact. We must do better in ensuring that regional communities reap the benefits of the transformation from our dependence on fossil fuels to leading on clean, green technology. It's not about transition; it's about transformation. The backdrop is the physical impact of climate change on communities who are now bearing the brunt of floods, fires and droughts. Risk management and planning must be a priority area as we step through this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have liked the minister to agree to amend the legislation to insert a new clause to make it crystal-clear that the 2030 target does not constrain even greater emissions reductions. This is a change which would give the final legislation, I think, greater legal force. But I am pleased that he's indicated that he is prepared to make it clear that the legislation doesn't limit Australia's ability to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions beyond 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Half a loaf is better than none. But rest assured I will keep pressing the government for more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, the government should next commit to establishing in legislation emissions budgets for each emissions budget period beyond 2030—that is, 2031 to 2035, 2036 to 2040, 2041 to 2045 and 2046 to 2050. The government should also commit to inserting a climate trigger into the EPBC Act to ensure that proposed fossil fuel developments cannot undermine the pathway to net zero, efficiently, equitably and rapidly. The <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the environment</span> report released by the environment minister a week or so ago paints a shocking picture of the degradation of our flora and fauna—just shocking. We must make up for lost time if our children, and theirs, are going to enjoy the natural bounty of this nation and if we are to remain a continent of wonder or, as I used to tell my children when we were living overseas, 'the magical land of Oz'. I call on the government to reveal when it intends to publish the planned and staged emissions budget for 2021 to 2030 that it's committed to in this climate bill. How exactly will we hit and exceed that mark? I also call on the government not to again politicise this debate and reignite the climate wars by tying budgets beyond 2030 to election campaigns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken previously in this chamber about my direct experience in the aftermath of climate related disasters. In 2011, I spent several months covering what were described as one-in-1,000-year floods in Thailand. Almost 14 million people were affected in 65 of Thailand's 76 provinces, across 20,000 square kilometres. Central Bangkok was under serious threat, and, as the creeping disaster dragged on and the Mekong and Chao Phraya river basins overflowed, the government closed the city's floodgates. When the city closed the floodgates to protect the high-rises, shopping centres and apartment blocks of the CBD from the rising waters, the CBD khlongs, or canals, were empty. But, outside those floodgates, water that couldn't flow away inundated communities for months. People attacked the floodgates, trying to open them, to no avail. Central Bangkok was spared, but the largely poorer residents on the outskirts were not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the communities we had visited on the flooded side of the barriers invited us to a funeral. A small child, a boy, had woken up from his afternoon nap. The toddler stepped out of his home and into the flood. His was one death of several hundred during those one-in-1,000-year floods, which, as we know all too well in Australia and elsewhere, happen a lot more often than every thousand or even every hundred years. We must not allow ourselves to get used to this. We cannot get used to the death, destruction and ongoing trauma that is ever more frequently happening because of climate change. We were warned, and we have been too slow. This little boy was a victim of that, as are the residents of South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales, especially in my old home town of Lismore, and those affected by repeated bushfires across our fragile and beautiful nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a minimum number to provide certainty for business and community. Further consistent government policy must follow to ensure that we exceed that number and become the leaders that we can be. Let's get on with it. If not us, who? If not now, when? I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  When I asked the people of Wills to give me the privilege of being re-elected as part of an Albanese Labor government, I made it clear that I was committed to taking real action in government and getting things done. That's what we would do if we won government: real action on the cost of living, real action on secure local jobs and, of course, real action on tackling climate change. I campaigned on the fact that an Albanese Labor government was committed to taking that real action by implementing our policies and legislation to lower our emissions, create thousands of clean energy jobs and decrease household bills with massive investments in renewable technology to make us a renewable energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During this first sitting of the 47th Parliament, we are making our commitment to real action clear and manifest with the introduction of the first genuine climate action legislation after more than a decade of inaction. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy nailed it in question time when he said, 'A decade of inaction is over.' There are a lot of platitudes in politics, and the conversation about climate action is not immune to that—that's for sure. Those on the other side like to promote a false, rather damaging dichotomy that it's either the environment or the economy, as if you've got to choose. There are also those from the minor parties and those on the fringes who think we can wave a magic wand to deal with climate change, without a genuine plan for workers and the communities that they support around Australia. The country has been crying out for sensible and real action in this space for a decade. We are delivering it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of the Climate Change Bill 2022 because it's the first real climate change bill in a decade. We've had nine years—almost 10 years—of wasted opportunities and those opposite dithering and in denial, delivering 22 so-called energy policies, all of which were abandoned when they started fighting each other in their own party room and could never agree on one of them. It was a disaster, and the Australian people had enough of it. They had enough of the dithering, enough of the denial. They just had enough of it. They wanted things to get done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians trust that we will get this right because Labor has a strong track record of environmental policy, and we have the commitments to prove it. Let's not forget that it was the Whitlam government that was able to prevent Joh Bjelke-Petersen from drilling in the Great Barrier Reef. It was the Hawke government that was able to save the Franklin River, Kakadu National Park and the Daintree Rainforest. It was the Keating government that worked to protect our oceans. But we don't need to look at the past anymore, because it will be this Albanese Labor government that will be remembered for taking real action on climate change and protecting our environment for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment is backed up by a fully modelled and costed plan, Powering Australia. It's a plan to reduce emissions by at least 43 per cent by 2030, joining our international partners like Japan, South Korea and Canada in that ambition. It's a plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, bringing us into line with countries like France, Denmark and Spain, which have similarly legislated targets. It's a plan that reflects Australia's commitment to the Paris Agreement and the efforts to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees on pre-industrial levels. Rejoining our international partners in this effort is not just important in doing our fair share to reduce emissions; it is critical to our long-term bilateral relationships, our engagement with our partners across the globe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Already, under the leadership of Prime Minister Albanese, this government has made significant strides in repairing relationships that were damaged by Australia's lack of leadership in the previous government. No longer are we the subject of ire from our international partners, who expect us to do our fair share. This is a principle, the fair share, which is somewhat similar to the fair go. It's a principle that Australians easily understand. Do your bit. Put your fair share in. Make the effort. We're no longer speaking to empty rooms at international conferences; we're actually bidding to host them. We're no longer leaving our Pacific neighbours, our friends and partners in the Pacific, on their own as they experience the devastating impacts of climate change, the existential threat they face. We're with them now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will not be limited in our ambition. As the Prime Minister has said, our target is a floor, not a ceiling. We will become a renewable energy superpower with the investment that will be unleashed by our policies and our legislation. We will be accountable, unlike the previous government, when it comes to this action. This will take the form of an annual climate change statement to parliament, ensuring accountability on meeting our targets, including progress made in achieving those, international developments relevant to addressing climate change and the effectiveness of the government's policies in meeting the set targets. This statement will be informed by the independent Climate Change Authority, which will also be tasked with providing ongoing advice on adjusting future targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a plan to create hundreds of thousands of secure, well-paid jobs. This is important because it's not just about words or a so-called just transition with nothing really to back it up. Our plan is to lower power bills for ordinary Australians, to help more Australians join the solar revolution by installing 400 solar community batteries around the country, and to connect 100,000 Australian householders who may not be able to install solar, like apartment owners and renters, so they can draw from excess electricity stored in batteries. This will allow more Australians to take full advantage of cheap solar energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the people of Wills, my electorate—and it's interesting that most of my colleagues on this side hear the same thing when they talk to their constituents—tell me they feel a real sense of relief that they finally have a government that is actually doing something in the national interest. It's as if a weight has been lifted off their shoulders. That's a widespread view. It's nationwide. We have a federal government that actually cares about this country's future and future generations and is committed to taking real action here in this place and in our governance. It has brought together all sectors of civil society: the unions, the business sector and environmental groups. All of them joined our minister when he formally signed our new targets in June this year. So I congratulate the Minister for Climate Change and Energy for his efforts to develop legislation that recognises the significance of this challenge while bringing the different elements of Australian society together, including here in this parliament. I thank the members of the crossbench, who have sought to negotiate in good faith, and I call on those yet to declare their support to consider the bigger picture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also call on members of the opposition—the handful that are here—who are still opposing this legislation to reconsider, because we have a unique opportunity to end a decade of fighting, denial and delay. We have a unique opportunity to chart a new path forward. We have a unique opportunity to do something inherently good—something significant—for the people we represent and for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On election day, Australians voted to end the climate wars; they had had enough. Our Prime Minister spoke eloquently of the possibility of a better future and the potential of a better future, and now this parliament can do the same. We can vote to end the decade of delay and denial. We can vote to mark the end of our climate delinquency. We can vote for our children and our grandchildren to have that better future. We can vote for real action.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  Let me say from the outset that a reduction of 43 per cent of CO2 emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels is an admirable target. It is a good target. It may be ambitious but it is an admirable target. It has already been adopted by the government and they have submitted it to the UN, the Prime Minister said. But legislating the 43 per cent—through the Climate Change Bill and the associated amendment bill—is a different thing and it is a bad idea. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy has said they don't need to, so why would they do it and why is it a bad idea?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Targets have been tremendously successful for Australia. Kyoto 1 and 2 were both reached and exceeded. We will exceed our Paris target, which was 26 to 28 per cent, easily—in fact, probably reaching around 35 per cent under current projections without new policies coming from the government. We have done so much better than many others without smashing our economy and by adapting day by day to the delivery and development of new technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take umbrage with the members opposite making allegations that the previous government was doing nothing. We reduced emissions by 23 per cent on 2005 levels, one of only a handful of 193 countries around the world that could claim that. I am sure you are familiar with it, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas. In Grey alone there are over 2,000 megawatts of installed capacity of either solar or wind, and there are more than 1,000 megawatts planned or under construction under the previous government's policy. Australia has the highest penetration of rooftop solar on the planet and it is adding large-scale wind and solar at a per capita at twice the rate of the next fastest country. In Grey, as we have in the rest of South Australia, we have reached almost 40 per cent of premises with rooftop solar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is a very important point: we need to have some comparisons and an idea of what the rest of the world is doing. China has promised to slash, by 2030, 65 per cent of CO2 emissions per unit of GDP. Perhaps it will do that. Good luck with that, I might say, because China has already increased its GDP by more than 200 per cent since 2005, and if it keeps growing at the projected rate through to 2030, its GDP will be 450 per cent bigger than it was in 2005. So making a commitment to reductions based on per capita GDP needs to be measured up with the increase in the GDP over the same period. Extrapolating the 65 per cent cut, that still allows for a 60 per cent increase on their real 2005 levels. Well, good luck with that, because in 2005 they emitted five billion tonnes per annum. By 2021 they'd already more than doubled that, to 11.7 billion tonnes. They say they're only going to go up by 60 per cent, but they've already gone up by over 100 per cent and are increasing emissions by more than half a billion tonnes a year. Australia only emits half a billion tonnes a year, and China is increasing by that much each year. In fact, China has already gone three billion tonnes a year past their commitment for their 2030 target. On that note, China had 90 gigawatts of new coal-fired generation capacity under construction last year, which was about the same as the year before. If anyone needs a comparison, Loy Yang is rated at 1.2 gigawatts and the much-noted Liddell Power Station at 1.7 gigawatts. China is building 90 gigawatts a year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Historians argue over whether it was Churchill, John Maynard Keynes or someone else who first said, 'When the facts change, sir, I change my mind. What do you do?' The question here is: what if the circumstances change over the next five years or so, and we're locked into legislation? What if in five years we find the 22,000-strong entourage that trooped off to COP26 in Glasgow last year spoke with a collective forked tongue, or China and India continue merrily along, or if European nations keep bringing their fossil fuel power stations out of retirement, or even building new ones? And what if in five years time Australia is losing aluminium production, or losing steel production in Whyalla, in your home state, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas? What if food manufacturing and fertiliser manufacturing are being undercut by those around the world who choose not to reduce their CO2 emissions? What then, when we have a legislated 43 per cent? When we have the legislated target, it will be used by activists to block the progress of new projects in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scientific facts may not have changed, but the political and economic ones will have. What of a bid to build a world-class fertiliser plant in Australia if an activist chooses to block its progress, in the courts, on the basis of the legislation? We'll have a situation where the High Court will effectively have power to block government projects or the preferences of government via use of the government legislation. And I'm indebted to the shadow minister for climate change and energy for bringing forward that exact example of these circumstances in the UK. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude that legislating this target is no more than a bit of political grandstanding, a bit of politics within the warm inner glow. The minister has said that the government does not need to legislate, so why would we risk stranding Australia, like a shag on a rock, while the world changes around us? By all means let us strive for the 43 per cent—let's go further—but only on the basis that we are not that shag on the rock, that we do not rush ahead of the evolving technologies before they are mature enough to give us low-cost transmission that will protect our jobs, our economy and our place in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of issues I've brought up in this place before, and one that nags me is the international accounting methods for carbon emissions. These are designed by European nations for European nations. There's no other way to describe it. Nations that import the bulk of their energy actually shift their emissions onto third countries. Take the case of uranium—a lot of it is mined in our home state, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas. The emissions that are generated in the mining and refining of that uranium, through to yellowcake standard, and its transport—normally diesel but also electricity, and it's all generated in Australia—go on Australia's debit sheet. In fact, we are supplying clean fuel to the rest of the world so that they can claim a net benefit. It's gone on our debit sheet, but we didn't use the energy!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example is our gas industry, where we provide a relatively clean fuel to much of the world and to many mature markets. The fact that 30 per cent of the energy of the gas is used in compression within Australia goes on our debit sheet. Another country can put their hand up and say: 'Look how clean we are. We're using gas, and it's hardly got any'—by comparison—'emissions, because the emissions have actually been emitted by Australia on behalf of another country.' That is a corrupt system. It should operate like a GST, where the consumer actually lists where the CO2, right through the chain, is passed on to the consumer. Unless we get a system like that, it is corrupt from top to bottom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear members on the other side telling us that Australia has the highest per capita emissions in the world, but if we took out the products that we supply to the rest of the world that actually lessen their emissions then we would not be in that position. I don't know exactly where on the graph we would sit, but I know we would not be the highest. And so as long as that system is allowed to continue, decisions will be made based on the wrong information—not the wrong information necessarily for our particular country but the wrong information for the world. One of the things we do know about CO2 emissions and global warming is that it is a worldwide problem that can only have a worldwide solution.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When campaigning in my electorate of Boothby there was no issue raised with me more frequently or more passionately than climate change, specifically the previous government's: complete failure to provide the certainty and stability that groups across the community, from businesses to the unions to environmental groups, have long called for; failure to grasp the enormous opportunities that the world's transition to renewable energy presents for our country; and failure to end the climate wars, politicising one of the major challenges of our time. That's what this legislation is designed to do.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is only the beginning, the first step for us in implementing the Powering Australia plan that we took to the Australian people at the May election. These bills set in law our emission reduction ambitions and represent a solid, reliable and dependable foundation from which to build further efforts to reduce our carbon emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Bill 2022 legislates the 2030 and 2050 targets, consistent with the nationally determined contribution that the Albanese government signed on 16 June. Importantly—and this concept may be foreign to those opposite—it enhances accountability by making the government of the day accountable to the people through an annual statement to parliament. This statement will include an update on the progress made during the year towards achieving targets, an update on international developments, changes to climate change policy and a review of the effectiveness of the Commonwealth climate change policies in contributing to the achievements of the targets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill boosts transparency by requiring independent advice to be part of the annual statements and future targets, and it is independent advice from those who really know what they're talking about—the Climate Change Authority. It requires this Climate Change Authority advice to be public and, crucially, obliges the minister to take into account the advice and formally respond to that advice, because accountability to the people of Australia is an important principle. This report will not be hidden away like so many we saw—or, rather, did not see—under the previous government. We will be accountable.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides for a regular independent review of the act. It also ensures Australia keeps setting future targets that meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement to be a progression on our current commitments. This means our target is effectively a floor, not a ceiling, when it comes to reducing emissions—something I know the people of Boothby are passionate about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second bill is the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022, and this inserts our targets into the objectives and functions of a range of Commonwealth agencies and schemes. This includes amending the objectives of the legislation establishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, to help focus those agencies on contributing to the targets; requiring the targets to be taken into account by Export Finance Australia and Infrastructure Australia for a number of their functions; recognising CSIRO's contribution to all elements of the Paris Agreement and its legislative functions; updating climate laws to reference both the targets and the Paris Agreement so that policies such as carbon crediting and the safeguard mechanism help deliver on those targets; and updating the Climate Change Authority legislation to reference the purposes of the Paris Agreement in the principles it considers when providing advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2030 and 2050 targets are reflected in Australia's updated nationally determined contribution, submitted under the Paris Agreement, to the UNFCCC. The 27th conference of that agency is scheduled for November 2022, and passage of these bills before that conference will reinforce Australia's ability to influence global efforts to address climate change. We will no longer be embarrassed internationally, no longer be laggards, as we were under the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lack of climate change action by the former government is one of the major reasons I decided to run in Boothby. As a mother of three young adults and watching the former government—those opposite—put ideology over evidence and waste close to a decade pulling Australia backwards on climate, I knew I had to act. I spent almost 10 months talking to voters in every single part of this very diverse electorate, and I heard very clearly from the people in Boothby that they care about taking action on climate change, for just about every reason imaginable. Ignore the message sent by the Australian people at your peril.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For some in Boothby, particularly those in the Adelaide foothills, in Blackwood and Belair, the threat of climate change is obvious—more intense and more frequent heatwaves and bushfires that already threaten their homes. On the flats, at Mitchell Park, Marion and Edwardstown, action on climate change can mean economic opportunities. These once dominant manufacturing areas are ripe for the investment of a green energy revolution to ensure the wealth of our nation and of Boothby is distributed more fairly. In Mitcham I heard about the fears of flooding. A one-in-100-year flooding event seems a lot more real after you've seen it happen four times in a few months in the eastern states. For those on the coast, in Glenelg, Somerton, Brighton and Seacliff, climate change threatens what are some of Australia's very best coastlines and beaches, and their homes, through sea level rise and the impact of stronger storms. Across the electorate, people told me of their fears for themselves and, particularly, for the next generations—the legacy they would be leaving their children and grandchildren. I've listened to them all, and now this government is taking action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the important work done by conservation and environmental groups in my electorate. Doctors for the Environment talked to me about the public health emergency that climate change represents: heatwaves causing deaths and infectious diseases. The Australian Conservation Foundation talked to me about the environment in crisis, and we heard more about that from the Minister for the Environment and Water earlier this week, about the impact the changing environment has on biodiversity and the impact that has on us and our lives. Parents for Climate Action and Eco Walk 'n' Roll groups told me about our responsibility to the next generation to leave them an environment they can live in, to mitigate the extremes of temperature and the increasingly extreme weather events. The Uniting Church climate change group talked to me about our responsibility to those less well-off—people who can't afford to keep the air conditioner running all summer and the heater running all winter and can't afford for food prices to go up when crops fail, be it here in Australia or in other countries. And I lost count of the number of individual people who told me they couldn't stand to see the opportunities of a clean, renewable energy economy going elsewhere, when Australia has such an abundance of resources and talent to harness them here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses talked to me about the opportunities that climate change action can offer to South Australia. They spoke of plans for green aluminium. They spoke of green steel. They spoke of thousands of jobs and major industry in the regions. They spoke of advanced manufacturing in Australia and of export markets for value-added products made in Australia, all predicated on abundant renewable energy and storage—solar, wind and storage, including hydrogen, based in the regions, powering Australia's next economic revolution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I visit Tonsley in my electorate and I speak to the businesses there—we have the largest hydrogen electrolyser in the Southern Hemisphere; we have industries working in the energy sector, servicing electric vehicles and batteries and developing smart technology—I know that industry is ready for this change. They see the opportunities, and we know that if we do not harness these opportunities they will simply go elsewhere. I want these opportunities for the people of Boothby and, more broadly, South Australia and Australia. We simply no longer have any time to waste. We certainly can no longer stick our heads in the sand on this issue; we need action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the minister said in introducing these bills, 2030 is only 89 months away—less than 7½ short years. These bills represent the start of a new chapter in our politics where we tackle this long-vexed issue by enshrining in law a sensible, achievable but still ambitious emissions reduction target. These bills make clear that this government is taking climate action seriously. We are taking the challenge of governing seriously. We are taking the Paris climate agreement and our international obligations seriously. We are taking net zero by 2050 and the 2030 target seriously. We are taking accountability and responsibility seriously. This is a government determined to grasp the enormous opportunities of a green energy future for Australia. We have a new government.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  This is a historic day for our country. I'm honoured to have an opportunity to speak on this bill, the Climate Change Bill 2022, which resets the tone of our national approach to climate change. I was elected by the community of Kooyong to work for urgent and effective action on climate change. I thank the Minister for Climate Change and Energy for recognising the urgency of this matter and for bringing this legislation to parliament so early in this term. I also thank the minister for the opportunity afforded the crossbench in recent weeks to work constructively and collaboratively on this bill with this government, although I note that the government's haste has necessarily curtailed the ability of non-government members to improve some aspects of this legislation. We on the crossbench have worked hard, and we've secured some improvements to this bill. We will continue to work hard, such that this is just the first of many bills to mitigate global warming and transition to clean energy that will be passed by this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former federal government spent close to a decade faffing around, arguing amongst themselves, bringing lumps of coal into this chamber and pretending that the earth wasn't getting hotter. Precious time was wasted. We can no longer beat around the bush here. We are in a climate emergency. I stand here today, one of many people sounding the alarm. Federal legislation is fundamental to establishing clear direction towards net zero by 2050 and better ways of measuring our progress, and to locking in the gains that we make towards that goal. The ideal legislation should also set interim goals to ensure that we act now—goals which should be transparent, responsive and progressive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is limited in detail on its targets, on how they are to be achieved and on the consequences to this government should those targets not be achieved, because, of course, there will be grave consequences should the targets not be achieved. One does not need to be a political scientist to see that the increasing severity and frequency of fires and extreme weather events is affecting all in this country. We have seen the collapse of entire ecosystems and the risk to our food, our water and our air. These have not been consequential enough for the major parties in recent years but are affecting all of us every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over time, we must act to increase the ambition and scope of the targets in this bill. We must not deny, dissemble, delay, procrastinate or pretend. Every tonne of emissions produced now, pumped into our shared and collective atmosphere, makes the job harder for us and for the next generation. Every tonne of carbon dioxide we produce now will stay with us. Every tonne of methane we produce now will stay with us. We all share the earth's atmosphere and we have to humble ourselves to the fact that all of us need clean air. We must secure a more ambitious emissions reduction target to meet our international obligations, to signal this country's commitment to a global effort to act on climate change. That will enable all of us to hold our heads high on the world stage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Kooyong made history in May. For the first time since Federation they sent a representative to parliament to fight for climate action on their behalf. Many have contacted me about this bill and its 2030 target of 43 per cent, asking, 'Is it enough?' It's not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the science. We know that in order to keep the rise in atmospheric temperature to just 1.5 degrees we have to reduce our carbon emissions by at least 60 per cent, ideally by more than 75 per cent. We know that that means that Australia cannot open new coalmines or gas projects. We know that a more ambitious target will free our economy from its reliance on 20th-century energy sources and from the instability of increasingly volatile international markets and precarious international security. We know that our federal government, even now, is out of step with our international partners in the Group of Seven nations, who have committed to halving emissions by 203; major corporate bodies, such as the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia; as well as the various state governments, who have been well ahead of the government in the targets that they have set. Most importantly, we do know how to achieve a more ambitious emissions reduction target. We must transition our energy supply to renewables, build a cleaner, more efficient electricity network, increase availability and decrease the cost of low-emissions vehicles, support domestic manufacturing of heavy vehicles and community transport, invest in new technologies and battery manufacturing, and improve the efficiency of both existing and new Australian homes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect, I disagree with the Prime Minister's contention that opening new gas and coal mines would not add to the world's use of fossil fuels. This is an antiquated theory from the last century, before the historic Paris Agreement, and no longer holds water. Opening new coal and gas mines in Australia will add to the world's use of fossil fuels, and it will kneecap our ability to mitigate climate catastrophe. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's inevitable that any additional supply of gas and coal will delay the world's transition to renewables. We've seen extraordinary progress in our transition to renewable energy in recent years. We can continue to build on that without taking backward steps, without building assets destined to be stranded as our international trading partners make their own progress towards net zero emissions. Australia's actions count globally. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So is this bill enough? Today I will focus on the urgency of our need to act. Pragmatically I will say that today it's enough; I will support this bill. But tomorrow, without pause, our work will continue. I urge the government to remain open to working with other members of this parliament to build collaboratively on this foundation, to work with us to exceed expectations and to surpass this target. Working together, we can be a parliament that actually listens to the voices of its voters. We can be a parliament that exceeds expectations.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  According to the most credible science available, and that includes our own CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology here in Australia, the earth's climate is changing. The changes are in addition to the normal cycle of climatic changes that have occurred over the decades and the centuries and which are noted in public records. The most notable climate changes are a result of global warming, which in turn causes or leads to more frequent and more severe weather events, destruction of environmental assets, the loss of flora and fauna, threats to human health and changes in weather and rainfall patterns. These consequences are already with us, adding to our daily cost of living and risking a sustainable and stable lifestyle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that not all people accept all of the facts, conclusions and forecasts associated with climate change. I also acknowledge that some people accept that climate change is real but do not accept the causes, the proposed solutions or Australia's ability to make a meaningful difference to climate change throughout the world. I am also acutely aware that vested interests, including the fossil fuel companies and the renewable energy investors, have entered the climate change debate and, in doing so, have added to public confusion and political disunity—disunity which has resulted in a decade of inaction on what many would agree is a pressing issue facing humanity where the global response has become a race against time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changing the way societies function—particularly in advanced countries, which are generally the higher per-capita emitters of greenhouse gases—will require lifestyle changes and time to adjust. However, the longer the changes are delayed, the more severe and more disruptive the impact on society will be when the necessary action is taken, and even more profound will be the impact on society if no action is taken. Climate scientists know that, industry leaders know that and most international political leaders know that, and in response they have all committed to substantial policy changes and investments in mitigation strategies. That is what the Australian people want the Australian government to do. They expect a measured but meaningful response from this government. Public polling shows that. The May election confirmed that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Neither households nor businesses can continue to function in a climate of uncertainty. Personal and business investments will only be made when there is long-term stability and predictability. That is what this legislation—the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022—seeks to do. It will begin a responsible transition to a lower-emissions economy that will generate investments in new technology and in new jobs. It will be less destructive to our natural environment and contribute to global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that under the Morrison government not only was Australia being left behind on climate change responses when compared with other advanced countries but even within Australia the Morrison government was being left behind by the state and territory governments. I have heard other members, particularly opposition members, come into this place and talk about how Australia was achieving the 26 to 28 per cent targets that the Morrison government had set. I say to those members that most of those targets were achieved because of the actions of state governments, not because of the actions of the federal government that was led by Prime Minister Morrison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For some people a 43 per cent reduction target by 2030 on 2005 levels is too low—and we've heard other speakers talking about that. Others have, in fact, claimed that it will be too high and it will cause too much disruption to society and therefore it should be opposed. The fact that we have people on both sides of that argument—one group saying it's too high and the other saying it's too low—tells me that we have probably got it about right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at the comparison with other countries in terms of what they are doing—and I am referring specifically to other advanced economies—there is a strong similarity between the target that this government is now setting and those being set elsewhere. Whilst there might be some differences, I don't believe the differences are sufficient to warrant any concern about that, particularly when we have said very clearly that the 43 per cent is a floor, not a ceiling. Indeed, if a higher reduction can be achieved, and achieved responsibly, I suspect it will be. It is my view that, if this legislation is passed, it will send a very clear signal to the economy and that the transition to a lower-carbon economy will in fact pick up pace when everybody has a very clear direction in which to follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to all of that, the government has made it clear that there will be, each year, a report to parliament with respect to the emission reductions that have been achieved. That report to parliament will serve as an accountability mechanism, for the Australian public to judge whether the government is in fact committed to and achieving the targets it has set. It is a requirement of this legislation for that report to come to the parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation also strengthens and articulates the roles of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Climate Change Authority and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, all of which were white-anted by the last coalition government, because they were not committed to climate change action and needed to silence their critics. The Morrison government did all they could to disempower the very structures that Labor had established over a decade ago to provide advice and guide us through the climate change transition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has always been Labor that has initiated and ultimately delivered major national reforms. It has been Labor that has always led Australia's climate change response and pursued a carbon pollution reduction policy, sometimes in the face of opposition from both the coalition and even the Greens. Labor will deliver on this legislation, and the 43 per cent target, because the target is what will drive investment, drive changes in community attitudes and drive investment in new technology. All of that opens the way for additional businesses and jobs, as we've heard time and time again with respect to the policy that we are now introducing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No country acting alone will reverse or contain the climate change trajectory. That requires a global effort, in which all countries must make a contribution—some greater, some lesser—and each country will do what it can given the capacity it has. Australia has the capacity both to contribute towards a lower-emissions society and to contribute to new low-emissions technologies. As a responsible global nation, we should do both. If we don't, we cannot expect other nations to carry us. If the world does not act, the devastation and extreme weather events—including the loss of lives, the financial costs of those events, the health costs from living in a polluted environment and the environmental destruction—will vastly outweigh the costs and disruption of climate change action, which many opposite seem to oppose. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation must be passed by both this House and the Senate if Australia is to look to the future with confidence that a clear climate change direction has been set. The coalition have stated their opposition to this legislation. I believe that, in doing so, they have failed to respect the views of the majority of Australians and, perhaps, have even lost the respect of many within the international community. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I say this. I came into this place—and the member for Blair sits in front of me—in 2007, with acting on climate change being one of the priorities of the Rudd government at the time. We were obstructed from doing so by the opposition and the Greens. Fifteen years later, it is an Albanese Labor government that puts this matter on the agenda once again and makes it a priority for government, because that is what the Australian people expect us to do. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  The <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment</span> report, finally made public last month, confirms what scientists, experts and communities from around the country have been trying to tell this parliament for years: that the climate crisis isn't some esoteric mumbo jumbo or a far-off threat to be confronted in the future—a policy problem to be kicked down the road—but rather an increasingly all-consuming reality that is already tearing the very fabric of our environment, society and economy. Remember, climate change has already been felt brutally by the communities who experienced the terrifying Black Summer bushfires in 2019-2020 or the recent flooding down the east coast of the mainland. Moreover, we see the evidence in the bleached northern corals and in our dying kelp forests well down south. Indeed, extreme events like storms, floods, heatwaves, droughts and wildfires have affected every part of Australia in recent years, hence 19 of Australia's critical ecosystems have collapsed or are in the process of collapsing. We're already the home of the first mammalian extinction due to human induced climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't waste any more time, because, quite simply, we don't have any more time. So I do welcome this bill, and I do support the government's move to enshrine our emissions targets in legislation, not least to provide certainty to businesses but also to shore up commitments made on the international stage. Yes, adding climate considerations into the legislation underpinning agencies like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, as well as reinstating the role of the Climate Change Authority, are good steps. But don't get me wrong: this bill is the bare minimum. It contains no plans for how to reach the new emissions target and no plans for what will happen if we don't. It says nothing about sectoral plans to reduce emissions, to phase out fossil fuels or to support fossil fuel workers to transition into new areas of work. It's silent on measures to help local communities to invest in renewable energy and battery technology or policies to protect the health of Australians from the impacts of climate change. In other words, the bill is a start, but one that illustrates just how far we have to go. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are quite a few problems with this bill, there are some areas in particular that I'd like to focus on, and I foreshadow that I'll be moving two substantive amendments in the consideration in detail stage. Let's start with the Climate Change Authority, which will obviously have an important role in advising the minister—and the parliament—under the model proposed by the bill. Because it is important, the government must commit to repair, resource and guarantee the independence of the authority if it is to unwind the damage done by the previous coalition government, which, honourable members would recall, gutted the authority's funding and stacked it with gas industry executives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mind you, sadly, we know that the provision of expert advice by the authority and others will be no guarantee that the government will do the right thing. For example, eight years ago the Climate Change Authority recommended Australia adopt an emissions reduction target of between 45 per cent and 65 per cent, yet here we are in 2022 debating a miserable 43 per cent target, which is consistent with two degrees of global warming. But according to Climate Analytics, an increase of two degrees will see the end of the Great Barrier Reef and other tropical reefs around Australia, and it will result in three times more frequent and intense extreme heat events globally. Frankly, this target of 43 per cent is just too little, too late.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the science tells us right now that we need emissions targets which reflect the urgency of the situation. To that end, I will introduce amendments to the bill which update the paltry emissions targets currently in the legislation, in line with the science—that is, we need to aim for a 75 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and achieve net zero by 2035 at the latest. Failure to do this will be abrogating our responsibility as global citizens, failing future generations and locking in climate damage for decades to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, how we reach these emissions targets is just as important as the targets themselves. For a start, the government cannot rely on the false solutions and dangerous distractions peddled by the fossil fuel industry. For instance, carbon capture and storage continues to be pushed by fossil fuel interests, despite decades of experience showing that it is ineffective and costly and mostly benefits corporations seeking to access deeper deposits of oil. Similarly, carbon offsetting is not an effective way to tackle climate change, being the preferred choice for an industry desperate to keep polluting, and anyone who thinks that gas can be a transition fuel has some serious research to do. Good climate legislation should make clear that the time has passed for shifting baselines and reliance on junk credits. Exploration for new fossil fuels and the expansion of coal, oil and gas infrastructure must cease this year, but this bill does not do this, and that is a deeply worrying omission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament must also remember that, no matter what target the government writes into its legislation, if Australia continues to dig up and export thousands of tons of fossil fuels around the world then we have already blown the carbon budget. To illustrate the point, with 116 gas and coal projects under development currently, if the government continues with its pro fossil fuel agenda, we would see an additional 1.7 billion tons of carbon released into the atmosphere per year. To put it another way, if all the projects in the pipeline are approved it would be the equivalent of adding around five per cent more to global energy emissions. In other words, the Scarborough gas field project and fracking in the Beetaloo Basin alone would push us over the edge. The problem is, as things stand, much of this pollution won't even be counted in our national greenhouse gas databases, which means it is all too easy for politicians to ignore. But of course the atmosphere doesn't care about dodgy accounting rules. What matters to it, the environment, is the overall contribution of greenhouse gases that increases as a result of Australian decisions to dig up coal, oil and gas. So what I will also move is an amendment to include so-called scope 3 emissions, which are our exported emissions, in the annual climate change statement, because the Australian public should not be left in the dark about our huge contribution to global emissions, whatever good work we might be doing to reduce our emissions here at home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to make the point that this bill is a start. We do need a legislated target, and any moves towards greater transparency and reporting to the parliament on our climate efforts are a good thing. But, as the CSIRO told us last week, the uncomfortable truth is that the world has missed its opportunity to limit dangerous climate change within this century and we will have to wait until the beginning of the next century to see the benefit of emissions reductions that we do today. This means that every fraction of a degree avoided today will make a difference for our ecosystems, landscapes and communities, so we need much stronger action right now backed by clear policies and we need to start now.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I rise to speak on these important bills, the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. They are important bills. In fact, I think they are two of the most important bills to come before this House, and I don't say that lightly, because as members of parliament we have a duty, an absolute duty, to ensure that we deliver an environment that is sustainable for the next generation, not just for Australians but for the world over. We all have a duty as legislators around the world and I, for one, do not want to be in this place not having acted on something that will affect my children, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren. I don't want them saying in years to come that I was in parliament and did nothing about this very important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have a duty to act for the Australian public to ensure that we have an environment that we can continue to farm, continue to have our rivers flowing and ensure that people can live a healthy life. The consequences of no action are that there would be none of those things. There would be no farming, there would be no rivers flowing, and the consequences would be very dire for Australia and for the world. Over the last few years, we've seen inaction by the government. Back in 2007, when there was a proposal put on the table, it was seen as something that could be used for politics. The then Abbott coalition decided to play games with it and politicise it. But, if you look around the world, in most nations it's not a political football. People know the seriousness of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel like we've let down the Australian public. But, more so, we've let down the youth of this country—the youth that have been crying out for action on climate change. And we've seen protests, over the last 10 years, of students—school children—marching regularly so that some action will be taken. But they're not just marching because they want to protest or because they're activists. They want their voices heard, and they want leadership on this issue. I feel that we have let them down, because there's been no leadership on this very important issue. They've been let down by governments that have been too scared to act on climate change and who fear the consequences of acting on climate change more than the consequences of a changing climate. I don't want to betray young Australians anymore, and none of us should want to betray young Australians any longer. What we decide here in this House will impact their lives, their children's lives and their grandchildren's lives. As I said, it'll impact their future. I take the responsibility very seriously, as all of us should in this place. That's why this is a truly important bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people have spoken. They spoke at the last federal election. I heard them loud and clear in my electorate, and I know from speaking to many of my colleagues that they heard the message loud and clear. The Australian public wants action on climate change. They are sick of excuses. They want an end to the inaction that we've seen over the past decade, and they want an end to the climate wars. There are no climate wars. This is reality. As I said, around the world you'll find that this is not a contentious issue in most parliaments. On this side, we're listening and we're delivering on our election promises. To demonstrate our commitment, this bill is one of the first pieces of legislation to be introduced by the Albanese Labor government in the 47th Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's my sincere hope that this bill will finally turn the debate and action on climate change in a more positive direction, because the past decade has not just kept us stagnant; it's made us go backwards. We've seen energy prices rising. One of the reasons for that is that players in the energy market had no confidence that legislation that was in place, or may be in place, would remain. So they wouldn't invest. If you were an investor in renewables or an investor in new technologies to reduce emissions and you saw 22 different pieces of legislation, and none of them were acted on, why on earth would you invest when you don't know what the future holds? Hopefully this bill and this legislation will give some certainty to more investors who want to invest in renewables and new technologies. The more players we have in the field, the better for the prices. It brings in competition and lowers prices. One of the reasons we're seeing high energy prices at the moment is exactly that we haven't acted on climate change and we haven't given the certainty to industry and businesses so they can invest in renewables. Therefore, we have fewer players in the field, which makes competition harder and has made prices rise steadily over the last 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing climate change must be something that each and every person in this House takes on with utmost seriousness. This bill, as I said, provides precisely such an opportunity for this parliament and for our country. Who can forget the previous Prime Minister, before he became Prime Minister, coming in here with a hunk of coal and stating that this is the future of Australia? I felt embarrassed as a member of the Australian parliament that we had that action take place here on these benches. We were ridiculed around the world for that action, and people still raise it with me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a political football. This is a serious, serious occurrence that is taking place. Have a look at the wildfires taking place in Europe at the moment—places in Portugal, in Spain and in Greece where these wildfires are becoming regular, common occurrences. This is happening in California. We had wildfires and bushfires here in 2019. We had the flooding. We don't have to travel far. We can see the effects of climate change right here in this country, and we can also see greater effects in the Pacific with rising waters. If you go to places like Kiribati, already people are being evacuated off the island of Kiribati and relocated on Fiji as climate change refugees. I visited Kiribati a couple of years ago, and they showed us photographs of buildings that are now being swallowed up by the sea. So this is happening right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a serious issue, as I said, and we need to make sure that this bill gets through. I'm really disappointed to hear, again, the games that are being played by the opposition, as they were in 2008 during the Rudd government when we had a proposal on the table. As I said, having a stable, clear and coherent policy sends a vital message to the private sector, and that is really important. It sends a message also to the world that Australia is back as a good global citizen. It sends a message that Australia now has a government and a parliament that wants Australia to be a renewable energy powerhouse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own home state, we were one of the first states to bring in reusable cans and bottles. We've been doing these things for many years. We introduced single-use plastic bag bans, and we maintained a commitment to renewable energy over the past almost two decades. It was never, never a political football in the state of South Australia. Both the South Australian Liberal government and the Labor government supported these bipartisan policies in a bipartisan manner. I would want to see this go through in a bipartisan manner, because, as I said, it's our duty as members of parliament to make sure that we take action. Forty-three per cent may not be the be-all and end-all, and it certainly isn't, but it's a first step in the right direction. We owe it to the future generations of Australians and we owe it to this planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that we're seeing is that there's already technology in batteries, in renewables and in wind power. We have the sun here in Australia that shines for most of the year. We have wind farms and solar plants that we could generate to create energy, and lots of lots of new technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the disappointing things that I saw many years ago was in Portugal. At the time it had one of the biggest solar farms in the world, and everyone working there was Australian. The technology—everything—was imported from Australia, and they were saying to me that they'd left Australia because there was no real investment in renewables. These are the sorts of things that we've been missing out on. And that's only part of it. The worst part is that, in those 10 years, temperatures have risen, sea levels have risen. We need to take action.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is simply what I seek to do, and I'm joined by Liberal state governments in pursuing more ambitious emissions reduction targets. I'm proud to live in a state that's a leader in renewable energy. The government announced in 2021 that it would legislate a more ambitious emissions reduction target with net zero emissions by 2030, a feat already achieved in the last six of the past seven years. They're joined by our counterparts in Victoria and New South Wales, with targets of 50 per cent reduction by 2030. I'm not working against where we are heading in my home state of Tasmania or where we need to head as a country. It's just common sense, and like it or not it's what our nation voted for in the recent election. I understand that I come to this from the advantageous position of living in a state that has long had one of the greenest energy supplies in Australia. In fact, the city of Launceston in my northern Tasmanian electorate of Bass was the first in the country to be lit by hydropower, when the Duck Reach Power Station opened in 1895. In November 2020, 125 years later, Tasmania became the first Australian state, and one of just a handful of jurisdictions worldwide, to be wholly powered by renewable electricity. Nor do I suggest that policy and legislation as critical as this should not be scrutinised to the nth degree. That's the very reason why we're here. Yet the so-called climate wars and ideology around climate change persist, and I share the frustrations of so many in our community who just want to see the debate and fight end and get on with it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know many of my colleagues are representing the views of their communities, which have generational employment in the coal industry. As a Tasmanian, I saw firsthand the devastating impact in our state when the forestry industry was ripped to pieces. It devastated individuals, families, the economy and the community for a long time. It's only in recent years that we've begun to rebuild. However, I do believe that there is an inevitability to where we are heading as a country, but there is time for a just transition if we accept the reality. If not now, when?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own backyard of George Town is the Bell Bay Industrial Precinct, which produces 59 per cent of Tasmania's manufacturing exports. The local aluminium smelter has long been the backbone of this precinct. The smelter first opened in 1955, and the town has grown on the back of it, with generations of families employed at the smelter. As the former mayor of the town, and now its federal representative, I certainly have a strong understanding of what it would mean if the smelter were to suddenly close shop, as it provides hundreds of direct jobs and more than a thousand indirectly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The long-term future of the smelter was secured earlier this year after Rio Tinto signed a memorandum of understanding with the Tasmanian government, which includes Rio Tinto agreeing to prepare a business case for the production of hydrogen onsite, with the aim of replacing existing supplies of fossil gas. It is this forward thinking that is creating a brighter, cleaner and more economically secure future for Bell Bay and the greater northern Tasmanian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accepting what the future may hold and doing all you can to prepare for it ensures that when the time inevitably comes the sky does not fall in. It's this recognition that saw the establishment of the Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone, an industry based economic development group borne out of a desire by businesses in the region to better collaborate and to grow the region's capabilities by supporting existing businesses, encouraging investment and promoting the benefits of the region as a place to live and work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising the threats and opportunities that lie ahead has seen the area and local industries embrace the development of a green hydrogen industry. After many years of consultation with local industry, key stakeholders and local, state and federal governments, I announced $70 million for a green hydrogen hub in Bell Bay in late April, a commitment matched by Labor. The traditional skills of workers at the smelter are also being utilised by emerging industries that are setting up in Tasmania, attracted to our renewable power grid. These include companies like Firmus, which has built an ultra-low-emissions and high-performance cloud and is hiring highly skilled workers across several fields, including power systems.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Though, of course, there will never be a whole consensus on the matter in our northern Tasmanian community, I have met with and heard from countless organisations and individuals who are truly passionate about seeing the government of the day take more action on climate change and have specifically asked me to do what I can, in the role that I have, to bring about this much-needed change. The people of Bass put their trust in me to represent their views.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Launceston Chamber of Commerce is over 170 years old and has consistently adapted and advanced causes in the best interests of the local business community. In 2020, the chamber adopted a climate change policy favouring initiatives that support a reduction in carbon emissions and benefit Tasmanian businesses and the broader community. These include the creation of new enterprises and initiatives that contribute to carbon emissions reduction. Chamber President Andrew Pitt recently expressed to me that the last thing business needs is ongoing uncertainty around legislated carbon future. While the chamber would like to see a more ambitious target than 43 per cent, Andrew went on to say that this is a starting point that should help Australian industries confidently transition to a low-carbon future and will provide our region of Tasmania with a competitive advantage.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Northern Tasmanian winemaker Stewart Byrne has witnessed the effect a warmer climate is having on many of the established Australian viticultural regions in warmer climates. Mr Byrne said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They are becoming marginal. The increased growing season temperatures have resulted in lower fruit quality, compressed harvest periods, and a subsequent greater pressure on winery infrastructure. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Here in Tasmania, where the prediction models have us being the least affected of the viticultural regions from a climate change perspective, we are still experiencing challenges. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fire and the subsequent effect of smoke damage on fruit, has resulted in significant losses in 3 of our past 10 years and dry lightning strikes are a relatively new phenomenon in Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tasmania also has limited resources. The eastern side of Tasmania, where the majority of vineyards are planted, is dry. As the climate continues to change, and as more vineyards and farming operations move to Tasmania, it will put further strain on our resources. We will then need to have discussions on whether vineyards are the best use for this increasingly valuable land. So, the threat of climate change on the wine industry is multi-faceted, both in the short and long term.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've witnessed parts of the debate around the issue of climate change be patronised by some as being a young, leftie, elite issue. I absolutely dispute this characterisation. This issue transcends age, gender, political affiliation, religious belief and socioeconomic circumstance. In the northern Tasmanian community I've met with and received emails and letters from local school and uni students, Baptist ministers, doctors, retired teachers, business leaders, grandparents and pensioners from both the Left and the Right. All of them believe that this is not an issue of Left or Right but where the future of our country needs to be—solely at the centre. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week I received an email from a 70-year-old lifelong Liberal supporter who wants to see our party and our country move ahead with greater action on climate change, and he's not alone. To this gentleman and to the thousands of other northern Tasmanians who've reached out to me via email or through my community survey and identified climate change as one of their most significant concerns: I have heard you. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After reviewing Labor's legislation I've spent a lot of time deciding how to proceed. I believe there are issues with the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. I will not be supporting this bill, due to my concerns over the impact it may have on important infrastructure projects, for example. However, I will be supporting Labor's Climate Change Bill 2022. At the end of the day, it's important to me that when I'm back in my own community I'm able to sincerely say that I used the opportunity afforded to me with the power of my vote to stand up for what they want and need and to move on from this debate. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had incredibly constructive discussions with the Leader of the Opposition about my views and those of the party on this issue. While there is much that we do agree on, I believe he understands why I've made this decision. I have respect for him, and he has my support as our party formulates our own plan to combat climate change while supporting the Australian economy. However, while that happens, it is important that we do move forward, that we act now and that we do not delay until the eve of the next election.</span>

When it comes to climate change policy in Australia over the last 10 years, it's been a disappointing story of division and years of missed opportunity. As someone who worked for more than a decade for a science and engineering organisation before coming to this place in 2018, these have been particularly frustrating times for me. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we now have the opportunity to end the climate wars and start addressing one of the great challenges this nation faces. There is no time to waste. The recent <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report is a stark reminder of this. I have spoken with some of the passionate public servants who put this critical report together. It's a harrowing report that tells a story of crisis and decline in Australia's environment, with the pressures of climate change being a major contributing factor. The report explains that over the last five years at least 19 ecosystems have shown signs of collapse or near collapse. Marine heatwaves and ocean acidification are destroying our Great Barrier Reef, causing coral bleaching and threatening 150 reef species. Australia has lost more mammal species than any other continent and has one of the highest rates of species decline in the developed world. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in my electorate of Bean understand this first hand. The 2019-20 bushfires that swept across Namadgi National Park and Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve were one of the largest ecological disasters in the ACT's history. Here at Parliament House, our first occasion to wear masks was because of the air pollution from those fires. For a week we had the worst air quality across the world. As reported by CSIRO, climate change contributed to this catastrophic event. The impact of climate change has led to longer, more intense fire seasons and an increase in the number of elevated fire weather days. The year 2019 was the driest year since records began in 1900, and it was Australia's warmest year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to taking more ambitious action on climate change. It is what we promised to the Australian people in the last election, and we haven't wasted any time since. Last month we updated our nationally determined contribution under the Paris agreement. This formalised Australia's international pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, reaffirming Australia's commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050. It also committed the government to providing an annual statement to parliament on progress towards these targets and restored Australia's Climate Change Authority as a source of independent policy advice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government co-hosted the Sydney Energy Forum with the International Energy Agency, supported by the Business Council of Australia. It brought together governments and the private sector to identify practical opportunities to transition to clean energy. This included clean energy technologies such as solar, hydrogen, critical minerals and batteries. Ministers from the US, Japan, India, Indonesia and Pacific islands among others attended, and Australia's new position on climate change was welcomed. A partnership agreement between the government and the US was signed at the forum, agreeing to accelerate work on a zero-emissions technology and promote economic growth. The forum demonstrated that Australia can transition through to a net-zero economy while also providing clean, affordable and secure energy to countries in our region for their own transitions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Pacific Islands Forum, Prime Minister Albanese reassured our Pacific partners of Australia's strengthened commitment to combating climate change. It was also acknowledged as a primary economic and security challenge for our region and an existential threat to the island countries of the Pacific.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister for climate change recently signed regulations to strengthen the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ensuring it remains focused on renewables and electrification. Since the agency's establishment in 2012 under Labor, it has delivered $8 billion worth of value to the Australian economy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, as one of our first acts in parliament, we are introducing our Climate Change Bill. This seeks to enshrine in law our nationally determined contribution of 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. This target is a floor, not a ceiling, and it has been backed in by representatives of business and unions, energy users and energy providers, farmers and conservationists. The bill will also explicitly task in law the Climate Change Authority to assess and publish progress against these targets and advise government on future targets, including the 2035 target. It will legislate a requirement for the minister for climate change to report annually to parliament on its progress. Legislating the target is international best practice. It creates much-needed certainty for business, investors and the wider community. It also will see Australia rejoin key trading partners in their ambition to 2030. For example, Canada has a target of 40 to 45 per cent; South Korea, 40 per cent; and Japan, 46 per cent. Most importantly, the 43 per cent target is backed by a plan. We know we can reach it because of the modelled impact of a comprehensive set of policies.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has natural advantages when transitioning to renewables. We have an abundance of natural energy, including plenty of sun and wind resources across our magnificent landmass. We also have the skills and expertise to lead the transformation to renewable energy. This is an opportunity for us to jump ahead of the pack. Our plan has the potential to create more than 600,000 jobs and it will spur $76 billion worth of investment. The fastest way to combat the rising cost of energy is by getting more firm renewable energy into the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current global energy crisis has emphasised the need for collaboration and to position energy security at the centre of the renewable energy transformation. As we saw in Australia, the combination of high fossil fuel prices and ageing coal power stations resulted in energy prices skyrocketing, leaving families struggling to pay their bills. We know the best way to get those prices down is to make it cheaper and more efficient to transmit energy, to get more cleaner and cheaper energy into the system. The AEMO underline this view, recently stating that Australia's energy future lies in firm renewables, which it says is clearly the cheapest reliable power option by a country mile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra's energy transition is a great example of what can be achieved. At a time when higher energy prices are trending across the country, electricity prices in Canberra are forecast to decrease by 1.25 per cent over the coming year. This is credited to the ACT's long-term renewable energy contracts, which more than offset the increase in wholesale electricity costs. Essentially, we are now a territory powered 100 per cent by renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can close the gap between the federal government and state and territory governments when it comes to investing in renewables that will power Australia. All states and territories, on both sides of politics, have expressed a real desire to work with us to get there and we will be working in collaboration with them to drive down emissions while ensuring secure, affordable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the support we are seeing for our climate action plan from states and territories, the business community, unions, energy generators and energy users, we may be more successful and achieve greater emission reductions than forecast. That is why the target should be seen as a floor and not a ceiling. Furthermore, our nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement are built on ratcheting up aggregate and individual ambition over time. Nevertheless, we know with current projections that a 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 is what we can achieve with the comprehensive range of policies we took to the Australian public. These policies were endorsed at the last election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is serious about climate change, as has been clearly demonstrated by what we have achieved in only two months in government and what we are set to achieve in our first sitting weeks in parliament. We can end the climate wars, move forward together and get on with the job of tackling one of the greatest challenges this nation has faced. We owe it to the families and communities we represent in this place. Marcus, Eamonn and Stella, this is for you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I would like to begin my contribution by explaining what we are trying to achieve by legislating a 43 per cent reduction in carbon emissions. Carbon dioxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere. It is an odourless, tasteless and invisible gas that is essential to all life on this planet. It is plant food. Without carbon dioxide, plants cannot photosynthesise and they will die. That is a fact. Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. Our atmosphere is made up of 78 per cent nitrogen, 21 per cent oxygen and 0.9 per cent argon. The other 0.1 per cent is made up of a lot of trace gases, and one of them is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is 0.04 of the atmosphere. To put that in a mathematical equation, according to the IPCC, man is responsible for three per cent of that 0.04 per cent. That equates to 0.0012 per cent of the atmosphere. Australia is responsible for 1.4 per cent of that. So 1.4 per cent of 0.0012 per cent is 0.0000168 per cent of the atmosphere. What we are proposing to do is reduce that number by 43 per cent. Forty-three per cent of 0.0000168 per cent equates to 0.00000722 per cent of atmospheric carbon dioxide. To put that into rough round figures, that is 7¼ millionths of one per cent. That is what we are trying to achieve mathematically by implementing 43 per cent zero net carbon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investments in renewable energy generation, solar and wind, have already put Australia in a very precarious position regarding electrical energy security. Prices are escalating rapidly to the serious detriment of our economy. We once had cheap electricity, and now we have amongst the most expensive electricity in the world. Legislating for an even more aggressive pursuit of a flawed strategy will give rent-seekers and activists the leverage to make the situation worse by compelling the private sector to make wrong decisions. Moreover, we have denied ourselves the rational alternatives, including HELE coal-fired power stations, access to enormous natural gas reserves and nuclear power generation. Australia cannot return to low inflation rates, greater industrial self-reliance and reduced costs of living without reliable, low-cost energy that is achievable by utilising our abundant resources. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During last week, all seven of Queensland's coal-fired stations operated near maximum capacity, exporting 900 to 1,000 megawatts of electricity daily to all southern states, and yet we are told that they must be phased out as soon as possible. The notion that solar panels and wind turbines can reduce emissions is a myth. Due to the construction materials required, they have a negative environmental impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill claims to implement a range of new policies and programs, including rewiring the nation, an enhanced safeguard mechanism and Australia's first electric vehicle strategy to drive emissions reductions necessary to meet these targets. I would like to draw your attention to the Queensland Transport and Public Works Committee—which I was a part of—inquiry into transport technology that was held in 2020. The inquiry investigated the implementation of electric vehicles in Queensland. The Department of Transport and Main Roads said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… if EVs are typically charged during peak demand periods, EV charging will be more costly for owners and electricity demand will increase to levels that require our relevant local networks to be upgraded. That cost will ultimately be reflected in increased electricity prices for everyone.</span>

                    </a>  I'll turn now to the safeguard mechanism outlined in the bill. Under the safeguard mechanism, businesses that have emissions over the baseline must buy carbon credits for the emissions above the baseline. Of the 215 largest industrial facilities, 28 are operating in the Capricornia electorate and 18 in the Flynn electorate in Central Queensland. Labor's modelling shows that this will force these businesses to purchase 40 million tonnes or $166 billion worth of offsets by 2030 based on current Australian carbon credit unit prices. That's $1.66 billion in costs that will make these businesses less competitive, forcing jobs and industries offshore. Modelling of the government's plan found that forcing net zero by 2050 through a mandated approach would require a carbon tax of between $80 and $400 a tonne and the conversion of up to 10 per cent of productive agricultural land into vegetation to store carbon. Ultimately this carbon tax on regional Queensland and Australia will force job losses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to turn to a <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> article that clearly highlights a total backflip by the honourable member for McMahon with respect to our safeguard mechanism. This newspaper article says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was on 21 April 2022, yet three months later, on 24 July 2022, the same newspaper stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a total backflip on a Labor election promise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also refer to what happened this afternoon in respect of an agreement made by the Leader of the Greens and the Labor Party. This is all to do with the Australian domestic gas security mechanism. At the National Press Club today the Leader of the Greens confirmed that, to secure Greens support, the Albanese government would include in its climate change legislation restrictions on the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, Export Finance Australia and Infrastructure Australia. These changes will make it harder, if not impossible, for these agencies to recommend or provide finance and insurance to projects in the energy, resources and agricultural sectors. What will become of the Perdaman urea project in Western Australia, which will provide urea fertiliser for the agricultural industry? Are these projects going to be terminated?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, Australia produces one-quarter of the world's emissions of carbon dioxide. The proposed legislation would reduce this by a small fraction of the extra emissions coming from recent increases in coal usage in Europe and the planned increases in India, China, Korea and Africa. So this is pious and aspirational virtue signalling which can have no effect on emissions worldwide. In just 16 days China produces the equivalent of Australia's entire yearly emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to close with some more science. I know that the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound. That is why those opposite appear bright until they begin to speak.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  I just say in response to that insult from the member for Flynn that a true reflection of a fool is that he doesn't recognise his own idiocy. I really think that the pseudoscience created by the member for Flynn was just another reflection of the horrible last 10 years in the climate debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change has been talked about since the 19th century. The effects on our climate are reflected in our health outcomes. That has been well recognised throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In Australia we're finally taking definitive action to have a climate change policy that reflects the true science. Rising emissions are leading to increased atmospheric CO2. It's quite correct that the carbon dioxide content of our atmosphere is small, but very small increases in atmospheric CO2 have a very potent effect on the warming of the earth and on our inability to reflect that heat back into the galaxy. It's well and truly time to develop a climate policy, an energy policy, that works for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change affects the whole social and environmental determinants of health. Climate change is estimated to cause at least a quarter of a million unnecessary deaths around the world every year. It costs around US$4 billion every year in adverse effects. It's the biggest health threat that's facing humanity. It is really time that we recognise that. I am really glad that we now have a government with policies in place that will do what we should be doing for climate and energy policy and should have been doing many, many years ago. We have had 10 years of inaction, 10 years of worsening emissions, and 10 years of a lack of surety and clarity for investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very concerned about the health effects of climate change, and certainly my electorate has been one of the areas around Sydney that has been more severely affected than many. We have had terrible floods. We have had heatwaves. We have had increased hospital admissions with respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease and neurological disease. We have had annual days in Macarthur with temperatures over 45 degrees—more than we have ever had before. We have had record temperatures in our schools and a lack of ability to manage this in any effective way. We have had children admitted to hospital with sunstroke. We have had children who have died from severe sun injury and heat stroke, and we have had elderly people die in their homes from heat stroke. These are just some of the effects of climate change that we have seen in the last few years in my electorate of Macarthur. We have seen increases in infectious diseases and, as the average global temperature increases, they are likely to get worse. We have had mosquito-borne infectious disease, food-borne infectious diseases such as salmonella and waterborne infectious disease, and we will continue to see this worsening unless we can control our climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, Australia has a relatively small effect on global emissions but it is an effect that can be reduced and we should, like a good world neighbour, do the right thing and introduce adequate climate policy, which this government is doing by introducing the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. We have had increases in mortality in my own electorate from respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease and neurological disease. We have had deaths from flooding. We have had deaths, as I mentioned, from sunstroke. We have had increases in mental health difficulties because of huge temperatures. We have had pregnancy loss because of heat exhaustion. There are nutritional effects of climate change, and we have had an increase in skin diseases and allergies that are a reflection of very high summer temperatures. There are occupational health injuries from manual labour for people who work in industry, and we have a large industrial group in Macarthur. We have had direct effects, like I have said, of heat injury. We have had extreme weather events causing loss of life and injury. You may remember the most recent Hawkesbury-Nepean floods had a severe effect on many of the smaller suburbs and towns around my electorate of Macarthur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is evidence that these rising temperatures have increased the risk of cataracts and corneal damage. We have decreases in quality of life like impaired sleep and impaired ability to be active, leading to increases in obesity and diabetes. There are increases in asthma and respiratory admissions with chronic airway disease to our local hospitals, and I have certainly seen that in children in my electorate. These links are well known, yet we have had 10 years of inaction. We have had nothing from the conservative forces on the other side but vituperation, insults, anxiety and conflicts. Who could forget the member for Cook's really terrible act of bringing a lump of coal into parliament? Yet we have on this side—</span>

                    </a>  I apologise for that, Chair. Around the country, there have been severe effects of climate change. Yes, there is action, and thank God that there is, but we need to reduce our emissions dramatically, and we will do that with a plan outlined by the minister. I am very grateful to him for doing that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sick of the terrible conflict and the terrible way that this whole issue has been approached by the Liberal-National coalition. They haven't learnt their lesson; they should have. They have had a wave of the Australian population vote against them because of their lack of action on climate. Until they recognise that, nothing will change on their side. Luckily, we have a Labor government that will now act on climate change, in cooperation with a whole range of other parties and other people—not before time—and thank God for that.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, of course I have. I've been right through outback New South Wales and Queensland and seen it. To approach it in such an oppositional way is really just damaging yourselves now. You're not learning your lesson.</span>

                    </a>  I really think that some of the speeches from that side reflect that you really haven't learnt, and it's a shame. It is something that the Australian population understands now and wants us to act on. We will do that, and it will create jobs and will create prosperity. We will be an energy powerhouse; there's no question. But we must move away from this oppositional approach.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr VAN MANEN:</span>
                    </a>  I have to say that I do commiserate with the member for Macarthur and the member for Moreton as I reflect on the floods that have occurred in all of our electorates over the past six months and also back in 2017. I know that, for the member for Macarthur, they have occurred a couple of times this year as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I enjoy studying history because history can be very, very instructive. I would pull up the member for Macarthur on the term 'climate change' because I would call it something different. I would call it a 'change in climate' because, as the member for Moreton well knows and given the floods that we've had in my electorate of Forde, we have had worse floods historically. As the member for Parkes would know, they've had worse droughts historically in the member for Parkes's electorate. So it's not to do with the term 'climate change'; it's actually to do with a change in climate. And one of the reasons we have the impacts in our electorates that we do—as the members for Macarthur and Moreton well know and as I have said on the public record a number of times—is that our state governments and our councils have allowed housing projects and industrial developments to be built on flood plains that have historically flooded on a regular basis. The consequence of that is dire because over time, as our population has grown, as our industrial developments have grown and as the value of our assets has grown, the financial impact of those events on our communities has been greater.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are obviously having a very important discussion about the financial impacts of a changing climate. That is perfectly valid. But we are not having a discussion about the practical measures that could be taken to mitigate the effects of a changing climate, because we have failed to properly plan for future development in our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will put on the record that I am proud of the fact that the previous coalition government—and I believe the current government is continuing this in Queensland, at least—had a $750 million fund to allow property owners to relocate, build back better or modify their properties. I think that is a fantastic initiative. That is the sort of stuff we should be pursuing as practical measures. I saw the other day a discussion about the flood plains around Western Sydney and the future of development there and maybe relocating some towns. As the member for Moreton would know, after the events in Grantham in 2011 the town was actually substantially relocated. That is the practical stuff that we should be doing to mitigate the impacts of a changing climate in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to get floods in the future. We are going to have fires in the future. We are going to have cyclones in the future. All of those things are guaranteed to happen. The reason I say that is that they have happened in the past. But if we think that just focusing on reducing our CO2 emissions is going to be the silver bullet that solves this problem we are seriously kidding ourselves. Those things happened when the CO2 levels in our atmosphere were far, far lower than they are today. So let's learn from history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not to say the climate isn't changing. I'm not saying that we don't have a responsibility to look after our environment and make it a better place for the current generation and also ensure that we leave an environment that is in better condition for future generations. I absolutely have no problem with that argument whatsoever. There is much we can do in that space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember having a discussion with a former environment minister, the former member for Flinders Greg Hunt, about riparian corridors on waterways. One of the great advantages of riparian corridors on waterways is that they slow down floodwaters. You reduce, then, the transfer of silt that would impact on waterways further down the course or, in the case of North Queensland, you reduce the level of silt that would go out into the Great Barrier Reef. It is these practical measures, in my view, that we should be looking at. We know as well that riparian corridors become a source of CO2 sequestration. There are arguments from some scientists for this. There is a scientist in Queensland by the name of Bill Burrows who wrote a submission to a parliamentary inquiry suggesting that, with our forests and rain plains, we continue to develop and grow those out. Those measures will greatly assist with getting to net zero or will even ensure that we are at net zero, rather than other measures we are currently discussing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear those opposite say regularly that the 43 per cent reduction is a plan. The 43 per cent isn't a plan; it's a target. It's a target, by the way, that doesn't have to be legislated, because the government has already signed up to it. The government has already signed up, so there's no need for this legislation. The worst part about this legislation is that there is no plan attached—zero. There is nothing in this legislation that creates a plan to achieve that 43 per cent reduction. As I look at what—</span>

                    </a>  I will take the member for Moreton's interjection, because he's a good friend. The government proposes to rewire the nation, in their words, at an investment of—I believe the climate change minister said this today in question time—$131 billion in total. Given that that is a regulated asset and requires a return—the regulator return is somewhere around five to 5½ per cent. That's a return of somewhere in the order of $6½ billion to $7 billion, in round numbers, per annum. Ultimately, who's going to pay for that? It's a regulated asset. The consumers of electricity are going to pay for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have said that they are going to reduce electricity bills by $275 through to 2025. At a cost of $7½ billion across 25 million people it's going to cost the Australian consumer $300 a year, because of that investment in a regulated asset. How are those opposite going to reduce electricity bills by $275 a year when their exact plan is to increase electricity prices by $300 a year? It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't add up.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased—in the last 40 seconds of this contribution—that the opposition has put nuclear energy on the agenda this week, because if those opposite and those on the crossbench are serious about achieving a net zero target by 2050 nuclear energy is the only solution, in addition to a range of other things that are already being done.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  I was elected in November 2007 on a policy of responding to dangerous climate change. Way back then in the Dark Ages it was actually a joint ticket with my Liberal opponent, a former minister. Then after that a wrecking ball called Tony Abbott weaponised sensible policy. For short-term political expediency he weaponised any response to the loud scientific warnings. Since that day of infamy when Tony Abbott became the Leader of the Liberal Party in December 2009, when the then member for Warringah weaponised saving this planet, I have despaired about this building actually responding to dangerous climate change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last nine years I have stood up in parliament and talked about the need for urgent action while the dilettantes and grifters opposite tried 22 different versions of sweet, sweet nothing. While they fiddled our homes burned. While they fiddled our homes have flooded. We've have been hammered by the elements in all the ways that the climate scientists warned us about. There is more frequent flooding. There are higher and erosive tides, and more harsh and destructive bushfires to come. That is what the CSIRO tells us. I am not a scientist. I listen to the CSIRO.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sensible Australians have contacted their federal members and senators right across the country urging the parliament to act on addressing dangerous climate change. I was here when the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—the CPRS—was passed in the House of Representatives. I remember Malcolm Turnbull actually sitting with the Labor party for that vote. Then I went over to that other chamber to watch the coalition and the Greens combine to vote down the CPRS. I also witnessed—right up in that part of the chamber—a little coven of government members, including the now Leader of the Opposition, hugging and cheering when the coalition withdrew Labor's carbon-pricing scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have been on a very long journey to get us to where this chamber is today. These bills will enshrine the nation's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to get us to net zero by 2050. Labor's commitment will become law.</span>

Then we had the member for Flynn—oh my goodness! His approach to science was antediluvian—unbelievable. I'm not sure what niche clientele he's trying to address, but it's unbelievable. If he is the hope of the Liberal National Party, then heaven help the Liberal National Party in Queensland. Oh my goodness! I couldn't believe that he would be so backward looking and so unscientific.</span>

If the choice is listening to the voice of Boyce or Joyce, there's no choice at all, as far as I'm concerned. Labor knows that legislating targets provides the strongest possible signal to industry and investors. We know that because we saw what happened when those scoundrels were dancing and celebrating taking back Labor's scheme. Private investment in renewable energy fell off a cliff. We'd been one of the world leaders of private capital flocking to invest in infrastructure—like wind farms up around Armidale, around Glen Innes, great pieces of infrastructure that I know are powering my sister's home in the member for New England's electorate right now. We know that legislating targets will give a great signal to private investment and private capital. It will also help to restore our nation's international reputation, giving us the opportunity to capitalise on the opportunities arising from global climate action.</span>

Labor took a 43 per cent target to the election as a minimum commitment. We built consensus across industry, environmental groups, farmers, business et cetera, to give certainty to all of them. A 2030 target of 43 per cent has received the support of the Australian Industry Group—well-known communist clientele, obviously; the Business Council of Australia—obviously a mob of lefties; the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—sounds like an offshoot of the Socialist Party; the Clean Energy Council; the Australian Conservation Foundation; the Australian Council of Trade Unions; and the National Farmers Federation. Our commitment to reduce emissions to 43 per cent below 2005 by 2030 is part of a credible pathway to net zero.</span>

It enshrines in law the nationally determined contribution of 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. It gives the Climate Change Authority the job of assessing and publishing progress against these targets, as well as advising government on future targets, including the 2035 target. It provides accountability, by making it a requirement for the minister for climate change to report annually to parliament on the progress in meeting our targets. And it inserts the nation's targets in the objectives and functions of a range of government agencies, including the mighty ARENA, CEFC, Infrastructure Australia and the NAIF.</span>

Much as with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap </span>report, the annual address to parliament by the climate change minister is about updating the parliament and the nation on the progress we're making to meet our climate goals. We're here at this very important moment in time when we can get Australia back on track, get real action underway and provide certainty on Australia's low-carbon future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the election I received hundreds of emails of congratulations, and the consistent theme was that people were relieved that finally Australia had a government that understands climate change is real, a government determined to reduce our emissions by boosting renewable energy. Just recently, in a survey of young people in my electorate, over 90 per cent of respondents said that voting for a party with a climate change policy was the major factor in determining how they voted in 2022. But, more than that, addressing climate and moving to renewables were the defining issues shared across so many different groups in my electorate. </span>

Our Powering Australia plan also includes a number of other policies that will boost the renewable energy sector and accelerate and support regions at the front of the energy industry. There will be a lot of jobs for the bush. It's good to see that the Labor Party is continuing its fine tradition of looking after the bush. We delivered all those great policies for the bush, like education, Medicare and NBN. They are great things for the bush. Labor delivers for the bush; the National Party have given up on the bush.

                    </a>  Sorry, Pat. The $20 billion Rewiring the Nation investment will modernise the grid and provide the country with more renewables, more transmission and more storage. Any facility that emits over 100,000 tonnes of emissions will be included in the safeguard mechanism, which is a little like that trade-exposed industries mechanism in the old CPRS. The safeguard mechanism reforms will work with big emitters on a trajectory to net zero by 2050. We've got to be sensible and get the trajectory right. Large listed companies and financial institutions have been calling for mandatory climate disclosure standards and will need to disclose their emissions under new standards, ensuring investors have all the information they need to make sustainable investment decisions. This government aims to tackle climate change from all sides, reducing greenhouse gas emissions overall, creating new jobs in the renewable energy sector and ensuring fair support and protections for workers transitioning out of fossil fuel industries. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate has been subject to devastating floods—back in 2011 and again in February this year. These floods hit my community hard. I know that the people of Moreton are resilient. I know they're rebuilding their homes and their lives, but it's tough. It's challenging. And people are very, very tired. They're tired of inaction when it comes to responding to climate change, so I hear their anguish. We know that we're going to face more frequent and more severe disasters because of climate change. That is what the CSIRO tells us. This is the reality, and individuals can only do so much, but that is not a reason to do nothing, which seems to be the argument proselytised by those opposite, particularly the member for Flynn. I know that those opposite have indicated they will not support our climate change legislation, although it was great to hear one of them say that they would be backing it tonight. That was someone who actually got an increased margin in the recent election. I can't understand, when your party loses the election, why you would do that.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  I've always wondered why perfectly sane, well-educated individuals fall for this form of absolutism. I believe that the attraction is primarily aesthetic and that the experience is fun, because the world of a sort of quasi-conspiracy theory is very like the world of a game. The rage and fear and conviction that conspiracy theorists display are aestheticised versions of the real things. This perennial focus on the weather is a peculiar tension between philosophical monism and an alternative view. Tonight we've even heard of that quasi-religion—and it is a quasi-religion. They extol the virtue of believers. They talk about deniers. They have an absolute belief, without any version of thermodynamics or atmospheric science. It is a form and extension of a paranoia. We've heard tonight about disease, temperature, floods, fires—a great catastrophe, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse—which are somehow to be avoided by the passage of a piece of legislation through this House. It is a fact that there is nothing of this legislation that will affect the climate—nothing at all. It is a form of virtue signalling. It is a form of—at its best—being a part of a global movement, but a global movement that the vast majority of the globe is not part of. What it will do is massive damage to our economy at a time when our nation should become as strong as possible, as quickly as possible. It will cost you money. Whether it's on a domestic front or on a global front, it is costing you money now. Your price of power is higher because of climate policy, whether you think of it as virtuous or not. You are poorer because of climate policy. You pay more for fuel because of climate policy. Prior to the war in Ukraine, there was a so-called wind drought in England, and the price of power went through the roof, multiple times above where it was. Hundreds of thousands of people were dropped off their power provider, because they said, 'We just can't do it anymore.' This was the outcome of a wind drought, and then came the war in Ukraine. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you believe that fuel is too cheap, support this. If you believe the price of power is too cheap, support this. If you believe the price of food is too cheap, support this. If you want to take more money out of your wallet and send it to somebody else, support this. But remember: another person on the other side of the transaction is getting your money, make no mistake about that. People and companies are becoming exceptionally wealthy by reason of this process, make no mistake about that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake that every wind tower is basically fully imported. Make no mistake that every photovoltaic cell is not made in Australia; it's made overseas. Make no mistake that the overwhelming majority of the companies participating in this are foreign owned. Make no mistake about that. Make no mistake about the hundreds of thousands of acres of footprints that renewables take. Make no mistake about the divisive nature this now has in regional areas, where people, who are even family members, are pitted one against the other as they argue about the transmission lines that go across their country, that their places have been turned into an industrial landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will not happen in Warringah, so they can support it. It's not going to happen in Wentworth. It's not going to happen in urban areas; it happens in our seats. I tell you right now, if you want to create a coalition between the Greens, Labor, the Liberals and the Nationals, the way to do it is to propose a wind farm in their area, and you will do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk about renewables as the cheapest form of power. That is complete and utter garbage. Power is sold in five-minute blocks. If we were to come into this chamber and say, 'I'm only prepared for the power to stay on for five minutes', that would be an absurdity. For five minutes the wind's blowing, the power's on and it's very cheap. But after that it goes out and the lights go out. In five-minute blocks, I can make anything cheap. I can make a car that goes down a hill the cheapest car in Australia. I can say: it uses no fuel; it's green. Of course—it's running downhill. It's when it has to go up the other side that it creates a problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be selling power in 24-hour blocks. You provide the reliability to provide power for 24 hours and then you would see the real cost of renewables. They wouldn't be able to compete, not without substantial back-up, substantial pump hydro and substantial batteries. If every battery now in Europe was turned on to take the place of coal-fired power stations and nuclear, the power in Europe would stay on for less than two minutes. That is the absurdity and the quasi-religious nature of this argument, this absolute belief without question. The fact that you are derided and pilloried if you dare question, it is a very dangerous thing. Some very dangerous things have happened in history because of unquestioning belief. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, you may say, 'Well, how do we go into this process when it's unreasonable?' The only way we can sort of find a meeting ground is to get nuclear power. If you want zero emissions, you've got to get nuclear power. They say it's incredibly expensive. That is not the truth. In the recent reports, small modular reactors are vastly safer and exceptionally cheaper. They are made in factories. NewScale has recently received its approval through one of the hardest submission processes that you would ever get. They are made in factories. They are 20 metres long. They are three metres wide. They come in on the back of a truck. Yet we say we can't do it. We're repeating the mistake of sending our coal overseas and our iron ore overseas, but we resile from the fact that we're going to make motorcars in Australia and do the manufacturing in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once more, we've resigned ourselves to being the dumb country. We're going to be the dumbos. We're going to export the rock because we don't believe in ourselves and we don't have the confidence in ourselves to produce the technologies. Why is it that every OECD country produces nuclear power except us? Are we the wise ones and they're all stupid?—you know: 'There goes my son. He's the only one in step.' Is this how it is? Why don't we grasp the issue and say: 'If this is what we're going to do—if we're going to export uranium—let's export the technology. Let's be the clever ones. Let's make it safe. Let's make it cheap. Let's have confidence in ourselves.' But we don't, and we should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the perspective of the community has changed. I've never been to a meeting yet where a majority of the people were not for nuclear power. They can't work out why we're not for nuclear power. If you say: 'Well, where are we going to put it?' that's a divisive issue. We could have an assessment of where people want it. Put it to them. Say to people: 'If you can see the power plant, you get your power for free. If you can see it, your power's free,' and then see what the response is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, we have one nuclear facility in Australia smack-bang in the geographical centre of our biggest city, and no-one has really got a concern about it. In recent years, they've sold spare blocks for a million dollars a pop. So I am going to be a bookend, I am going to be the sceptic, because I don't like this quasi-religion that has evolved about this. Politically, I even find it very dangerous. At other times in history, this quasi-religion, this absolute belief, this unquestioning adherence has done some very dangerous things. You need people to stand up and say: 'I'm going to question this,' because it's got to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say that this legislation is going to change nothing. It will make you poorer. You are going to pay for this. Every time you buy your fuel, you will pay for climate policy. Every time you buy your groceries, you will pay for climate policy. Every time you get your power bill, you most definitely will be paying for climate policy. And this legislation is going to make it worse. You are going to become poorer still. And because of this, the temperature of the globe will stay exactly where it is at the moment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  It's always a matter of interest to follow the member for New England in this chamber. I don't think that he will be surprised when I suggest that no-one in Australia is going to be shocked by the news that the member for New England is sceptical about Labor's climate change policy, because he was part of the problem. He actually was the Deputy Prime Minister and part of the problem. There were nine years of utter wasted time and wasted opportunity in this nation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with pleasure that I get to stand in this chamber of the Australian parliament this evening to speak on Labor's Climate Change Bill 2022, because this is the first real climate action bill in years that this parliament has seen. It's a bill that we're actually going to get to vote on. It is a first step in implementing the Albanese government's mandate and the policy, Powering Australia, that we took to the election. Australia has been crying out for action on climate change, and on 21 May the Australian people voted for change. They rejected the Morrison-Joyce government's refusal to take action on climate change, the blatant disregard for science and the brutal climate wars that prevented any real action on climate change for more than a decade.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Newcastle knows probably better than most the importance not only of reaching net zero by 2050 but of diversifying and strengthening our economic base with renewable energy. The member for New England suggested that only members like his good self might, perhaps, understand the real impacts of these changes. Well, I've got to tell you that the people of Newcastle, the world's largest exporting port for coal, have a lot of skin in this game. But, unlike the member for New England, we're not putting our head in the sand and pretending there's no issue here. We're not rejecting the science. We are not rejecting the very clear fact that renewables are now the cheapest form of energy in this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government's Powering Australia plan will deliver on our commitment to ensure not only that there are 600,000 new jobs in this new energy space but also that five out of every six of those new jobs are going to be in regions like mine that are currently carbon-intensive economies. It's regions like mine that have always been at the heart of energy generation and distribution in this nation, and we want to be at the heart of energy generation and distribution for generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an Albanese Labor government that is going to ensure that we have the opportunity to transform Newcastle into a renewable energy superpower. That is our future. We want to create safe, secure jobs. We want to cut power prices for our constituents, for families and for people who are currently paying through the nose for their energy in this country, and we want to reduce emissions in the process. That's why Labor's plan is to boost the percentage of renewables going into the grid by 82 per cent by 2030. We've already this week introduced into this parliament legislation to make electric vehicles cheaper, honouring another promise we made to the Australian people. We're set to install 400 community batteries and roll out 85 solar banks across Australia. That's because we don't want only the good homeowners of Australia to have access to cheap, affordable renewable energy; we actually want to benefit every Australian, including those who are in rentals who currently can't afford to get a foothold in the housing market. Why should they not benefit from cheaper, affordable renewable energy?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is mindful that we want all Australians to be able to take part in these renewable energy innovations and in the distribution of renewable energy across Australia. The people of Newcastle are absolutely ecstatic that there is finally a line being drawn in the sand to put an end to these bitter, destructive climate wars that have stopped action for the last decade. They know that it's time that we start the really serious work and, indeed, the heavy lifting of transforming our economies. The worst thing in the world to do to communities like mine is to pretend that there is nothing going on here: 'You can all just keep going. It's tickety-boo. Just keep doing what you're doing.' Then one day a decision is made in a boardroom far across the other side of the world which has profound impacts for communities like mine, which then means that we don't have a plan B in place, and we leave thousands of workers and their families hanging out to dry. That is not the Labor way; that is not what a Labor government will be doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Novocastrians, just like the business community and just like industry groups, know there is some hard, serious work to be done, and we want to take advantage of the opportunities that are going to come to regions like ours. We've got the highly skilled workforce. We've been generating power for more than a century. The workers in my electorate know more about power than anybody in this room, I can assure you. There's a highly skilled workforce, important key infrastructure in place and access to an electricity grid that is going to be vital in the transitioning of this nation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Offshore wind, utilising the new technology of floating turbines, is fast becoming a reality in Australia. I congratulate members opposite for putting up legislation during the last parliament, which we wholeheartedly supported, to ensure that we can actually have offshore wind in Australia. We are now going to make that a reality. It is regions like mine that stand to benefit enormously from those new opportunities. We are poised to be a prime location not just for the production of wind energy but also for the important manufacturing and fabrication of those wind turbines and for lots of wind projects across the country. That's the vision I have for Newcastle.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Newcastle and the Hunter are also rapidly becoming the centre of green hydrogen. There a lot of projects on the horizon. The Albanese Labor government is partnering with the University of Newcastle to invest $16 million in building a new facility that will invent and test solutions to a whole range of global challenges when it comes to the use of hydrogen and the many new energy technologies that are coming online. The skills, techniques and technologies developed by this project at the university will enable local industry—including hydrogen investments at the Port of Newcastle, for example—to reach their full potential. There has been a lot of thinking as to what will be required and what industry is going to need in terms of a skilled workforce but also the places to test out, accredit and ensure safety in the use of these new energy technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not blind to the challenges ahead; we are preparing for them. There are two green hydrogen projects set for Newcastle that the federal Labor government are going to be funding—$41 million each. One is with Origin and one is with the Port of Newcastle. I cannot wait to see them come online. It makes sense for our port to play a substantial role in Australia's bid to become a significant exporter of renewable energies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this limited time, I think it's important to remind the House that the Australian people had the opportunity to vote to end the climate wars, and that's what they did on 21 May for the first time in a decade. Now it's up to the Australian parliament to do the same.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:37</span>):  It is good to hear a reasonable voice from the Labor side. I will offer a slightly different view from Groom. We have always described ourselves as energy agnostic in our area. We have a wonderful thermal coalmine that we hope is about to start up again. We have gas. We have solar power. We have wind just on the verge. We have a hydro plant on the way. And we have had long discussions about hydrogen coming into the Toowoomba region. We do what works. That is our approach and it has worked very well for us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to the legislation—the Climate Change Bill 2022 and related bill—this is absolutely a triumph of politics over policy. The Prime Minister and minister have made very, very clear in repeated statements that this legislation is not necessary. It is entirely the government's right to set their targets, and they have done that. That work has been done. Targets have been set. Nothing that we debate here will change that or impact on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is this legislation about? For people in a regional community like mine, this legislation is about enabling projects to be killed by stealth. That is what this legislation enables. We have seen this in the UK. I'll refer to my time as a project manager delivering major projects very similar to these in the UK. We saw a high-speed tube, under the cover of legislation very similar to this, attacked by green lawfare trying to stop that project. It's amazing to think that the Greens would try to stop the biggest public transport project—in fact, the biggest project—going on in Europe at the moment. A massive public transport project is trying to be stopped. This legislation would enable that. We have seen them try to stop highway maintenance projects under cover of this sort of legislation. We have seen how important Heathrow's third runway is to the UK. Their entire economy relies upon their connection to Europe and the rest of the world yet we saw green lawfare trying to stop the runway under the cover of this sort of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does this mean for people in Groom? Let's think about the big projects coming our way. We have been fighting for years to get passenger rail from Brisbane to Toowoomba. That connection that we rely upon will make a huge difference to our economy, to our community. Under the cover of this legislation, green lawfare will try to stop that, I absolutely guarantee. Road maintenance—let's talk about the Gore Highway, the Warrego, the New England, all of which require significant ongoing maintenance. In the UK these things were challenged and tried to be stopped because they increased traffic movements. That is exactly what we would like to do, increase traffic movements on that because that is us getting our product to market. That is how a regional economy exists. Heaven forbid, the second road to Highfields, which is an incredibly important road project so vital for the growth of our region in Groom, is a project very similar to what was challenged in the UK. Again, if we want to expand the Wellcamp Airport, it would be able to be challenged by green lawfare under the cover of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I point out Green lawfare is not hypothetical to us in Groom. We have sat and watched for 15 years the New Acland coalmine be attacked by activists through the courts with the sole intent of stopping this coalmine. This is not hypothetical. We have watched this happen. We have watched the town of Oakey be stripped of investment, be stripped of jobs. We are watching our people leave and take jobs elsewhere. The local economy is suffering because of this approach, what I call it the Palaszczuk approach, where the Premier never has to say no herself but she just allows these projects to die a death of a thousand lawsuits at arm's length from her government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation that moves the targets from the executive powers to the legislative gives licence for the Prime Minister to do exactly the same. The Prime Minister will run the country the way that the Premier is running Queensland. For those in my patch, that's not a particularly good thing. When we look at what this approach is about, enabling this sort of lawfare, enabling things to be stopped by activists, removing executive power and executive judgement on these projects, it is about stopping things. It's about taking options off the table. It is about reducing emissions by reducing economic activity. So what we end up with is fewer things happening. In regional communities like ours that rely upon this significant infrastructure to keep us connected, to enable our industries, to enable our economy, what this means is we will see less of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I very much welcome the debate that others have raised here on nuclear energy. It enables a credible conversation about building our energy capacity, about facing our future energy needs. I very much welcome that conversation. It is something new, something challenging, and I acknowledge that. This debate has been frozen in time since the 1980s. It was over a generation ago that decisions were made about nuclear, back when Midnight Oil was still producing good albums, and those decisions may have been right at the time. I don't know, maybe they were right at the time. Maybe when there was no question about how much coal we should be using, these decisions were right. Maybe the cheapness of coal meant nuclear wasn't the right answer. But that situation is not the one we are facing today. When we are speaking about nuclear now we are speaking about today's technologies, new and emerging technologies, not Soviet-era reactors. We aren't back in the past with Ivan Drago; we're talking about what is happening now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed again today that the minister laughed at, scoffed and mocked the very idea of nuclear. Now, it was very clear that he made efforts to do that. It was a little bit of Kabuki theatre, I think, showing off just how much he thought this was a silly idea. Well, if the economics don't stack up, why are countries like France, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, the US and the UK adopting this technology? Why are they doubling down on it? If this is so laughable, why are these major countries that have similar commitments and that are reducing their emissions choosing this technology? There are two answers: either the minister knows something that they don't know, or they know something that the minister doesn't know. I'm going to go with the market on this one. I'm going to go with the market. That's just what my side tends to do. Market led decision-making tends to be the best in the long run.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a decision being made by modern economies to embrace this conversation. If there's anything that we can add to it, it's that if we want to have a credible position going forward then we need to have this conversation—and I acknowledge that it's challenging. But instead we tend to find ourselves here debating legislation that the Prime Minister himself has described as unnecessary. I strongly believe that we should be opening ourselves to a conversation on a credible energy policy that builds on this side of the House's legacy of a technology led approach and that safeguards those regional jobs with regional projects and regional people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's extraordinary that, within this short time into a new government, we're seeing a real divergence on energy policy. We're seeing the approach of stopping things, of taking options off the table, of staying with decisions on technologies from a generation ago—reducing emissions by reducing economic activity versus the approach on this side of the House, which is to open ourselves to a conversation about the latest technology, to open ourselves to what other major economies are doing around the world to address the challenges we face. I think that that decision will be very, very clear. We're willing to engage in it. We acknowledge the challenges that talking about nuclear brings. We acknowledge that technology is advancing every day that we delay this conversation. Technology continues to advance. But we are open to it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this legislation has highlighted anything, it's that having targets as your focus is one thing but that not being willing to engage in a conversation about the how of today is of no value to the Australian people. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  I know something about emergencies. I've been in a few in my time during my career as a frontline doctor. Rather than tell you what I do, let me tell you what I don't do. I don't stand around, hands in pocket, pontificating about, denying or delaying what is in front of me. I act, and I act with a team, with urgency and purpose. I also don't just do one thing. As a team, we do everything. Multiple interventions are deployed because that is exactly what an emergency demands. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a climate emergency. This is a position that the Labor Party has held since 2015. Our continent has warmed by 1.4 degrees, and we are living, as Churchill said, through the era of consequences that is indeed upon us. We are facing the prospect that parts of our country are becoming unliveable. This is a sobering and traumatising scenario for those communities. Imagine how they feel when they hear persistent rain on their roofs? I'm sure many of them cannot sleep at night. But it's not just the impacts on our land and our environment. There are individual impacts at a very personal level. As a doctor, I have seen climate anxiety manifest in young people, in older people and, indeed, in our elders—across the full spectrum of our population, particularly in Higgins. But something more is happening. I have seen this morph into something far more sinister: what can only be described as a lethal hopelessness. We talk a lot about imperatives. There is, indeed, an environmental imperative, there is an economic imperative, but there is also now a time imperative, and we have simply run out of time as a country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a local level, Higgins has been crying out for climate action. I heard that loud and clear when I was campaigning, and for too long those cries have fallen on deaf ears. The Australian Conservation Foundation in March performed a survey, and it revealed that over 70 per cent of people in Higgins believed that climate action would deliver both health and economic benefits—and do you know what? They're absolutely right. I want to acknowledge the work of the Higgins Climate Action Network and note their tireless activism over many, many years. They are the obsessive minority that helped drive change and tip the balance at this election. On 21 May, the Australian people transitioned away from the Liberal-National party towards a renewable energy future that will be delivered now by this progressive parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is a joyous day because today we end, finally, the climate wars. We end a decade of dithering inaction and incompetence and of 22 energy policies with the failure to land even one. I have with me this document, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Powering Australia</span> plan. This plan was an inert document yesterday, but, thanks to the efforts of this parliament, we have breathed life into this plan—into this inert document—and now this plan will deliver a completely different future for Australians, young and old. It is a day to rejoice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill itself delivers on the government's election commitment to restore national leadership on climate change by legislating our targets to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent on 2005 figures by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. It is an important opportunity also for this Australian parliament to affirm the long-held wish of our people that we indeed commit to net zero. The Climate Change Bill 2022 legislates the 2030 and 2050 targets consistent with the nationally determined contributions that we submitted to the United Nations on 16 June. We set a cracking pace from the very beginning. It enhances our accountability and transparency, and this is important because climate integrity is so important. We're about to spend billions and billions of taxpayer dollars, as well as private investment, and we need to wrap probity and integrity around everything we do. So there will be an annual statement to parliament on our climate progress, delivered by the minister. In addition to this, we have empowered our agencies to do what they need to do and what has been denied to them. The Climate Change Authority will provide impartial, independent advice to the parliament and to our government. We have also baked in a regular independent review of the act to ensure that it is fit for purpose as we go forward. We have empowered our agencies to focus on turbocharging clean energy. These include the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, known as ARENA, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and Export Finance Australia. And, finally, we will be returning a voice to our peak scientific body, the CSIRO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is outside the remit of this bill but is relevant to its progress and its activation in our country is that we, as a government, are also addressing the bottlenecks—and these are really important to understand. There are three: (1) skills, (2) industrial capability and (3) workforce participation. If we do not address these bottlenecks, we will not get to our destination. With respect to skills, we have a plan. We are going to introduce 45,000 free TAFE places, 10,000 of which are focused on energy apprenticeships. I hope that our young people, men and women, sign up to these in droves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industrial capability: in 2000, Australia was ranked No. 60 out 133 countries by Harvard's economic complexity index, an objective marker of industrial capability and know-how. We are currently No. 91. We have gone backwards in 22 years. So we have a lot of work to do to bring back onshore manufacturing. We're going to do that through our National Reconstruction Fund, a $15 billion enterprise designed to bring high-tech manufacturing back to Australia so that we actually make those batteries. And I hope that one day we make electric vehicles here. We currently sell our lithium, for example, for A$60,000 per tonne and we buy it back as an $80,000 to $100,000 electric vehicle. There is nothing stopping us, except our own imagination, from making these products here, the kinds of products that Australians are desperate for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So today we turn the flywheel, and this flywheel will spin faster and faster over the next eight years. But, as it turns, market forces will take over and it will mean that we not only reach that interim target but indeed, I am confident, exceed it. Australia is a prodigal child that has returned to the fold. Today is one of the happiest days of my life, because I can say with confidence to the people of Higgins that the Albanese Labor government and this parliament—and I thank the crossbench—is acting with purpose and urgency on climate.</span>

The Greens and crossbenchers who pushed for no new coal and gas saw their votes go up. Liberal and Labor, who want more coal and gas, saw their votes go backwards.

The International Energy Agency believes it's time. The Pacific islands leaders believe it's time. Thousands of young climate strikers believe it's time. Even the Pope believes it's time! But this Labor government seems to believe something different. Labor seems to believe that we can keep approving more coal and gas, and that the market will make the call when it's time to stop. Labor wouldn't leave the minimum wage or aged-care nurse ratios to the market to decide, so it shouldn't do it with the future of humanity either. It's the government's job to keep people safe, not to defend the profits of Santos and Woodside. Worse, the current Prime Minister, channelling the former Prime Minister, says that our coal is somehow better for the climate. It is not. You can't put the fire out while pouring more petrol on it. You can only end the climate wars by keeping coal and gas in the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now there are 114 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline. If they go ahead, more homes and businesses will become uninsurable. If we hit two or more degrees of warming and fail to meet the Paris Agreement goals, which is where this government's weak targets take us, we will see more floods, fires and droughts. They will increase the cost of living and destroy infrastructure. Ecosystems will collapse, more species will simply become extinct and more of us will die. That is why, when negotiating on this Climate Change Bill, we've put such an emphasis not just on the government's weak targets but on the need for a moratorium on new coal and gas. We also said that there needed to be compromise and real action and that our preference was to improve and pass the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this parliament, where less than a third of the country voted for Labor—yes, Labor has some mandate and the Greens have some mandate, but more important is our mandate from the planet and the laws of physics. If the government continues to open up new coal and gas the planet will burn, and that is the mandate we need to listen to. That is why we're bitterly disappointed that Labor have made it clear publicly over the last few weeks that they want to continue to open new coal and gas projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government has been unwilling to adopt science based targets and place a moratorium on new coal and gas, we have been able to secure improvements to the bill—ensuring that the target can be ratcheted up over time and that it's now 'Dutton-proofed' with a genuine floor, which means the target cannot go backwards. Changes have also been made to put in place greater transparency and accountability and to strengthen requirements on the Climate Change Authority. Government agencies, such as Export Finance Australia, that in the past have funded coal and gas projects will, for the first time, be forced to take climate targets into account, which would see them curbed from supporting fossil fuels. They join a range of other agencies with new limits, including Infrastructure Australia and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. That is why we will vote for this bill tomorrow and we will vote for it in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be crystal clear, the Greens have improved a weak climate bill and we will pass it. But the fight to stop Labor's new coal and gas mines continues. In this parliament the only obstacle to stronger climate action is Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People need to be clear-eyed about the importance of this bill and that this government is bringing a bucket of water to a house fire. Worse—even this smallest of steps along the road to tackling the climate emergency could be wiped out by just one of the 114 new coal and gas projects in the government's investment pipeline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate inquiry will be critical, as we expect the Senate inquiry will show that the government cannot meet the targets in this legislation if it opens new coal and gas projects and that a change to the government's approach will be required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Beetaloo gas project alone could lift Australia's pollution by up to 13 per cent. And if all of the coal, oil and gas projects on the books go ahead Australia's pollution could rise by as much as a third from where we are now. None of this is included in Labor's modelling around the weak 43 per cent. Here we Greens have the science, the public and the international community on our side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor might be holding out now, but their position is ultimately untenable. They can't go to upcoming climate summits vowing to open new coal and gas projects and expect to be taken seriously. Soon the government will start to say how it will cut pollution, putting some meat on the bones of its centrepiece safeguard mechanism, which may reduce pollution by as little as one per cent a year and ignite new climate wars if it allows new coal and gas projects to proceed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens, in balance of power in the Senate, will be crucial, as the safeguard mechanism can be disallowed. I can also inform the House that, because the safeguard mechanism will deal with the question of new coal and gas projects, the government will have further discussion with the Greens as it designs the mechanism. Further, the government will also consider Greens proposals to support coal and gas workers and communities, including the establishment of a transition authority. This was a crucial part of our election campaign. This has to be the parliament that provides job and wage security to coal and gas workers as we do our part to tackle the climate challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the next six to 12 months the battle will be fought on a number of fronts. We will comb the entire budget for any public money, any subsidies, handouts or concessions going to fossil fuel corporations, and we'll amend the budget to remove them. We will push to ensure the safeguard mechanism safeguards our future by stopping new coal and gas projects. We'll push for a climate trigger in our environment laws, and we will continue to fight individual projects around the country, like in Beetaloo, Scarborough and Barossa. I call on all Australians to join this battle to save our country, our communities and, indeed, our whole civilisation from the climate and environment crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of the consequential bill, there are many important agencies and acts of parliament not currently included in the consequential bill. The Greens believe that all of government should be working towards the legislated climate target. I understand from the minister that a review will be conducted in the coming months of other agencies and acts to be added to the list in the consequential bill. In summing up on this bill, I ask the minister to confirm that this review will take place and what the timing of this review will be. I would also like the minister to confirm that NOPSEMA, the agency tasked with regulating and approving offshore oil and gas projects, and its governing legislation will also be included in this review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a related matter, while the consequential bill includes the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 and inserts the targets into that act, it does not directly address the problem of native forest burning being counted as renewable energy. This problem was created by the Abbott government. It needs to be addressed. I ask the minister to confirm that we're going to have further discussions on this very important matter.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">PHILLIPS</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:06</span>):  What a momentous day. I could not be more proud to stand here tonight in support of the Climate Change Bill 2022. After a decade of inaction, we might finally see our country start to seize all the opportunities our transition to a renewable energy future has to offer. We will finally take meaningful action to address climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this will be welcome in my electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast, because climate change isn't something that will maybe, perhaps, happen in the future; it is something that is happening right now, and it is something that has happened that we are experiencing. My electorate has been directly impacted by the last decade of inaction on climate change. What does a change in climate mean? It means more extreme weather. And, boy, have we had some extreme weather. Just in my time as member for Gilmore in the last three years, my electorate has been severely hurt by drought. We have been severely hurt by record-breaking bushfires. We have been severely hurt by a seemingly never-ending sequence of disaster declared floods, one after another. Our communities are seeing climate change firsthand. They are feeling the hurt and the impacts on our health right now. They are seeing environmental degradation from these disasters to an ecosystem that can barely cope and will have trouble renewing after such devastating loss and damage. The <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment</span> report that the minister released only recently shows that the 2019-20 bushfires have had a lasting impact on our environment and our biodiversity, and it is struggling to bounce back. Local people in my electorate don't need to be told that. They see it every single day, and they want something done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our communities want us to take action now to help them better prepare for these events. They want to be made more resilient, with an energy system that can withstand challenges—things like community batteries like the one I promised at Maloneys Beach. During the bushfires, so much of the South Coast lost power altogether. It's one of the biggest anxieties I hear from people about our disaster preparedness. What happens when the power goes out? It's not just about keeping the lights on; when the power goes out, all too often communications aren't far behind. We lose landlines and sometimes we lose mobile phone reception. Even if we don't lose reception, if the power stays out, eventually the mobile phones will go out too. We need batteries to help provide that resilience and that security. So I'm excited to deliver that battery for Maloneys Beach, and I hope to work on even more batteries across the South Coast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the point is that the people of my electorate have had enough of the wasted opportunities. What do they want to see? They want to see us power Australia. They want to see the New South Wales South Coast become a renewable energy powerhouse, and so do I. That is why I am so excited today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something the Liberals always seem to forget when they try to paint Labor's climate policies as some kind of boogieman, some kind of pie-in-the-sky fantasy, and the 'oh so scary' green agenda. What they forget is that this is about energy. This is about the absolute abundance of renewable energy opportunity that we have here in Australia that we are wasting—that we have wasted for a decade. The Albanese Labor government wants to stop that waste, and our Powering Australia plan will do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill enshrines our 43 per cent target to reduce emissions on 2005 levels by 2030, and achieve net zero by 2050. We hope—and I'm sure from the work I have seen in my electorate already—that the commitments of our industries, of our communities, will have us see even greater reductions than this. But the modelling that we have done shows this is what our policies will achieve. It's a mighty goal, and I am proud of it. Under this bill, by 2030, more than 82 per cent of the electricity we consume will be generated by renewable energy. And we will see the jobs that come with that in our renewable energy economy. That is my focus: the jobs. That's what my electorate needs and wants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do we take advantage of those job opportunities? We start by training the workforce. I was a TAFE teacher, so I know how crucial education is. Our plan will spend $100 million to train 10,000 new energy apprentices in the jobs of the future. Our $10 million New Energy Skills Program will help to provide additional training pathways. And our investments in education and TAFE will also make a huge impact here. Young people in my community need support. They need to know they can live, learn and work without having to move to the cities. That's what I am working towards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a bit about the opportunities I am most excited about for my electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast. I want the South Coast to become a renewable energy powerhouse. And I am going to work every single day with the ministers, with the community, with industry, with businesses, to get this done. Interestingly, I recently received an email from Kenneth in Culburra Beach. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a Culburra Beach property owner, I have been advocating for the installation of an EV charging station in this popular seaside town. As it is only 180 kilometres from Sydney and 211 kilometres from Canberra it is well within the range of an electric vehicle but not near enough to return on one charge. A charging station would be an excellent investment for the town encouraging sustainably minded tourists to visit in the knowledge they could recharge for travelling around the area and return. I do hope you can support the proposal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Kenneth, under the Albanese government, we will finally have Australia's first national electric vehicle strategy. We will double the existing investment in electric vehicle charging and establish hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, up to $500 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Shoalhaven actually is home to an electric charging station already at the Silos Estate in Berry. Owner Raj told me it's actually the biggest charging station in Australia—one mean feat. They have 16 charging units, with 12 that are superchargers. These can recharge an electric car in 20 minutes. What is one of the best things that comes from the chargers? Tourists. Being a winery, this is a win-win for Raj, but it is also a boon for our economy. After years of natural disasters and COVID-19 that have kept tourists away, it is amazing to think that these renewable energy ideas could also help drive our tourism industry. Batemans Bay, in the south of my electorate, also has an electric vehicle charging station. With our investment, we can see these charging stations in even more locations, creating the electric vehicle superhighway we need to move people up and down the coast and around Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate on the New South Wales South Coast also has a fabulous manufacturing industry. But that industry has been crying out for more investment, crying out for help to transition to a cleaner energy future. I'm excited to see the opportunities our $3 billion investment in the new National Reconstruction Fund will create for our community. This fund will support renewables, manufacturing and low-emissions technology. The South Coast has proven we want to, and will, innovate. I have spoken many times in this place about the biogas plant that local dairy farmers are helping establish. It's an exciting project, and I want to see more of them. Now there will be energy policy certainty to support those ideas. There are many fantastic ideas out there in our community on the South Coast, just itching for investment, just waiting for a government that will take them seriously and give this country some energy policy certainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, I held a climate change forum. The Southcoast Health and Sustainability Alliance, affectionately known as SHASA, is one of the groups that were at that forum. They have been doing simply amazing work in this space for years, taking great advantage of the bits-and-bobs grants that have been available. Their focus has been on making the Eurobodalla more resilient, and they have helped to retrofit six community facilities into heatwave and bushfire havens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan will see $300 million for community batteries and solar banks across Australia. We can support organisations like SHASA and Repower Shoalhaven, and we can supercharge it. SHASA have been busy indeed because, as I said, they have also partnered with Repower Shoalhaven to propose a pilot program of renewables and electrification of the Shoalhaven and Eurobodalla. These groups want to create jobs, they want to invest in renewables, and they want to provide power savings for local households. There are many groups that support our Powering Australia plan. We have to get on with it. I commend this bill to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:16</span>):  I see part of my role as the member for Brisbane as being to raise the voices of those who often feel unheard. For a bill on climate change, it seemed appropriate to give a voice to young people. I'd like to bring attention to the words of Mirah Larkin and Grace Vegesana, two young members of the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, who today delivered letters from young activists to Parliament House. Eighteen-year-old Mirah said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Young people across Australia are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. The letters we have brought to Parliament today for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese are filled with the stories of young people facing bushfires, flooding, and heat waves. But young people are resilient, we are hopeful and we're not going to stop demanding bold, ambitious climate action from our political representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty-three-year-old Grace said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Millions of people voted for action on climate change this election, and now the Albanese Government needs to tackle the number one cause of the climate crisis by ending coal and gas expansion. We do not need any new coal mines or gas wells to transition to 100% renewable energy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's young people who will feel the greatest impacts from the decisions that we make on this important bill, the Climate Change Bill 2022. We're seeing a growing trend of the increasing politicisation of the youth of Australia, which is great to see. Increasing engagement of new youth leaders in our political system is not just beneficial; it's essential. However, I can't help but reflect on what has led to the trend. The mobilisation of so many youth voices is a direct consequence of decades of inaction on climate change, failing social justice policies and a cost-of-living crisis. It's people like Mirah and Grace whose views we should be foregrounding when we consider the lifelong effects of the decisions we make in this place and how they will impact current and future generations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all should know, the effects of climate change will be felt worldwide and in our local communities. At the local level, my electorate of Brisbane recently suffered a cataclysmic climate event. Maiwar, the Brisbane River, has long been a symbol of our city's beauty. But, as the planet warms, it becomes more and more of a danger to us. In the most recent flooding, parts of our city that had never flooded before were completely underwater. Not just the Brisbane River but the inner brooks and creeks, which define many parts of my electorate, flooded and caused devastating damage to local communities. We've been told that these are once-in-a-lifetime events, despite this being the third such event within the lives of many of the residents of Brisbane. These once-in-a-lifetime events will only increase in severity and frequency, and the people of Brisbane know this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the course of our election campaign, climate change was far and away the most commonly raised issue by people that we spoke to in our community. And that was before the floods of February and March of this year. I recently met with constituents who live in the Brisbane suburb of Stafford, who were, and continue to be, impacted by these floods. They told me about entire metres of land on their properties being washed away into the Kedron Brook, a creek which usually resembles a walking track with a small stream parting both sides. As sediment built up along the stream, the water rose higher and higher, forcing people to flee their homes without knowing what would happen to them. A floating restaurant, destroyed in the 2011 floods and never properly repaired, washed onto the riverbank and destroyed a whole section of the riverside bikeway. Entire swathes of the suburb of Milton were completely submerged. The Toombul shopping centre—while outside my electorate—is used by thousands of residents of Brisbane, and it was damaged so badly that it was not able to reopen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were told by volunteers at the Northey Street City Farm that the office building they had built—specifically above the 1974 flood line—was, in this flood, almost completely inundated with floodwater. But our communities are resilient. People across the electorate opened their homes and their hearts, and did everything they could to help rebuild their communities in the wake of catastrophe. The kindness and generosity of these people continues to give me hope for the future. But we should not have been in this situation. We should not have had to experience a disaster fuelled by climate inaction. We should not have to rely on the resilience of the community to rebuild every single time one of these climate induced disasters occurs. It is our responsibility in this place to ensure that we take the climate action that is needed to prevent this crisis becoming even worse. We are running out of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Something that we need to remember when we discuss this issue is that the measures we're taking are not reversing climate change. The time to stop exacerbating global warming is long gone. After almost a decade of government inaction—in our country, which is one of the worst polluters in the world—we missed our chance to stop climate change in its tracks. This is the frankly depressing reality that we now find ourselves in. Cataclysmic weather events are occurring with increasing frequency and severity, and they're going to continue. All we can hope to do now is prevent climate change from getting any worse. If we want to have any hope of preserving natural wonders like the Great Barrier Reef, to have the chance to build infrastructure which can withstand worsening climate events, and give current and future generations the best chance of survival, we need to start right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting this bill is a first step towards that. I'm glad to see some action on the most pressing issue of our time, but what we really need to do is stop new coal and gas. As long as we keep opening new coalmines and new gas fields, we are making the climate crisis worse. The Greens will keep pushing the government to take this step, which is crucial for the survival of all of us and our planet—and we cannot lose hope. What gives me hope is that people from across this country, and especially young people, are motivated and are ready to fight. They know that this is not the end of the road for addressing climate change; it is just the beginning. We have many battles ahead of us, and much of the hill still to climb. We need a moratorium on new coal and gas projects. We need to put people before the profits of BHP and Santos. We need to end the billions in taxpayer handouts that the fossil fuel industry receives. The real fight starts now. Climate activists are ready. Young people are ready. The community is ready, and we are ready.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMT" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  I rise to welcome and support the Climate Change Bill. The Climate Change Bill 2022 is a tangible demonstration by this Labor government that it has been, and is, serious about meeting its election commitments on climate change. While we have plenty to do, we're not prepared to waste any more time, and we have begun this process as of today. There's been a tendency, amongst some commentators who like to oversimplify the hopes and aspirations of the Australian people, to present the climate change debate as one which divides Australians on class lines. There is a view that the demand for climate change action is somehow the preserve of the affluent and the privileged, that only those who have the time and money beyond their day-to-day survival care about so-called bigger picture issues like climate change. I can confirm that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, in my electorate of Calwell, where the struggle to find secure work, affordable housing and enough money to pay the bills is real, people are also acutely aware of and deeply concerned about the future of our planet. In reality, it is not a case of jobs versus climate, or coal versus renewables, or economic growth versus a healthy planet. My constituents understand that a good government can and should tackle all these issues in a balanced and compassionate way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have an incredible number of very diverse linguistic and cultural communities in my electorate, and for many of them action on climate change is a very high priority. It's as much a high priority as it is in other parts of the country. In particular, I speak of the Fijian and the other South Pacific island communities, who have stressed to me, time and time again, the very real and immediate threat that unmitigated climate change poses to their birthplaces, where many of their extended families still reside. Rising sea level, floods and fires are very real and present dangers to these communities as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of providing secure and stable settings for investment in renewable energy is not lost on my electorate in terms of jobs and new industry. This bill will provide a coherent policy to accelerate investment in renewable energy, transmission and storage. As the minister has noted, it is vital that we send a message to the private sector, who have wanted to invest in renewable energy but have held back because of a lack of clear signals from the previous government. The government's target, as outlined by the minister, is to reach 82 per cent renewable energy in our electricity system by 2030. Firmed renewables are the cheapest form of energy, and getting more renewables into the system will put downward pressure on power prices, while also reducing Australia's emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current cost of living is a huge concern to my constituents. Two of the most expensive but essential items on the family budget are, of course, power and petrol. The previous government's inaction on climate change did absolutely nothing to protect our environment, but it also did nothing to arrest the escalating cost of essential resources. The only way to ensure equitable and affordable access to power in the future is through policy settings that will help develop the whole-scale transition to renewable energy sources. I acknowledge, as many of us do, that this will take time, but that just makes it all the more urgent to put these policy settings into place right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Petrol is another issue entirely, and one I won't go into now, but the National Electric Vehicle Strategy, which is part of our suite of climate change policies, will hopefully help in the long run to reduce our reliance on this contentious and polluting commodity. Once the home of automotive manufacturing, Calwell is keen to embrace new car technology when it is a realistic and affordable option. I hope that that day comes very soon. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly welcome this bill. I welcome the Labor government's genuine commitment to taking urgent yet considered action on reducing emissions and steering this capable and innovative nation to a strong economy based on renewable energy. I also urge us to remain true to our equally strong commitment to social justice. Transition is necessary but must always be managed in a way that doesn't leave disadvantaged communities behind. I believe the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, whose electorate is not unlike my own, has a thorough understanding of the issues of equity. Justice, equity and climate change are the three most urgent and pressing issues of our time, and I support the bill as the first step amongst many that this government will pursue to tackle these issues.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:28</span>):  One degree of warming—that is where we're at now, although, frankly, from the support that both the two major parties of this country give to the coal and gas industry, you wouldn't think it. You'd be led to believe we have all the time in the world. We don't. I said in my first speech last week that the arrival of my grandchildren spurred me into more direct political action. I want to speak up for their future, and everyone's. My beautiful grandkids are seven and nine years old. Without real, deep and rapid cuts to emissions, without a halt on new coal and gas projects, and a phasing-out of existing coal and gas, what world will they inherit? One degree of warming—at one degree of warming we already have unprecedented heatwaves and wildfires across large parts of Europe and the US. London reached 40 degrees. In mid-May, India hit 49 degrees, the highest temperature India has recorded in 122 years. At one degree of warming, we're already seeing climate disasters affecting crop production and fuelling inflation. And, of course, at one degree of warming, we have major flooding events at ever-increased frequency across Australia's east coast. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the floods earlier this year, parts of my electorate of Ryan were inundated and in Indooroopilly, tragically, one person drowned. We saw damage to homes, businesses and public facilities in many parts of the electorate, disrupting lives and livelihoods. Even areas far from the Brisbane River were affected, such as Mitchelton's million-dollar, all-weather football field and homes in Ashgrove and at Enoggera Creek. Between breakfast time and midnight on 25 February, Moggill Creek in Kenmore rose by nearly four metres, inundating Kenmore high school's oval, sweeping away years of creekside revegetation works, submerging tennis courts and lapping at the school's buildings much higher up the hillside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in Ryan it was not only those with direct damage from floodwater who were affected. The suburbs of Moggill, Bellbowrie, Pullenvale, parts of Pinjarra Hills and neighbouring areas were, effectively, isolated for days because of their dependence on a single arterial road: Moggill Road, which flooded at four points. The closure of the Moggill Ferry service because of the river conditions compounded the lack of access. Because their only route into the rest of the city was impossible, normal life was disrupted for thousands of residents and the delivery of food, medicines and other essentials was interrupted. Health and aged-care workers could not reach their places of work, exacerbating already problematic staff shortages and COVID absences. About 1,000 secondary school students were unable to reach their schools. The supermarket in Moggill began to run out of fresh food. But for the efforts of a GP sleeping on his surgery floor in Bellbowrie, even urgent primary health care would not have been available to many. Pregnant women had to be rowed across floodwater to reach the hospital and some schoolchildren stranded on the wrong side of the inundated area were separated from their parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ryan was not the only electorate affected in our city, as the members for Brisbane and Griffith will attest. That flood came only a decade after the last so-called unprecedented flood in Brisbane. That's one degree of warming. That's the world my grandchildren already live in. They haven't known anything else. So what happens at 1.5 degrees of warming? We'll see an exponential increase in the frequency and severity of bushfires, floods, heatwaves and droughts, leading to loss of life and livelihood and mass forced migration from countries going underwater or whose economies are collapsing under the strain of crop failures. Do we really think that, once we are seeing rolling extreme weather events, the inflation due to supply-side shocks that we're seeing now will ever go away? How often will the people of Ryan experience major flooding events at 1.5 degrees of warming? How much more severe will they be? That could be as soon as the end of this decade. My two grandchildren will be 15 and 17. How much longer then till we reach two degrees of warming? That's likely by mid-century. My grandchildren will be in their 40s and 50s. What will that world look like?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to find out what that future looks like, all we need to do is wait, because currently there are enough new coal and gas projects in the pipeline in Australia to blow well through our carbon budget and take us to that two- or even three-degree warming world. Forty-three per cent emissions reduction by 2030 is not enough, but, with the ratchet mechanism negotiated by the Greens, we may, over the next few years, be able to get it to 75 per cent by 2030 and, ultimately, to 100 per cent by 2035, which is in line with what is actually needed. The Greens will fight every step of the way to get there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's also easy to be distracted by targets, and I fear a lot of this debate has been distracting us from the bigger issue, and that issue is new coal and gas. We cannot overstate the problem here: if all of the coal and gas projects currently in the pipeline go ahead, they will produce 30 times—that's right, 30 times—the emissions that the 43 per cent target will cut. Even if we exclude the emissions produced by burning this coal and gas overseas—and why should we?—these new coal and gas projects will still produce triple the emissions that the 43 per cent target will cut. Thanks to Ketan Joshi and the Australia Institute for those figures. New coal and gas projects will not only wipe out the emissions reductions of this bill but lead to Australia's emissions increasing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's really clear here, and it shouldn't need to be said, is that you cannot say you're trying to solve the problem while actively making it worse. This is common sense and this is understood by the people in my electorate and by people across Australia, but this basic common sense seems to be lacking among many members of this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who benefits when we're distracted from the issue of new coal and gas? Glencore, BHP, Santos, Adani, Woodside—these vampire-like corporations are all salivating at the prospect of the billions in profits that can be made by opening up new coal and gas projects in this country, robbing the nation of its wealth while driving the climate crisis. To get a sense of how much power these corporations have, during the past seven years, five of the gas industry's biggest corporations have earned about $138 billion in revenue in Australia without paying a cent in corporate income tax. Just let that sink in. Who benefits from us being distracted from coal and gas? It's these huge multinationals, many of whom are donors to the Labor and Liberal parties. But who suffers from this distraction? My grandchildren, your children and grandchildren, everyday people whose homes get submerged in severe floods, everyday people whose whole lives get upturned by bushfires ripping through their communities, and everyday people whose cost of living goes through the roof because of repeated crop failures and supply chain disruptions from severe weather events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The solutions are there: stop new coal and gas, disaster-proof our cities and phase out existing coal and gas while building new industries in publicly owned renewables, green steel and manufacturing. The prosperity that can come from this is absolutely enormous, but we have to break the stranglehold that fossil fuel corporations hold over our political system. I invite members of the Labor Party to have the courage to help us in the Greens break that stranglehold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, with the ratchet mechanism negotiated by the Greens, might—and I stress 'might'—represent the beginning of a genuine approach towards the deep and urgent emissions reductions that Australia needs. But that all depends on the government's steps over the next three years. Will Labor continue to back new coal and gas and wipe out even the lowball emissions reductions of 43 per cent? Will they continue to listen to their fossil fuel corporate donors handing them billions in public money? Or will they back everyday people? Will they back our grandkids and their grandkids? The current rhetoric from the government does not give one a lot of hope. But what does give one hope is that everyday Australians do want change. This election showed it. Whether politicians in this building like it or not, they must make that change, or the Australian people will replace them with people who are willing to do so.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:38</span>):  I rise to speak on the Climate Change Bill 2022. Bringing people together is what the Albanese government is all about. We're about bringing together those millions of Australians who want sensible, lasting action on climate change. We're about bringing together the states, the territories, investors, businesses, unions, the community and, with this legislation, parliamentarians. We're about together delivering the strongest and most ambitious climate policy to ever become law of this land. This is what we achieve when we do work together. This is the message we send to our communities across Australia—that we can work together and we can, after a wasted decade, get moving once again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the message we send about Australia across the globe. We send the message that Australia will be a renewable energy superpower. We deliver this legislation by working together, consulting widely and, in one of many changes from the previous government, we are not only consulting a committee of one, the member for New England; we have consulted across the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to support this legislation and the sensible amendments which enable us to deliver on Labor's election platform—including the amendment from the member for Curtin, which sensibly states that we will ensure that we are 'drawing on the best available scientific knowledge'. It's very sensible, and I commend the member for Curtin for that amendment. And I'm pleased that the Albanese Labor government is delivering on our commitment to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say I respect the opposition for honouring their commitments: their commitment to denial, their commitment to making it a full decade of inaction, their commitment to those nine wasted years and all of the policy chaos that they choose to continue, and their commitment to an obsession with nuclear power. Their commitment goes all the way back to when they elected a leader of the Liberal Party who believed that climate change was 'absolute crap'. Their commitment means they now have a leader who—I'll quote from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>: 'Peter Dutton jokes with Tony Abbott about rising sea levels in Pacific nations'. Their commitment means they had a deputy prime minister who said that the Pacific islands will survive the climate crisis because they 'pick our fruit'—that's real commitment there! Their commitment means that they have chosen a leader now, in the Leader of the Opposition, who was described by former Prime Minister Turnbull as leading an 'insurgency' against him and leading an extraordinary 'madness'. And, if you think that's all in the past, I'm sorry to say that I see an article in the Oz from today, 3 August, that says, 'There is a new climate war looming around the Liberal Party.' So I give them full marks for consistency in their climate denialism. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, despite the opposition, today it has become clear that the Climate Change Bill will pass both chambers of parliament, creating jobs, reducing emissions and delivering on the promise that was made to the people of Australia at the election on 21 May. I think it's really worth noting—and I will conclude with these points, because I want to see this bill become the law of the land, and that means that some of us might have to cut our speeches a little short—that there is one very simple reason why we can put this legislation through the parliament: communities across Australia chose to change who they sent to this place, including communities across Western Australia, where the member for Burt and I campaigned incredibly strongly to make sure that Western Australia sent people who wanted action on climate change and wanted legislation passed through this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've sat in this place and listened to incredibly inspiring speeches from new members. I won't quote them all, but I will quote the member for Swan; it is great to have the member for Swan now serving her community in this place. In a beautiful speech about climate change, she put it so simply when she said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Climate action is good for people, the community, the environment and the economy … We've had the climate election. The climate war is over. Climate ambition is back!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a brilliant speech. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the member for Hasluck ask what Australia will look like in 20 years time on the basis of the decisions we made in this, the 47th Parliament. She said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An Australia that can look back over 20 years of sure action on climate change and be proud, and more than a little relieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the member for Pearce give a brilliant speech, in which she talked about her strong community values and the sense that she is here as the community of Pearce, in all its colour and vibrancy, representing them so brilliantly in this place. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am proud that our government has a strategy and target of achieving net zero by 2050. It is an investment in our local and global futures.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so true, and I commend the member for Pearce for that speech. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for our other fabulous new Western Australian colleague, the member for Tangney, we'll have to wait until September for his first speech, but I'm looking forward to it. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude with this. This bill is what the people of Perth have been calling for. This bill is what the people of Perth have sent me to vote for. This bill, and the policies within it, I've consulted on with the now minister in forums in my electorate, and I'm proud to support this legislation becoming the law of Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300121" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHANDLER-MATHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:44</span>):  In my first speech I said it was clear that big corporations and billionaires run parliament. Well, it has become clear over the course of these months negotiating with the government that Labor is so committed to a weak target, so committed to the profit margins of coal and gas corporations, it is willing to let its entire climate legislative agenda fail just to protect their profits. I've been thinking a lot about why that makes me so angry, apart from the obvious, and I think it has become clear over the course of today, watching the speeches, that the real disgrace is that the government and the opposition know. They know the consequences of their actions. They know the human environmental devastation wrought by climate change. They know that people have died and will continue to die in floods, heatwaves, droughts, terrible natural disasters and storms. They know the massive crop failures, the displacement of billions of people, the death of the Great Barrier Reef. They know the consequences of their actions. But, given the choice between ordinary everyday people and billionaires like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer, they chose the profit margins of billionaires. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is really deeply distressing is that we know who will pay as a result of this. When the floods hit in Brisbane earlier this year, and we spent the week going from house to house to house with ordinary everyday people, volunteers, cleaning out people's flood-ravaged homes, time and again it was poor, working-class renters—people who had almost nothing—whose possessions we dragged from under their house. Time and again, we knew that the reason we were dragging their stuff from under their house, the reason they didn't have enough money to replace their basic possessions, the reason they knew they'd be sleeping on a friend's couch for the next three weeks because they didn't have another home to move into was that, time and again, is that the profit margins of fossil fuel corporations are chosen over the lives of ordinary people. We know there are gas corporations in this country right now who are making billions of dollars in profit and not paying a single cent in tax—not a single cent! There are workers who work for those corporations who pay more tax than the CEOs and the owners of those corporations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the only reason this bill has anything of substance in it is the nearly two million people who voted for the Greens at this election—the thousands of people who knocked on doors, delivered leaflets in letterboxes, helped clean up after the floods, staffed polling booths and built this Greens movement. My message to you is, while this is still not enough, clearly, your power is not yet fully realised. We know we've got a long way to go. We know that we'll manage to ensure that this bill is Dutton proofed. We know now that 43 per cent is just a minimum target. We know there is the potential to ratchet it up over time. We know now that we've made it harder for coal and gas projects to be approved, now that we've included some government agencies in the target. We know there'll be greater transparency. And we know that, finally, the government's at least willing to talk to us about supporting coal and gas communities. That our negotiations had to include the need to talk about supporting coal and gas communities with a transition authority is all you need to know about the contents of those negotiations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've improved a weak bill, but, of course, when you're fighting the coal and gas industry and their political representatives, you don't win overnight. Australia remains the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels in the world, and, with 114 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline, it's only going to get worse. Indeed, just one of these new coal and gas projects could wipe out the very small reductions achieved by this bill. As the member for Melbourne said, the government's position is completely untenable, even within the realms and terms of their own debate. Let's be very clear: one of the biggest lies in Australian politics, as I've said again and again, is that the major parties support new coal and gas because they care about workers. If that was the case, if they really cared about workers, they wouldn't be also passing the stage 3 tax cuts that will cost $224 billion. If they cared about workers, they wouldn't be allowing gas corporations to walk off with our wealth and take it overseas to the shareholders in Switzerland and France and wherever else these billionaires and shareholders live. If they really cared, a coal and gas worker wouldn't be paying more tax than the multinationals they work for. If that were the case, the government wouldn't be arriving to a budget in one of the worst cost-of-living crises in our history, where people are being evicted onto the street because there's no home to move into because the government hasn't built enough homes either at a state or federal level for decades now—and they wouldn't be about to spend billions of dollars on the subsidies for the coal and gas corporations who happen to also be destroying our lives. I am sick—already!—after two weeks of being in this place, of being told again and again that we have to be reasonable. 'Come on, tone it down a little bit'—as if I have to be calm and reasonable when I think about the millions of lives that will be destroyed as a result of decisions that are too often made in this place. God, I'm already so sick of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is that there is an alternative: massive investment in publicly owned renewable energy; massive investment in new industries; and taxing those coal and gas operations as they phase out over the next 10 years and using that to invest in public schools, hospitals and infrastructure like public pools, new public parks and beautifully designed public housing. The wealth in this country exists to make sure that we can not only phase out coal and gas but ensure that everyone has a chance to be alive in the sunshine. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to finish on this. If there was one thing this election demonstrated it is that when ordinary people work together, knock on people's doors, organise in their communities and offer that alternative vision of making sure that everyday people are put first, we win. The results in Griffith, Brisbane and Ryan and the member for Melbourne's seat of Melbourne demonstrate that, when we get organised on that platform, we win. That is a line in the sand. That is a message sent to every member in this House: if you continue on this path, we will run campaigns in your seats like we did in those seats, and we will win. Even if it takes those few extra years, we're going to keep organising and we're going to keep fighting. Because, as I've said again and again, we don't fight for self-interest and we don't fight for corporate donors; we fight for each other. Time and again in history, the power of collective action, the power of ordinary people working together, has won. I truly believe that over the next few years it can win again. </span>

That's nearly a decade ago, and I responded by saying that the conditions we'd seen were exactly what scientists had been warning of for several decades. Climate change didn't start the fire, but it sure fed the flames and turned it into a disaster for the entire community. More frequent and intense droughts, storms, and heatwaves—more dangerous weather events—have wreaked havoc on people's livelihoods and communities. These are all the things that had been predicted. Now, in my community, we are living them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Macquarie, with the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, is among the most disaster-prone places in Australia. The most recent flood, the fourth natural disaster in a little over two years, has left people feeling exhausted and hopeless about their ability to recover. Don't even ask about the cost or availability of insurance. My community is already paying the price in many ways. We're living the consequences of the serious failure of governments to take long-term action to limit climate change. It's been heartbreaking to sit on the other side of this chamber for six years and see the failure of the previous government who, for nine years and with such bloody-mindedness, refused to act on this issue. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am very proud to be standing here in only our second week of parliament debating one of the most important pieces of legislation that this parliament will deal with. We are taking swift action to legislate on the commitment that we made to the Australian people—and the commitment that I made to the people of Macquarie. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four key elements in this climate change legislation. The first is that we're enshrining in law the 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030 and setting the net zero target for 2050. We are one of the highest greenhouse gas emitters in the world per capita. It is a great achievement for us to say, 'This is our target.' It is wonderful to have the minister here in the chamber, who has done so much work in being pragmatic but ambitious with this target. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 43 per cent target isn't the result of us sitting down and saying, 'Hey, let's pick a number; let's just randomly pick a number that people might like the sound of.' This is the result of saying: 'What are the things we know we could do? What are the things the previous government could have done but didn't, and where would that get us?' The modelling shows that we can get to 43 per cent. But, of course, it isn't a ceiling on our ambition; it's a floor. I look forward to us achieving that 43 per cent and then saying, 'What next?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think people are surprised when we say we're going to have 82 per cent of our power generated by renewables by 2030. That is a big number. Increasing the uptake of electric vehicles by making them cheaper for people is the purpose of another piece of legislation that's before this parliament. These are the practical things that we are doing. Quite frankly, they could have been done in previous years. We are very proud on this side that we're the ones who did this and that Labor has come with this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second element in this legislation is about the Climate Change Authority and once again allowing them to be the independent expert adviser on Australia's progress against our targets and having open and transparent publishing about it. What a revelation that's going to be!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third step is that our Minister for Climate Change and Energy will report annually to the parliament on the progress and how we're going meeting the targets—again, a measure of accountability, something we are not afraid of on this side of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, the bill inserts the emission reduction targets in the objectives and functions of the organisations that are government agencies so that people like Infrastructure Australia have to think about our targets. As for ARENA, the bill will make sure ARENA does what it was created to do, and that is to foster renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been heartening in many speeches during the debate today to hear the goodwill of much of the crossbench and what they're bringing to the chamber on this legislation. I think it's great to see the support for our Labor bill. This legislation can end the climate wars. It is ending the climate wars at one level, and it can continue to do that provided there is goodwill from the crossbench.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is really key about this, though, is that it brings so many opportunities. We can continue to rebuild our relationship with our Pacific neighbours, for whom climate change is the biggest threat to their homes. We can hold our heads high again internationally rather than being a climate pariah. We have jobs opportunities. We have investment coming in, and we're looking at five out of six of those hundreds of thousands of jobs in renewables being created in the regions. These are the exciting things that transform our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a local level, I'm delighted that we're going to have community batteries in both the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. These are the things that change the country. They change the world for future generations. They give them hope, and I've got to tell you: the electorate of Macquarie needs to have a sense of hope as we get smashed by disaster after disaster. The climate bills are among the very first things that we have brought to this parliament and debated in this parliament. We take climate change seriously, and this shows we're prepared to act. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:58</span>):  Today is my son's birthday. He is 31. I'm standing tonight to speak on Labor's Climate Change Bill 2022. When my youngest son was 15, I had enormous hope that we were going to do something about climate change. My three sons had enormous hope that, as a country, we were locked into a future that would see us take the lead internationally. It's been a long road—an enormously long road—and we're here tonight because it's the right thing to do. It's the responsible thing to do. We're back with the good global citizens who take responsibility. We become part of the solution. It has been a long journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those in the chamber who still try and guess my age, I am old enough to remember being an assistant principal in a local school in my electorate of Lalor when local activist Harry van Moorst approached me. I organised a screening of <span style="font-style:italic;">An </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Inconvenient Truth</span>, Al Gore's moving, action-making, provocative documentary, and students in my school and their parents attended to watch it. It was the same year I first heard the term 'triple bottom line'. I heard it from corporations that were presenting locally about the bright future that we were going to have because corporate Australia was on board with action on climate change. Big business was with us. I am old enough to remember the 2009 Senate vote that torpedoed the CPRS. I am old enough to remember what ultimately gave the laggards and the deniers opposite the power to derail the disruption that we desperately needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something to the generations of students I taught to create a cogent argument. I taught them to stand up for what they held dear. I taught them to influence an outcome. To the local people and young people of Lalor I have taught, who have expressed their frustration and often their despair at the decade of inaction that was thrust upon us, I want to say again: hope, hard work, creativity and the power of expression bring change. Tonight we say it has brought change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the minister, who is in the chamber with me now, the member for McMahon, Chris Bowen, who has crafted a new way forward with my Labor colleagues. He's taken those things—hope, hard work, creativity—and he's creating change. We are creating change with him, and everyone in the chamber is doing the same. Today is a day of extraordinary celebration, a day we finally moved from inertia to action. We are going to set a target; we are going to set two. We are going to set a 43 per cent target for 2030 and a zero per cent target for 2050. Those students I taught across the years about how to get ongoing improvement will understand, and they will tune in now when I start talking about setting targets. We are going to set a target, we are going to measure what matters and we are going to be accountable for the progress against those targets. We are going to measure that progress and, more importantly, as all students I've ever taught know, beyond that target to the next level. What's next, I asked those students all the time about their progress in my classroom. It's an incredibly proud day. It's a day when we all acknowledge that to go after what is possible is much more important than to go after what is perfect, because, if you get stuck on what's perfect, you obstruct what is possible. These have been hard lessons. I hope that everybody across the country understands those lessons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we move forward with certainty. The businesses that talked to me about the triple bottom line so many years ago will have certainty beyond this legislation being passed; they'll have certainty that they can deliver, that they can actually act in their best interests. We are going to be moving forward together as a country after tonight. The laggards will be behind us, and the rest of us will keep moving forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent a community that has some of the highest rates of rooftop solar in the country. They are really proud tonight. I am really proud to say that we have joined with the state government, which has already made commitments to community batteries, and we will be one of the first electorates to have a new community battery delivered by the federal government. Our commitment is to the grassroots because it is the grassroots of this country that have driven this change. They were blocked for 10 years. But it's activists, community members and people who care about the future of their children. When I think about those generations of kids, when I think about my classroom, when I think of that viewing of <span style="font-style:italic;">An </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Inconvenient</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Truth</span> and when I think about where those young people are now—changing the world in all their many and varied ways—I know that they're with me tonight thinking, 'We're there.' It's been slow. There have been blockers. But we're finally there. We're finally ready to confront the challenge and embrace the renewal opportunity that's before our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to take our place internationally. We're going to be leaders. And, as you've heard from so many speakers tonight, the planning of this bill and what is put into this program and this policy includes consideration for the change and how change might impact our regions particularly. Those things have been built in. This is a fabulous piece of work. I am really proud to be a member of the Labor Party tonight. I'm really proud to be a member of a Labor government that's actually going to finally deliver on the promise to the moral dilemma of our age.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:06</span>):  In the lead-up to the 2019 election, workers in the electorate of Canning were worried because they knew their jobs were on the line because of increased costs in energy-intensive industries. They were worried about what Labor would do to their electricity bills and their livelihoods if they were elected. Their fears were realised as the election campaign unfolded, which is why Australians turned their backs on Labor in 2019. When a crowd of our coal workers came to my electorate office in 2018, I stood on the back of a flatbed truck and I told them this: 'We've rushed through renewables. We've made power expensive, not just for industry but for working families and seniors, and you guys have paid the price, with people trying to negotiate down your pay and conditions.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These men and women were fighting for their livelihoods, and their employers were struggling to keep the lights on. I told those workers we should be putting Australian workers and Australians families and seniors first. They shouldn't come second, but that's what Labor's doing today by rushing through this legislation. We know that ordinary Australians will bear the brunt of these measures. Instead of using cheap and reliable base-load power from coal and gas, households will be under pressure as energy costs explode on the back of imported renewables. Australian jobs will once again be on the line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally this country cannot have a conversation about a climate change bill without confronting the obvious effect it will have on jobs and the cost of living. But Labor is so focused on the politics that they have not considered the consequences. Through the Climate Change Bill and the associated amendment bill, they have removed all ministerial accountability for the impact of their policies on jobs, wages, investment and regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election the Prime Minister said he wouldn't be forced into deals with fringe groups. But this government, with the support of the Greens, has once again realised fears and become more extreme. This was confirmed today by the Greens leader, the member for Melbourne. The member for Melbourne confirmed that the Albanese government included restrictions on the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility, Export Finance Australia and Infrastructure Australia in its climate change legislation solely to secure the support of the Greens. These restrictions will make it harder, if not impossible, for these agencies to recommend or provide finance and insurance for projects in the energy, resources and agricultural sectors. It will see important regional infrastructure projects—projects that support more than 3,000 workers and their families in Canning—overlooked because of their connection to vital production industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Labor adopting a Greens policy from 2019. The Prime Minister has made many promises about his commitment to coal and gas projects, but, by denying them finance, he is stopping them in their tracks. This is a ban by stealth, but it's now time to blow its cover. It will affect workers and families across Australia. We cannot trust this government when they promise that not one Australian job will be lost as a result of their climate change policies. And we cannot trust them when, just two months in—</span>

The mining industry has been at the forefront of climate change action, and the truth is that we know that climate change action is good for people, it's good for the community and it's good for jobs. I am really proud of what the mining industry is doing and the leadership that we've seen in the west. I can't wait to see what happens with this policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community of Swan is asking for action on climate change. My team and I knocked on a lot of doors—45,000 doors out of a total of about 70,000 doors. The issues varied, but at their heart was a concern about the future. There is one particular day I remember, when I was knocking on some doors in Shepperton Road in Victoria Park, which is just down the road from where I live. I remember conversation after conversation where people, in their own words, explained how they wanted a more sustainable future and they wanted action on climate change. On the third door in a row I squealed with delight and shed a tear of happiness. It was the same message over and over again. I knew indeed that this was the climate change election. I asked that neighbour: 'Did you know that all of your neighbours want exactly the same thing that you want?' The thing, though, is that the Liberals—the opposition today—didn't get the memo that the people of Australia want action on climate change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the past 12 years I've been working with some of Australia's largest companies to help reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The work of corporate Australia has become more sophisticated with time. Twelve years ago, when I started working in this space, I was helping companies with counting their greenhouse gas emissions. This, of course, was because of great policy that Prime Minister John Howard introduced, the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act. He knew that in the future we would need to manage our greenhouse gas emissions and that we needed action on climate change. He introduced this act because he knew that we needed a framework to work out how we were going to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Thank you for the work that you did there, John. Following on from that, we've seen that companies want to decarbonise, they want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and they've become more sophisticated. But the truth is that we need all aspects of the economy to do their fair amount of work, and that's what this Climate Change Bill does.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I always knew that climate change was important, but for me it became personal when I got a phone call from my sister-in-law, who was in the Adelaide Hills. She gave me a call and said, 'Look, Zaneta, we're evacuating. It's bushfire season. We've got the stay-or-go call. I've got asthma. I am taking baby Willo. We're leaving.' My father-in-law, who's a Uniting Church minister, stayed in the community because he wanted to provide pastoral care to that community. I remember hanging up the phone call, and when I relayed the conversation to my husband I said to him, in tears, 'Your family are evacuating their town.' In those particular fires, people lost property and cattle. Luckily, no lives were lost, but that's not always what happens. The truth is that the thing that we know about climate change is that the intensity will increase and so will the frequency.</span>

They send a signal. To paraphrase my colleague the member for Wentworth, the coalition had 23 per cent women in the lower house in 1996, and after the last election it became 19 per cent. The Labor Party brought about affirmative-action targets in our rules in 1994. At the time, women represented 14 per cent of the federal caucus. The first target was set at 35 per cent, and it was raised to 40 per cent by 2002. At the 2015 ALP National Conference, it was lifted to 45 per cent by 2020 and 50 per cent by 2025. Today 49 per cent of my colleagues, both here and in the other place, are women. SMART targets are leadership. They send a signal to others.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:16</span>):  The Climate Change Bill 2022 is a very important bill. As the honourable member has just outlined, a lot of the Australian public have the wish that more be done. But all through the last parliament and the parliament before that and the parliament before that—all the time I've been here—we have been committed to addressing the imperative of reducing our carbon emissions. In fact, anyone would think we hadn't done anything, judging by the relentless barrage of saying we're not doing enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put things in perspective, less than three per cent of the world's energy is delivered by renewable energy across the whole globe. But at times in Australia we have reached 26 per cent, long before the Albanese government came into the government benches. We have achieved more on the climate targets and delivered more reductions than Canada, New Zealand and most of the EU, who set totally unrealistic targets. We have a track record. We've met the targets that were set at Kyoto, and we should not be feeling embarrassed or ashamed, because we've actually done a lot, and we seem to get no credit for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, to give them credit, they said they would have a target of 43 per cent, so they're legislating it. They've already written off to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and that is our target. So this legislation is a bit of symbolism, but I find it's pretty sinister in that, yet again, this legislation means that this room and our elected representatives will have no control over investments in things that keep our nation running. It'll be decided by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, by ARENA and by CSIRO. You've only got to see what the Leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, announced today in the National Press Club: that Export Finance Australia—which has funded coal and gas projects, which, incidentally, delivered the energy that has built this country and which we still depend on for 65 to 70 per cent of our energy—will not be able to fund any of the things our nation is crying out for. We have a dependency on liquid fuel from overseas. We have, as you've seen only recently, electricity shortages. There's not enough generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This sort of legislation will lead to the things that have happened in the UK. Activists and other antidevelopment entities will use these legislated targets to mount legal arguments, like stopping high-speed rail—as they did in the UK because of similar legislation—and stopping the government from continuing highway maintenance and building new roads, because cement is a bad thing. In the UK, this is real. This is not theoretically what could happen. This will happen if you put legislation in that gives standing to obscure climate based arguments and restrictive trends. We have the LNG plant in Darwin that needs to go ahead. We're keeping the rest of Asia and lots of our customers supplied with energy. We also want to have energy in our country, but the changes in this legislation will have rather big consequences.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I did hear the good member's comments about why she thought climate change and climate action was such an emergency. It was because her family members were caught in those horrible fires in the Adelaide Hills. But I do remember, as a young doctor, Ash Wednesday.

I do not support this bill. But please do not assume, because I am standing here today to speak against this bill, that I do not agree with taking serious action on climate change and reducing Australia's contribution to global emissions. I do.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We failed to form government in May 2022. My greatest disappointment is that we have consistently failed to demonstrate to Australians that we have taken real action on climate change. The coalition government's record over the past nine years demonstrates clearly that we, on this side of the House, were not only effective in reducing emissions; we were capable of doing it in a safe and responsible manner—that is, without raising electricity prices and taxes, without shutting down coal and gas production or exports, without job losses, without impacting household businesses or the broader economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's emissions reduction story has been one of consistent achievement. We met and exceeded our Kyoto targets for 2020. Our emissions are more than 20 per cent below levels measured in 2005. Before the election, Australia was on track to reduce emissions by up to 35 per cent by 2030—well above our target of 26 per cent to 28 per cent. Before the election, we announced our commitment to net zero by 2050. Under the coalition, Australia's emissions outpaced the record of the United States, New Zealand, Japan and every other major commodity-exporting nation. We should be proud of our record. We set the global standard on the world stage for all to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a great honour to have contributed to our success, serving as the former Commonwealth environment minister. In 2018, I proudly represented our nation at Katowice, in Poland, at the climate change conference called COP24. Far from being ridiculed or criticised for the Morrison government's climate inaction, Australia was praised for the actions it was taking to reduce emissions, like the Emissions Reduction Fund and our investments from CEFC and ARENA, and also the world-leading, accurate and transparent way in which our nation captures emissions data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I was chairing the COP24 subcommittee, which included representatives from the US, Canada and New Zealand, it was clear to me that Australia had a very positive reputation for its professionalism and its action on climate. In fact, I had many side meetings at that COP24 meeting with a variety of countries who were very keen to understand the actions we were taking, because there were very few countries who were actually taking action. There was a lot of desire, but we were taking action, and that was recognised. That was back in 2018. This was at a time when many nations simply had emissions targets but no plan to achieve them. For many countries today, that is still the case. Australia, at that 2018 event, was hailed for its actions. But you would not have read about any of this success in the media back at home, because clearly this did not support that cement hardened narrative that a Liberal-led government was taking no action on climate. Sadly, nothing has changed since then. I really look forward to the media holding the Albanese government to account on their 43 per cent emissions target with the same dogged determination that they've been able to apply to the ex-coalition government since 2013.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor say they want an end to the climate wars. Well, Labor's behaviour has been a PR war. We may have lost that last battle, but Labor's base has been lost now to the Greens. Once this legislation inevitably passes, we will need to urgently turn our attention to how we meet the 43 per cent target. Ambition is simply not enough, and we know that wind and sun will not be enough either. While we all agree that renewables play a vital role in Australia's domestic energy supply, they need to be balanced responsibly by other solutions. If we're serious—and we should be serious about lowering emissions—uranium must be part of the conversation. In Western Australia, there is now a ban on new uranium mines. I proudly approved the last uranium mine when I was the environment minister. I call on state Labor and federal Labor. We need to start having the conversation in a very respectful way and make sure our Indigenous Australians know what's at stake. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  Last March, I stood in this place, and I said that I felt we were facing a tsunami with respect to housing insecurity and housing affordability. A year ago, during Homelessness Week 2021, I called on all governments—state, federal and local—to work together to ensure we have the resources for affordable housing to help address homelessness through increasing the rental allowance, a national housing strategy and more federal support for social housing. I therefore welcome the government's commitment to develop a new national housing and homelessness plan to the tune of $10 billion, known as the Housing Australia Future Fund, for social and affordable housing. I really want to know what this will mean for our regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, I met with Homelessness Australia, the Community Housing Industry Association and National Shelter to discuss their theme for Homelessness Week 2022, which is 'To end homelessness we need a plan'. Together, we reflected on this theme and the need for any plan to tackle homelessness to recognise the special challenges that the provision of social and affordable housing means for non-metropolitan areas. Mayo, like many electorates, is suffering from a lack of affordable housing. This is leaving many of my constituents couch surfing and rough sleeping, and, sadly, I have even seen tents behind one of our local churches. This lack of affordable housing is preventing areas like the Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island from attracting new workers because there's simply nowhere for people to live if they get a job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, I discussed with Homelessness Australia, CHIA and National Shelter how we need to work together on all levels. This is a problem that affects all three levels of government, and a solution can only be found if we all work together. I believe that we need to do more to incentivise investor involvement, and the Future Fund could be further boosted if we somehow come up with a plan that can also allow mum-and-dad investors to be part of this solution. Smart measures can be implemented to mitigate the loss of affordable housing due to the ageing out of the NRAS system. Perhaps we could even stretch those last NRAS properties. I know many in my community have come off the NRAS system, the rents have gone up and people can no longer afford to stay in there. We need to keep every possible housing stock we can. I'm glad that there is now a commitment by the federal government to invest in social and affordable housing. I think we can all work through this together, because everybody deserves a place to call home.</span>

My first and most important duty is as the member for Isaacs. As we learned at the last election from some high-profile examples in my home state of Victoria, the privilege of being re-elected by your constituents can never, ever be taken for granted. Every election is hard work, and every victory is hard won. My job was made easier by those who dedicated so much time and effort during the campaign to keeping Isaacs in Labor hands. To the hardworking and tireless volunteers who stood with me at prepoll for many hours, knocked on doors and made countless phone calls: thank you. You are the lifeblood of our party, and you are also great company. To my electorate staff, who not only support me during campaigns but do vital work every day to help constituents: thank you. I could not do this without you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those many hours at prepoll were full of interesting and engaging conversations with voters. Many were ready for change and tired of the old excuses of the former Morrison government. Many were cynical that things would never change. To those people, I want to say this: whether or not you voted for me, the new Albanese Labor government will deliver change for the better. We are a government which will listen. We are a government which will deliver on our promises. When things go wrong, we will not make excuses; we will be honest and frank, as the Australian people deserve. We will fight every day for you. We promised a better future, and I truly believe better days lie ahead. To the people of Isaacs, thank you for voting for me once more and for putting your trust in me. It's an honour to once more represent you in this place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Raff Ciccone and I travelled to Hawaii and participated in and observed the Rim of the Pacific exercises, or RIMPAC, which included 26 nations around the world. The concept was the interoperability between all of those nations—to show that force, together, for our own sovereignty and for the sovereignty of our allies. But it wasn't just observing; it was actually doing. It was, I have to say, an experience emptying out the garbage bags in the hold of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span>, on which we spent three nights, in addition to participating in exercises for emergency management—all the way up to attending high-level briefings with the captain of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> for three days.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then spent two days with the amphibious unit 2RAR on the coastline of Hawaii, watching these extraordinary human beings carry out incredible feats—jumping out of helicopters, inflating life rafts out at sea, putting on double-engine outboards and operating back in to sea. I had the pleasure of meeting Navy diver William Sharkey, whose parents both live in Bellingen, in my electorate. I'd like to thank him and his colleagues for their hospitality and for showing me around their unit, as well as Navy Lieutenant Kris Petersen, who is part of the disaster response on board HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span>. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  This is my first opportunity to put on the record here in this place my sincere thanks and gratitude to the wonderful people of the electorate of Franklin for sending me back here to this place and for their vote of confidence in me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been an extraordinary year. Currently, in Hobart, we're going through another wave of COVID, and locals have raised that with me as a serious concern. But throughout the campaign they also raised a whole range of ideas and concerns with me, particularly around rising costs of living, access to health care and affordable housing. So I'm really thrilled to be part of the new Albanese Labor government and to be the Minister for Housing, the Minister for Homelessness and the Minister for Small Business. As the people of Franklin would know, I'm hardworking and committed, and I am absolutely committed to delivering on federal Labor's election commitments when it comes to housing, homelessness and small business—particularly around housing affordability, which is a really serious issue in my home town of Hobart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hobart has some of the lowest vacancy rates and some of the highest rental increases. We have also had some of the highest property increases. It is becoming truly unaffordable, for most people, to get into the housing market, to put a roof over their head and to find a safe place to call home. Indeed, over the last 12 months—including prior to having this portfolio—I've had an extraordinary number of people at risk of homelessness coming into my electorate office and trying to get accommodation and somewhere for them and their children to stay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really thrilled to be part of a government that also made some very significant commitments to my electorate. A $60 million upgrade to Hobart Airport will change the Hobart economy. It will allow exporters out of Hobart to have wide-body aircraft on the Hobart runway. It is the only runway in Tasmania capable of doing this, and it will allow our fresh produce, which our producers in Tasmania are so good at, to get to the rest of the world faster. Whether we're talking about crayfish, abalone or salmon, there is some amazing produce coming out of my home state—cherries, berries and all sorts of wonderful things that we want to get to overseas markets much faster. This upgrade will create a significant number of jobs in my home state of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also made a commitment to Clarence headspace in my electorate—more mental health services—which I'm absolutely committed to. Another thing we did was commit $20 million to increasing ferry services for public transport on the Derwent River, which will help with some of the congestion and traffic issues in Hobart. A ferry trial has been run by the state government and has been incredibly successful. So I'm really pleased that we've made this commitment around infrastructure to allow more ferries across the Derwent, and I look forward to delivering for the people of Franklin.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I'm going to take this opportunity to add to my comments from last night on the cashless debit card and its rollout. I said at the time that I thought it was pretty sad that the first urgent bill the government had to get through the parliament was on the cashless debit card. It's a bill which will of course give more money to chronic gamblers, chronic alcoholics and chronic drug addicts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said that I had more to say. I do thank Minister Rishworth for coming to Ceduna, but I was disappointed at the fact that on her first visit to Ceduna she came on a mission, which was to shut down the card, not to find out whether the card worked. She did meet with the Far West Coast Indigenous leaders community council, and with the local council, and I sat in on that meeting. I also told her, when I had an opportunity to speak, that she and the government will be held responsible for whatever the outcome is and that they should be prepared for that, on the back of the fact that the state coroner found that seven individuals died in Ceduna owing to alcohol abuse, which led to a raft of changes in the town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you, the Ceduna community is a vastly changed place compared with what it was seven or eight years ago, when we had bars up on windows, high levels of graffiti and attacks on property throughout the community. It's a much more peaceful and civilised place at this time, and I largely put that down to the card. When I speak of the government responsibility here, I will say that I asked the former mayor, Allan Suter, who was a champion of this card—in fact, we worked together to bring firstly the BasicsCard and then the cashless debit card to Ceduna—whether there was something he'd like to say. He said that the PM and responsible ministers will be held responsible, especially for what happens to women and children in community. I was speaking recently to a friend from Ceduna who had been in Katherine and Tennant Creek and they were horrified by what they saw there. They said, 'There but for the cashless debit card go we.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question is: if things go pear-shaped in Ceduna—and I hope they don't, because I don't want my community all smashed up—what will the minister do? What will the government do to address those problems? Are the federal government going to fund extra police? Are they going to fund night patrols? Are they going to fund community constables? What is it that they are going to do? Given the track record of all those things in actually getting rid of these types of antisocial behaviour, I wish them luck. We are soon going to find out in real time just what a good job the cashless debit card was doing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Well done, and I'm sure you'll perform brilliantly—as you've already started to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've served in the House for almost a decade, and whenever I've made a contribution on the National Disability Insurance Scheme it has been to highlight the woeful administration and vicious, cruel and callous cuts made by the previous Liberal government. In the last few months of the Morrison government, 220 participants were having their funding slashed by 20 per cent or more each and every day. This is a shocking indictment of those opposite and how we as a nation look after some of the most vulnerable people in our community. So it's good to recognise that the Albanese government has reacted swiftly to address these shocking cuts and appalling review processes participants have to contend with. I commend the Minister for the NDIS for establishing the alternative dispute resolution scheme, which will hopefully spare participants and their families and carers the inconvenience and, in many cases, the trauma of having to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw the attention of the House to the experience of a particularly vulnerable constituent of mine who is suffering because of the cuts to her plan. Vicki from Speers Point was born blind and has congenital rubella syndrome. Over the past few years her hearing has deteriorated to a point where she can no longer hear without hearing aids, and even with hearing aids she has difficulty. All medical evidence provided to the agency indicates that Vicki requires more support. However, in their wisdom, they have actually cut Vicki's funding. This is a highly at-risk participant who is blind and deaf and who requires significant assistance, and the NDIS have cut the much-needed support she has at a time when she actually requires more assistance. Vicki and her carer are now enduring the internal review process. I can tell the House that I have never come across an internal review at the NDIS that has changed the original decision. If the decision is upheld, they will have to go to the AAT. This is wrong. That is why the new mechanism being introduced by the government is so sorely needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's often said that a mark of a civilised society is how they treat their most vulnerable. Well, on this test, the way the NDIS has been cutting participants' plans, we are failing. People with disability and their families and carers deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. They should not have to justify over and over again to bureaucrats why support is necessary. The NDIS is one of the Labor legacies, along with Medicare, compulsory superannuation and needs based school funding, that I'm so proud of. The coalition trashed the system during their decade in office, and that's why I'm so proud that the Albanese government is enacting much-needed change to ensure people with disability get the care they deserve. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to the brilliant members of the Bathurst community whose names have been etched into the city's scrolls. These citizens have been recognised by Bathurst Regional Council as Living Legends, humble heroes who tirelessly serve and support their community. They don't wear capes, but they are true community champions, determined to build a better city, create a brighter future or simply bring about a lasting smile on the faces of those in our local community. From Dunkeld to Keppel Street to Kelso and everywhere in between, they demonstrate that what counts in life is what we do for others, and they strive mightily to make Bathurst and its surrounding region the best place it can be. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the weekend I was thrilled to attend a special presentation honouring the city's Living Legends from the past three years, like Arthur Davis, who received legendary status in 2020. Mr Davis's love of rally car racing saw him compete in the 1977 London to Sydney marathon, the longest car rally in history. Covering three continents and 30,000 kilometres, he would call into 2BS to update Bathurst on how he was tracking. He eventually combined his love of getting behind the wheel with charity, running the Kidney Kar Rally for 17 years with his wife, Kim, to raise vital funds for kids and young people with kidney disease. Other amazing Living Legends from 2020 were George Gaal, David Pennells, Geoffrey Porter, Jane Rawlings and Lachlan Rendall. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021, Amanda Wilding became a Bathurst Living Legend. Ms Wilding has been volunteering at Daffodil Cottage wig library since it opened more than eight years ago, stocking more than 250 wigs. Amanda assists people undergoing treatment for cancer or who are suffering hair loss to feel like themselves again through finding the perfect new do. Other recipients in 2021 were Soula Aspros, Margaret Bower, Doug Coates, Royce George and Anne Llewellyn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> This year six Bathurst citizens were recognised: Lyn Cooper, Maureen Markwick, Gloria Packham, Terry Roberts, Paul Smith and Sister Mary Comer, who in 1988 founded Centacare Bathurst, where families could seek counselling in country New South Wales. To this day, the centre provides social welfare services to children and families across the western region. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to the Bathurst Living Legends. Your perseverance, courage and kindness leave a legacy we can all look up to. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">RTS</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  Deputy Speaker Claydon, I congratulate you on your role. Today I rise for my constituency statement not only to congratulate an outstanding member of my community but to shine a light on his achievements and his accomplishments. Members of this place may recall the name of Jai Hindley, who won the Giro d'Italia in 2022, just a few months ago. Jai has had a passion for cycling since he was a little boy and has competed in cycling competitions his whole life. Jai has been travelling overseas for cycling competitions since he was 15. This perseverance and dedication led him to become an Aussie legend and the first Australian to win the Giro d'Italia. We are so incredibly proud of him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pearce is fortunate enough to be home to Jai and his family, I would like to take this time to provide the chamber and the Australian people with some further information about Jai and what makes him so great. Jai can be described as caring, thoughtful, confident and easygoing. Family is important to him. He has a determined dedication to learning and striving for the next level in his development. However, Jai never forgets the beauty of our electorate and looks forward to coming home to all things Australian and spending time by the ocean in Mindarie. Jai not only grew up in Pearce but was born in Pearce. Before moving overseas to live at the age of 18, Jai attended the Mindarie Primary School and the Peter Moyes Anglican Community School, of which I was foundation registrar. I met Jai's family during this time. Jai later went on to study at the Mindarie Senior College, of which I'm a board member. I'm sure all of these local schools are proud to list him among their alumni.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that great achievements come with great sacrifice and a lot of hard work. Jai juggled school and also trained four times a week at the Midland velodrome, in summer and in winter. He would train on the road in the Perth Hills during the early mornings, before the heat of the day. Jai would train on a bike six days a week, with a 5 am start each day before school. He would ride to training, he would train and then he would ride home. For a young person to have such dedication and perseverance is nothing short of outstanding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to share a mantra of Jai's in the hope that it influences other aspiring sports champions. Jai's mantra is, 'Ride hard, train harder; go hard or go home.' All of the hard work Jai has put in has paid off. He competed in the Midland Cycling Club events on track and on road from the age of six. He competed interstate from under-18 age groups. He's won the national championships. He competed in the world championships in the under-19s age group and then spent a season racing in Italy, where he turned 18, with an Italian team. That's where Jai learned a lot about European terrain and racing. The next few years saw Jai selected in the Australian World Tour Academy, based in Italy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to a great member of the Casey community who passed away in May this year, David Horner. David was a life member of the Healesville Cricket Club. He was husband to Robyn and father to Tom and Nick, and he was also a friend of mine. Dave was influential in our community in Healesville, saving the Healesville Cricket Club 20 years ago when it was on its knees. He put in time, dedication and financial resources to support the club so it could continue to be a great place in the community, supporting young men and women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dave was a larger-than-life character, and that was shown at his funeral just five weeks ago, when it was standing room only and great stories were shared about a man who loved his family, loved his community and loved fishing and a beer. He was a humble man, but he was a great man as well. Dave had a huge influence on my life when I was a young man, supporting me through my challenges and providing the fatherly wisdom that a senior person at a sports club can when you listen to them and not your family. His funeral was a tribute to the man that he is and the influence he had on his community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dave was struck down with cancer 12 months ago, and it was a shock to a lot of us. But I was fortunate during the campaign to run into Dave at the Terminus Hotel, where he and the table of knowledge were discussing the world's problems. What struck me was that, despite the challenges that he had and knowing the fate that he would have, Dave didn't change. The smile was there. The humour was there. The love for his friends and family was there. I was so honoured that I could run into him on the campaign and spend some time talking to him, sharing our journey together. What will stay with me is the pride that Dave had in me and others who are representing our community and the joy that I saw he had. So I was overwhelmed that he was with us on election day so he could see the result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on the record my thanks to David Horner for the support that he provided to me as a young man to help me be here today, and the support he's provided to many young people in our community over not just his amazing journey at the Healesville Cricket Club but the time he's spent at the Seville Cricket Club. In many ways, Dave Horner represents what community spirit is all about: looking after your friends, looking after your family and looking after your community for no reason other than to help people enjoy their lives.</span>

A big shout-out to you guys for travelling three hours and leaving very early in the morning to get here. A big thankyou to Uncle Ossie Cruse for coming along as well. Uncle Ossie is well known to many people across this parliament. He's well known to most people in our area. He's a much respected elder of our community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The students and staff of Lumen Christi Catholic College acknowledge the First Nations people of the Yuin country in our local region of the Bega Valley shire. Lumen supports reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians through our support of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. In response to the Uluru statement, the school embarked on a journey to build awareness of the Uluru aims. They hope that the many voices from nations across Australia will be heard. In their college they sought to bring together a choir of voices encouraging makarrata, truth-telling and a voice to parliament. Today the college and its community present a collaborative artwork, and I table on their behalf a document called <span style="font-style:italic;">From </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">heart</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> the story of its creation </span>to parliament.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2020 project was sparked by passionate discussions between the social justice advocates of the far South Coast and the Lumen Christi social justice advocates group, which aims to raise awareness and support for the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Indigenous and non-Indigenous students and staff working together illustrated aspects of local culture. Each corner represents in local language: baringa, the light; monaroo, the people; gudu, the waters; and bobberrer, the mountains. They are also the names of the four college houses. The artwork depicts messenger ducks flying across the night sky carrying our good wishes. Indigenous students are represented in each of the reeds in the foreground. Their pastoral care classes are represented in the collective statements, messages and signatures from 700 students and 100 staff acknowledging the significant local elder Pastor Uncle Ossie Cruse, who was present at Uluru and a signatory of the original Statement from the Heart. The canvas was gifted to the Jigamy community near Eden, and they are proud to be connected in our local community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru Statement from the Heart tells us that constitutional reforms empower Indigenous people to take a rightful place in their own country. Their children will flourish and their culture will be a gift to the country. Lumen Christi Catholic College looks forward to sharing in the gift, and they support the Uluru Statement from the Heart. A big thank you to the students. I think you can see that the future is in good hands when we have students like these, who are so passionate about reform in our country.</span>

                  <a href="193430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I join Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Penny Wong, in offering my sincere condolences and the condolences of all Australians to the late Shinzo Abe's family and to the people of Japan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hard to fathom that a statesman of such stature, such conviction and such determination could be felled by one cowardly act of violence. Four days after his death, I visited the Consulate-General of Japan in Melbourne, where I signed Mr Abe's condolence book. The consul-general, Mr Junji Shimada, spoke movingly of the outpouring of grief from the people of Victoria and about the large number of people who had been visiting the consulate to pay their respects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That flood of emotion demonstrates that the relationship between Australia and Japan is not simply one based on the practicalities of commerce or on mutual national security concerns. It's a true friendship. Japan is one of Australia's closest diplomatic, trade and security partners. Mr Abe's achievements in strengthening the relationship between Japan and Australia have been well documented in this parliament: the elevation of our bilateral relationship to a special strategic partnership, the ratification of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement and the championing of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, shortly after my arrival in this place, Mr Abe gave an address in this parliament. He spoke about the painful history of World War II and the thawing of hostilities between our two countries that led to what he called 'the second coming of Japan's industry'. He spoke about the economic and social reform within this country and about our shared ideals: peace, freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law. His speech was received with great affection by members of this chamber, as Mr Abe's engagements with Australia so often were.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abe was a true leader and a statesman. He was wholly dedicated to his nation and was determined to use his influence to effect change. And so, as Prime Minister, he set to work 'like a drill bit'—he said in this parliament in 2014—'breaking through the vested interests and the norms that have deep roots'. Mr Abe's suite of economic policies, Abenomics, was bold. It had to be. And Mr Abe worked tirelessly to enact the reforms that would revitalise Japan. Indeed, at times, he was personally involved in discussions between employers and unions on wage increases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Abenomics delivered success: record-low unemployment, an economic boom and more women in the workplace than ever before. Japan will still face many challenges in the future—below-target GDP growth, demographic pressures and productivity and innovation concerns—but Mr Abe's vision and commitment saw Japan through a sluggish domestic economic environment and a volatile global context. He did not flinch, and he negotiated, compromised and fought to break through inertia and convention. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, Mr Abe opened Japan to the world. As Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, Mr Abe:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… had a vision of a Japan that exercised a degree of influence in the world commensurate with its economic weight and cultural significance …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abe was a realist. He knew that Japan's national interest was in globalisation, and he pursued this. He opened Japan up to global capital, foreign goods and international visitors, and, as Japan's view of the world changed, so did Australia's view of Japan. I saw this in my own family. My grandparents' generation might have had cause for ongoing resentment against Japan in the wake of their experiences of the horrors of the Second World War. Shinzo Abe recognised this in his address to the parliament, when he told the House:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our fathers and grandfathers lived in a time that saw Kokoda and Sandakan . How many young Australians, with bright futures to come, lost their lives? For those who made it through the war, how much trauma did they feel years and years later from these painful memories? I can find absolutely no words to say; I can only stay humble against the evils and horrors of history. May I most humbly speak for Japan and on behalf of the Japanese people here in sending my most sincere condolences towards the many souls who lost their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After these humble words Mr Abe went on to quote Prime Minister Robert Menzies, who declared upon the recommencement of relations between Australia and Japan, 'Hostility to Japan must go. It is better to hope than always to remember.' Good words. Mr Menzies of course went on to welcome Shinzo Abe's grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, to Australia as the first Japanese Prime Minister to visit the country after the war. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the efforts of this generation, by the time that I was born, I recall my two grandfathers in particular always seeking to extend the hand of friendship to the Japanese people and to the nation that Japan had become. My grandparents regularly hosted Japanese exchange students in our small country Queensland family, and I fondly remembering listening agog as a small child about what life was like in Japan's modern new megacities, while also delighting in taking our young Japanese guests out of their comfort zones and directly exposing them to rural and regional Australia's unique flora and fauna.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a child I had no conception of how far things had come for young people in Australia and Japan to be able to share these natural human cross-cultural exchanges. This kind of change only happens because of the work of individuals, across generations, who seek to build bridges of understanding and affection. Today, aided by cheap flights, great food and a welcoming culture, Aussies throng to Japan and our cultural relationship is on track to match our economic one; a relationship of affection set to last many more generations to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Japanese emperor's reign is given a name. On 1 April 2019 Emperor Naruhito's era in Japanese history was officially named the Reiwa era . Reiwa is taken from a verse in a collection of eighth-century Japanese poetry that refers to plum blossoms in spring. As Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe explained the naming of the era to the press that spring day. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Just as the plum blossoms announce the arrival of spring after the harsh cold of winter and bloom splendidly in all their glory, all Japanese will be able to make their own blossoms come into full bloom, together with their hopes for tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shinzo Abe's career was dedicated to bringing Japan into full bloom. It is incomprehensible that his life was cut short, that he was not able to see the full flourishing of the spring that he envisaged for his nation. But the seeds that he planted and the reforms that he nurtured will continue to grow. As Prime Minister Albanese said, 'This low act of cruelty cannot be allowed to overshadow a life that was lived with such high purpose.' With the death of Shinzo Abe Australia has lost a great friend, Japan has lost a great leader and the world has lost a great statesman. May he rest in peace.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, they are the words of the song written by Dick Holler and performed and first recorded by Dion. They refer to Martin, Abraham and John. We know that the good do die young. Bobby Kennedy in 1968 said, 'Some men see things as they are and say, why; I dream things that never were and say, why not.' The same could definitely be uttered about Shinzo Abe. Bobby Kennedy's brother John was assassinated in 1963; for Abraham Lincoln, we go back to 1865; and of course Martin Luther King in 1968—all great leaders. They were all men who made a pivotal change, not just in their communities, their states, their countries; they had a global influence the likes of which we may never see again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 8 July the world was stunned by the assassination of the former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a campaigning speech in Nara, two days before elections were to be held. While domestic debates about improved security for members of parliament continue in Japan, it's also very timely to think about, to consider, to reflect upon Shinzo Abe's wonderful achievements and the legacy of them, not only in terms of foreign policy but especially here in Australia—what he did, what he represented and what will continue as his legacy for many years to come in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come here as the member for Riverina in the Central West. The town of Cowra, this Friday, will commemorate 78 years since the famous—some might say infamous—breakout at the internment camp. Cowra lost its innocence on 5 August 1944 and was thrust into a war zone which, until that very moment, was confined to anywhere but Cowra. The prisoner of war camp custodians—members of the Australian militia's 22nd Garrison Battalion—were mostly older veterans and men who were deemed unfit for the front line. They faced a dire situation. They had Japanese internees holed up in this camp who—1,100 of them, prisoners of war—in three groups stormed the boundaries of their confines and broke out. In the ensuing calamity, 231 Japanese soldiers and four Australians were killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might think that Cowra would be hostile for evermore about Japan relations. No, not at all. What they have done is that they have gone out of their way to forge ties between Cowra and Japan and between Cowra and Tokyo. The Japanese gardens—which are one of the finest gardens in the state, if not the country—are visited by many, many people. For those who haven't been there, I suggest you put it on your list of things to do. The relationship between Cowra and Japan, and the international peace and understanding that has followed that, has not been lost on citizens both here and in Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku and Kyushu.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that, when the late Japanese leader addressed the parliament on 8 July 2014, that was especially celebrated, commemorated and thought about in Cowra, because I know the close relationships they have with Japan. That speech that Shinzo Abe gave was so emblematic and reflective of the relationship that Cowra has with Japan—that Australians generally have with Japan. I go back to John 'Black Jack' McEwen and how he forged trade ties with Japan at a time when being friends with Japan was not popular at all because of what happened in World War II. But as Prime Minister Abe said himself:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our fathers and grandfathers lived in a time that saw Kokoda and Sandakan. How many young Australians, with bright futures to come, lost their lives? For those who made it through the war, how much trauma did they feel years and years later from these painful memories? I can find absolutely no words to say; I can only stay humble against the evils and horrors of history. May I most humbly speak for Japan and on behalf of the Japanese people here in sending my most sincere condolences towards the many souls who lost their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, he was wonderfully thought of here in Australia, as he should be. His loss is mourned by peace-loving people right across this nation. He was a great man. He stood for great things, just like the Kennedys, just like Martin Luther King, just like Abraham Lincoln—good men gone too young, wonderful leaders shot down, one could say, in their prime. Whilst I appreciate that Shinzo Abe had had his terms at the top and had served his nation well, he still had much more to; he still had so much more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He spoke of Australia and Japan's relationship of trust in that 2014 speech to our parliament. He spoke of standing up through the trials of history and the cooperation in the area of security and also trade. We've lost a great friend. We've lost a great partner. Certainly in my electorate I know Cowra felt his loss, as did good, peace-loving people right across this nation. I pass on my condolences to his family, to Japan, and certainly to those in Australia—all of us who mourn his passing. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I would also like to join my parliamentary colleagues in mourning the tragic death of Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest serving Prime Minister and, of course, a long-time friend of Australia. For over a decade, Shinzo Abe was really a giant of international relations, not just in our region but, I think it would be accurate to say, across the globe. He can be really credited with evolving Japan's approach to foreign affairs and security policy, which was, of course, hardly an easy task.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After decades in the post-World War II period of what we could probably characterise as a reluctance to have a more forthright or forward-leading engagement in both the region and global affairs, Japan really re-emerged under Abe as a leader in regional and global affairs. And he made this goal clear. He was open about it. He spoke about how fundamental freedom, democracy, basic human rights and the rule of law were in developing his diplomatic relationships and bilateral relationships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So much has been said—and will continue to be said and written—about Abe's legacy since his death. But I do, as we all do, want to particularly pay tribute to his immense contribution to the Indo-Pacific—even that phrase itself is something that has evolved and come from all of his tremendous work. He was the one who popularised the conception of our region as the Indo-Pacific and highlighted how important the region is to international affairs. Australia is no longer suffering, in some respects, the tyranny of distance as we had been earlier last century, on the other side of the world. Now we are front and centre in probably the most important region in global affairs. And Abe recognised that very, very clearly and very early.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He spoke in his tenure as Prime Minister about a confluence of the two seas—between the Pacific and Indian oceans—and the strategic importance of framing our region in this way, seeing it in that way, understanding it in that way. He not only recognised but embraced India as an important partner in our region—something that we, I think, learnt from, frankly, given what I have described in the past as a somewhat benign neglect of India. A lot of talk about cricket, curry and the Commonwealth, which is great, but the relationship is so much more than that, and it can be so much more than that. Abe, to his great credit, understood the importance of India as a rising power in the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He welcomed a common objective of a free, open and secure Indo-Pacific. He advanced that goal, leading through the creation of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which continues today and is an increasingly important partnership between Australia, Japan, India and the United States, another great Pacific power. He can be given credit for not only the Quad's creation but its continued significance to our region, in many respects, to get the balance right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He identified the need for a drastic reshaping, as he called it, in the areas of diplomacy and security. And he made a considered effort to build and develop bilateral and multilateral relationships that advance the security of the Indo-Pacific, as he conceived it. This included partnerships and work with ASEAN as part of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. He also helped save, to a certain extent, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement which former US President Trump had abandoned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia often looks, in many respects, to our major partners, our major friends and allies, as part of our foreign affairs for leadership, support and coordination. I think it is probably true to say we need to be looking at Abe's legacy. Australia can really understand that he was such a good friend of ours. The values that we share, that Australia and Japan share—democracy, human rights, the shared interests that we have in bolstering and propping up the international rules based order—are something we can look to. We can look to that example of the work that Abe had done. He was actually the first Japanese leader to be invited to address this parliament, in 2007, and it was his vision that helped elevate our bilateral relationship to a special strategic partnership in 2014. Under his leadership, Japan emerged as one of our like-minded partners in Asia—a legacy that endures today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a bit of a tangent, I remember when I was in this place working as the national security adviser for former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. There was a moment when we were looking at enhancing our defence relationship with Japan, and that involved Japanese forces doing exercises in Australia, on Australian territory. I was very alive to the sensitivities of a lot of our veterans, including a lot of the RSL, and all the other stakeholders. I remember calling up a lot of veterans and the RSL and talking them through the fact that we would be doing joint exercises with Japan in Queensland, for example. I called Tom Uren, the former Deputy Leader of the Labor Party. We know Tom was a POW in Burma, on the Burma Railway, and suffered horrifically during World War II. I said to Tom, 'Look, I get how this might be difficult for you as a veteran.' I think he was 90-something when I spoke to him. I'll never forget what he said to me. He said: 'Peter, first of all, I appreciate you calling to talk me through this. I will never forget what I went through in World War II and what suffering my comrades and I went through on the Burma Railway. It was horrific. Never forget—never forgive, to a certain extent, but never forget. But you've got to do what's in Australia's best national interests.' He was a big enough man, and such a great figure himself, that he was all about overcoming his own emotional hurt to say, 'Do what's important for Australia.' He understood that Japan was now a friend, even though he'd had that history during World War II.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I've got to say that Abe's death is actually a tragedy. It's senseless in so many respects, because of the brutal way he lost his life. It's really so odd, because of the relative lack of political violence in Japan. It's very uncharacteristic of modern Japan. It's also a tragedy in the randomness of the attack on the values and the ideals that he worked for decades to champion, those things that we've discussed in this motion. So, in a sense, it's an attack on all of us, and we need to stand firm on that—all of us who uphold, defend and promote the values that we cherish in our region and across the globe. It's the loss of a husband as well—the loss to his family—and the loss to his nation. I extend my deepest condolences to his partner, who had been his partner for decades, on the loss of a life that had so much more to contribute to affairs of the region. It's a loss for all of us who admired Abe and his leadership. It's a loss for Australia, which has lost a true friend. Vale, Shinzo Abe.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I rise today with a very sad heart following the death of Shinzo Abe. I must say I was absolutely shocked when I heard the news that he had been shot, and I was absolutely shocked and saddened when I heard the news that that shot ended up being fatal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Japanese public: our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers are still with you following that awful, awful incident. I particularly say to the ambassador here in Australia from Japan, my good friend Shingo Yamagami: I offer my sincere condolences to you because, for you, your country has lost not only a great leader and warrior—in the best sense of the word—but also a dear, dear friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is a call to all of us in every democracy that we have to always make sure that we're doing everything we can to safeguard democracy. That means we've also got to be doing everything we can to make sure we safeguard those who are prepared to put themselves forward as representatives of our countries, because, for those who do put themselves forward, if the price is going to be the price that Shinzo Abe paid then that is too great a cost for anyone to bear—for any country to bear, for any family to bear. So we have to make sure we are doing everything we can to protect those who put themselves forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shinzo Abe has left a remarkable legacy, not only for Japan but for the world. It is a legacy that I'm sure the Japanese people will seek to protect and to honour. But it is also one that Australia and all Australians must seek to protect and honour, because he had a vision for the type of region we want to live in, well ahead of its time. He had started to put important architecture in place to ensure that the Indo-Pacific would, as he said, be a region that was free and open—or, as I like to say, peaceful and prosperous. We have to ensure that that architecture that he was putting in place continues to grow so that the vision he had for a free and open Indo-Pacific will continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot's been said about the importance of the Quad in that architecture, and it is critically important architecture. All members of the Quad, particularly Australia, have to ensure that the Quad continues to grow and can continue to deliver on its raison d'etre, which is a free and open Indo-Pacific. Former Prime Minister Abe knew the importance of the Quad and in particular the importance of Japan and India developing, growing and enhancing their relationship. Australia can play its role in making sure that that crucial relationship continues to develop and continues to grow—and we must do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the strategic front, in 2014 former Prime Minister Abe said this in our federal parliament:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In everything we say and do, we must follow the law and never fall back onto force or coercion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was 2014. Sadly, since then we have seen one particular country try to use force and coercion to dictate and determine what type of Indo-Pacific we should live in. Australia, with the strong support of Japan, has strongly fought back against that coercion and has shown the rest of the world that you don't have to be intimidated or cower when coercion is used against you. Now that we've done that and now that we've clearly demonstrated that coercion does not and will not work, we've got to make sure that we continue to put the rules in place and that we send a clear message that coercion will not work into the future. To do that, it's incredibly important that we also recognise what Shinzo Abe had to say, not only on the security side but also on the trade side. That is as important as the Quad in making sure we've got the architecture right in the Indo-Pacific for that free and open, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific that we're all looking for</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was incredibly touching and, I think, incredibly moving for Shinzo Abe that he was able to sign the Australia-Japan FTA with our then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott. It was incredibly important and moving, because his grandfather had signed the initial commerce agreement between Australia and Japan, which really was the first clear demonstration that both countries had, remarkably, in a very short period of time, forgiven and worked out and understood the importance of moving on. That was done under the leadership of the then Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies. Shinzo Abe also quoted Menzies in that speech, who said, 'It is better to hope than always to remember.' Those were incredibly important words at that time, and it really sowed the seeds of the development of a relationship, which I think now is incredibly unique, between countries in the Indo-Pacific, Australia and Japan. All that then led to the commerce agreement, which led to the Japan-Australia FTA, which has been incredibly significant, especially for developing investment between Australia and Japan and important investment by Japanese companies into Australia. I say this very much in a non-partisan way: making sure that no state or territory and no Commonwealth government makes investment decisions without having the decency to consult, especially with Japanese companies, who invest heavily here and provide jobs here, is critically important to the ongoing nature of that investment relationship. But we have to make sure that everything that has come as a result of that commerce agreement, as a result of the FTA, continues, especially when it comes to the Indo-Pacific. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now come to another piece of important architecture that Shinzo Abe identified in 2014, and that was the then TPP. He knew that that was critically important to the ongoing peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Sadly, the United States decided not to proceed with being at the heart of what was then called the TPP, and Japan and Australia, following on from the commerce agreement and from our FTA, then got together and led the way in ensuring that CPTPP could come into force. It is now an incredibly important part of the architecture of the Indo-Pacific. But Shinzo Abe's vision for what that economic architecture might look like would be under threat if we were to make the wrong decisions about CPTPP membership. We have to ensure that anyone who wants to join CPTPP understands the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific and, importantly, understands the rule of law and would never fall back into force or coercion to try and dictate their way in the Indo-Pacific. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what it's like to be on the receiving end of economic coercion, and it has hurt our industries for no good reason. But those industries have stood by the government to make sure that we didn't succumb to that coercion, because they understood how important sovereignty is to our nation. As we progress the CPTPP going forward, we have to make sure that we continue to listen to our key partners, in particular to Japan, as to what form and shape that CPTPP should take and who should be allowed to be a member and who shouldn't. And we both strongly agree that anyone who wants to use economic coercion should not be a member of CPTPP, and that should remain our position as a nation going forward. If not, the legacy that was put in place by Shinzo Abe will start to be eroded, and that is not in the interests of any of us. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shinzo Abe lost his life far too early. He lost his life in the most tragic circumstances far too early. But, like any great leader, he has left a remarkable legacy. As we come together to remember a great life lived, we must all commit to ensuring that that legacy is not lost and that we continue to fight for it, because if we do we will live in the best region in the world, not the most dangerous region in the world.</span>

                  <a href="102376" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MADELEINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I rise to join the Prime Minister and other honourable members in expressing my personal sadness and my deepest sympathies to the people of Japan at the passing, in such tragic circumstances, of Abe Shinzo, the former Prime Minister of Japan. The assassination of Mr Abe was an absolutely shocking event in a country that is very peaceful. I've had the great good fortune to visit Japan for work and on holidays many times. It is an extraordinarily peaceful and friendly country, and to see such violence put upon a former leader was a horrific thing to have witnessed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abe was a catalyst for change in Japan and across the whole region. He was a true friend of Australia who was admired the world over for his leadership and diplomacy. Mr Abe has been a crucial player in the extraordinarily close bilateral relationship between Australia and Japan. Mr Abe visited Australia five times as Prime Minister. He was at the centre of delivering a number of historic agreements that brought our economies closer together, creating decades of resources trade and investment to the advancement and security of both nations. The friendship he offered Australia was immensely consequential. It helped shape, and continues to shape, our region as we understand it today. In no small way he also helped shape Australia's modern economic outlook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abe, when he was Prime Minister of Japan, and the Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott concluded negotiations for the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement in 2014. It was signed in the same year and came into force the year after in this country. The existing economic partnership between our two countries was cemented by this free trade agreement, and it ensured Japan and Australia's ongoing trading and economic relationship. Mr Abe also saw our bilateral relationship elevated to a special strategic partnership in 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abe's four major visits to Australia have impacted our relationship and the relationship between Japan and our resources and energy sector. I was honoured to attend when he came to Darwin in 2018 for the official opening of the INPEX LNG facility, which is one of the world's most significant gas projects. It was driven by over $35 billion worth of investment from Japan. The Ichthys LNG project remains the largest-ever Japanese overseas investment, and Japan chose Australia; Japan chose Darwin. Mr Abe was very much aware of the significance of the Ichthys project for the energy security of his own country, as are we.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same visit, very significantly, Mr Abe attended a ceremony commemorating the 76th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. In that ceremony he and our Prime Minister of the day, Scott Morrison, commemorated the hundreds of people killed in the bombing of Darwin so many years ago, and Mr Abe renewed his vow towards peace at that time. Reflecting on the significance of this moment, Mr Abe said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Thanks to the devoted efforts of many, Japan and Australia have achieved reconciliation and have become special strategic partners driving regional peace and prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very privileged to attend that ceremony in Darwin. As many who were there have observed before, it was indeed very moving and an extraordinary display of how much the relationship between our two countries has changed over so many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same trip he attended the Australia-Japan Summit Meeting. During this visit a memorandum of understanding between CSIRO and the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation was signed to increase cooperation and encourage joint research activities in support of the hydrogen value chain and unconventional resources for energy. This memorandum of understanding is paying off now, as we see continued investment from Japan into hydrogen activities and the development of that industry in Australia—again, like LNG, for our energy security but also, of course, for the energy security of Japan itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very significantly, Mr Abe became the first Japanese prime minister to address both houses of parliament in Canberra. This added a new dimension to the Australia-Japan relationship, which is now a very deep friendship founded on mutual respect, trust and openness. Japan and Australia were the first countries to place the Indo-Pacific over and above their existing foreign policies at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Wannon, I want to acknowledge the work Mr Abe and the diplomatic heft of Japan did in relation to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. Under his leadership, the CPTPP was progressed after the US, sadly, deserted this important multilateral trade agreement spanning the Indo-Pacific. Australia joined Japan in the challenge of reviving the CPTPP under the leadership, in Australia, of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The CPTPP, in its new form after America had left, ultimately came into force in this country in 2018. I want to acknowledge the economic magnitude of Mr Abe's role in ensuring Japan not only played a lead role but took it back up when the TPP was on the floor and nearly abandoned. The significance of the CPTPP cannot be overestimated. It accounts for 11 countries, representing 495 million people—nations with a combined GDP of over $13½ trillion. It is an agreement of vast significance, and I am proud that in opposition Labor supported this through the parliament, as it will be a key driver of economic growth in our region. It is a vital piece of trade and investment architecture for our region which will ensure peace and prosperity for many years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of the extraordinary partnership between Australia and Japan is plain for all to see. Last year, Japan was Australia's second-largest resource export trading partner, with $52 billion in export earnings. LNG exports earned Australia $17.2 billion. There was $12.8 billion derived from exporting coal to Japan, $11.3 billion in iron ore exports and $1.3 billion in aluminium exports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abe's was a life of consequence. He made a difference. He changed things for the better, not just for Japan but for our region and around the world. He was a giant on the world stage, and his legacy was one of global impact and global leadership and a positive one in strengthening the relationship between Japan and Australia. Again, I express my sincere condolences to the people of Japan for the loss of such an exceptional leader as Mr Shinzo Abe. The world is all the worse for his passing. It was made much better by his life. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STE</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">VENS</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  I rise to speak on this condolence motion on the shocking death by assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo. I start by noting that one of his excellent legacies is that we appropriately refer to him as Abe Shinzo rather than, according to the previous Western custom, Shinzo Abe. It was under his prime ministership that Japanese custom changed when it came to referring to their names in the Latin alphabet. It had been the case going back more than a century—I think to the 1870s—that in the Latin alphabet and when interacting with Westerners, whether that be through diplomatic or commercial ties, the Japanese felt it would be easier for us to understand the concoction of their names if they expressed them the way we do. But, of course, it is the case in many East Asian cultures, and it's certainly the case in Japan, that the family name, the surname, is expressed first, and it was Mr Abe's government that made that change. It might not seem significant to us, but it's a very important one within Japanese culture. So I commend the wording of the motion, which appropriately expresses his name as Abe Shinzo, which is the correct Japanese expression of the name.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in a family very significantly influenced by the Second World War and, particularly, our conflict with Japan. My father's father served firstly in North Africa and then in the Pacific as an officer in the Royal Engineers. My mother's mother was a nurse in the Australian Army, and she served at the Heidelberg hospital caring for many returning Australian prisoners of war who had been subjected to enormous horrors through South-East Asia, particularly at the hands of Japanese forces, during the Second World War. Also, my father's uncle—my grandmother's brother—served in Papua New Guinea and received the Military Cross at Gona in the battle soon after the Kokoda Trail campaign in late 1942. It is fair to say that the attitude of that generation towards Japanese people was a very difficult one, and I did grow up in an environment—particularly as I started to engage with Japanese culture and Japanese people—with the shadow of those attitudes. I think many Australians had those shared experiences with that generation. Equally, that generation—particularly Weary Dunlop—was significant in leading a process of making Australians understand the need for us to forgive. It's very important to forgive, even where great evil has occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our relationship with Japan now in 2022 is unbelievable, and it would be unbelievable to some of those who served in the Second World War, when we were engaged against the Imperial Japanese forces. The life of Abe Shinzo has transcended the great maturity and depth of the relationship we now have today with the nation of Japan and the Japanese people. Previous speakers have talked about Abe Shinzo's grandfather and the very significant role he played with Sir Robert Menzies in first establishing economic ties through the commerce agreement between Japan and Australia. That agreement—and the economic trade relationship that we've had with Japan since then—has underpinned an enormous part of Australia's modern prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have come to understand, going way back to the 1950s, how critical the Japanese market has been to us, but in more recent times we've also come to understand the significance of the security relationship. Abe Shinzo was absolutely central to the modern security relationship we have with Japan, to the status and the place that Japan has within the Indo-Pacific region and to many alliances—not just the relationship with Australia but those with many other fellow minded nations in the Indo-Pacific region. Of course, the Quad—the quadrilateral dialogue—is one of the greatest parts of his legacy, where our country, Japan, the United States and India have a process to cooperate on security issues to ensure that we are keeping our region safe and we are living in a free, open Indo-Pacific. I don't think we would have that process if it were not for Abe Shinzo and his leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was also a very significant economic leader within Japan. His approach to economics—Abenomics, as it is colloquially referred to—has made an enormous impact in shaking off what the Japanese people refer to as the 'lost decade' there. Before my career in politics, I spent almost a decade in the wool industry. I travelled to Japan very regularly in that capacity. I was involved in a joint venture with a Japanese company in Malaysia. They were an enormous market—they still are an enormous market—for Australian merino wool and textiles, and they were excellent partners in commerce. That was in the era of Abe Shinzo prior. In the early years of his time as Prime Minister, his impact on trade was very significant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've talked about the TPP and the direct free trade agreement. Free trade is a very fraught topic in any nation. Even in this country, where we have a lot of pride in our embracing of free trade, it's always much more straightforward in principle, but when it gets down to specifics and particular industries et cetera, it can be a challenge. In Japan, even to this day, they have been very deeply scarred from the blockade that was put in place prior to the two nuclear detonations and the peace in 1945, where the Japanese people were, in all respects, starved of key resources. It's been in the culture of Japan in the decades since to be self-sufficient in so many of those products that were denied to them during that blockade. Japanese farmers are no different to Australian farmers, or farmers anywhere on the planet, and they tend to have a lot of political influence and to like a fair bit of protection from their government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The things that Abe Shinzo did in trade, which have presented opportunities for our country, were indeed courageous within his domestic politics. As a South Australian, I can say that Japan is a very significant market for us, as it is for the entire country, not just in resources but obviously in the seafood industry. Many other products from South Australia find a happy export home in Japan, and we're very lucky to have that market and that deep relationship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude by making a point about the tragic circumstances of Abe Shinzo's death by assassination. I think it is something that, for all of us who are representatives in a democratic process, shakes us to the core. Previous speakers have talked about the fact that political assassination is something we hope never to see occur. In Japan in particular, much like in this country, it is something extremely out of the ordinary. Coming on the back of similar incidents in the United Kingdom in recent years, it is a very concerning and surprising development that Abe Shinzo, as a former Prime Minister in Japan who was out campaigning for his democratic briefs in an election, was approached in the street and fatally shot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's something we need to remember as democratic representatives: that we've got to take that risk seriously but also ensure that we don't let it infringe on our democracy. I was with my good friend Senator Simon Birmingham when we heard the news of the shooting. At that stage we heard the fact that he'd been shot, not that he had succumbed to the wounds of that attack. Senator Birmingham had met Prime Minister Abe and been very engaged with his government on trade matters. We were reflecting on the fact that it is particularly shocking when someone you've met has been assassinated in this profession we have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be many members in this House who served in the parliament when Prime Minister Abe gave that very famous address to a joint sitting of parliament and who would have met Prime Minister Abe. It is truly shocking that someone who has the same vocation as us has been shot dead in the street because he's engaged in the same profession that we are. That is something that, unfortunately, we have no choice but to come to terms with. Equally, it's something to be utterly condemned as part of our process of reflecting on his life and his contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that, I thank the Prime Minister and others who have provided the opportunity for us to pay tribute to such a great man, the longest-serving Prime Minister of Japan, who provided unbelievable leadership to his country. Equally important for us as Australians, he transformed our relationship with Japan, our place in the Indo-Pacific and Japan's place in the Indo-Pacific for the better.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">CE</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  I rise to extend my condolences to the family of former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo and to his party, his parliament and the people of Japan. I congratulate the member for Sturt on such a fine condolence speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Prime Minister Abe was a great friend to the people of Australia and a true statesman of Japan and of democracy in our region. Over nearly nine years as Prime Minister and nearly three decades as a member of Parliament, Abe Shinzo was single-minded in his pursuit of a stronger Japan, a more connected Indo-Pacific and a more peaceful world. Under his leadership, the friendship between Japan and Australia flourished, coinciding with the birth of the Quad alliance and the governments of John Howard, Julia Gillard, Kevin Rudd, Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, in 2014, he became the first Japanese Prime Minister to address the Australian parliament, using the occasion to highlight our shared values as two parliamentary democracies and constitutional monarchies, which extend beyond the fences between political parties. That speech that he gave to the Australian parliament really demonstrated the way—a long way—that our relationships have developed since the Second World War. It reminded me of my grandfather who had served in the Royal Australian Navy. He had very strong views, as many people of his generation did, towards the Japanese. I remember, as a young child, we'd sold the family Ford Fairlane and bought a Honda Accord, and I don't think my grandfather talked to my dad for a week afterwards, because he was so angry that we'd swapped from an Australian car to a Japanese car. I guess that was the culture of—I'm sure, being of a similar vintage—our grandparents, who had endured those war years. But fast-forward many decades, and our relationship between Australia and Japan is now, of course, on an extremely solid footing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During his leadership, former Prime Minister Abe steered the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, launched by John Howard and concluded by Malcolm Turnbull. Sixty-five years after former Prime Minister Abe's grandfather concluded the Japan-Australia agreement on commerce with Robert Menzies, Japan remains Australia's third-largest trading partner, second-largest export market and second-largest source of foreign direct investment. This economic relationship, as well as our strong academic, sporting and cultural exchange, is testament to a deep and mature partnership which stands Australians and their businesses in good stead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Abe was also instrumental in realising the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the wake of growing populism on the Left and the Right and in the face of protectionism. His approach to economic leadership in Japan and the global economy was so remarkable that Abenomics has joined Thatcherism and Reaganomics as a well-known political eponym. His three so-called arrows of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms—reflation, spending and growth—have widely been lauded as a stroke of economic genius in the face of global and domestic financial pressures. Prime Minister Abe believed: 'A robust economy is a source of national strength for Japan.' And a stronger Japan is very good news for democracies in the Indo-Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Prime Minister Abe joined the coalition in developing a more comprehensive strategic security partnership in complement to the work of the Quad alliance—cooperating on shared challenges, such as cybersecurity and emerging tech, terrorism and the threat of extremism, COVID-19 and regional health security, and conflict in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. He began to change the way Japan and its Self-Defense Forces engaged in collective security overseas and, in so doing, made clear that Japan would back her allies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He didn't shy away from the mounting global pressures which threatened his pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific. He contended with an increasingly more belligerent China intent on impinging on Japanese territorial sovereignty. Former Prime Minister Abe called out the CCP's—the Chinese Communist Party's—aggression, their deathtrap diplomacy and their record on human rights when many others would not. He defended the rights of Tibetans and Hongkongers to self-determination; he grappled with a malicious dictator in North Korea; he resumed relations with Russia, after centuries of conflict, in the pursuit of a lasting peace; and he acknowledged the role of Japan, as an economic power, in asserting its moral power as well in responding to regional health concerns like Ebola and COVID-19. Prime Minister Abe demonstrated that he was prepared to take the fight to those who would threaten peace and stability in the region and Japan's territorial sovereignty. He also showed that, through strong economic leadership and a single-minded devotion to doing what is right, a leader can transform a nation in the wake of all kinds of trials. Conviction like this is rare in politics in the modern era, but that conviction cost him his job in 2007, in a period when Japan endured a revolving door of politics. And it meant that he saw off his fair share of political, economic and, indeed, health challenges. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a famous Japanese proverb, 'Nana korobi, ya oki,' which means, 'Fall down seven times, get up eight.' Prime Minister Abe put it this way: 'Our predecessors overcame many troubles and much suffering but each time got back up stronger than before.' Prime Minister Abe's story is one of conviction over convenience, of integrity over expedience and of resilience in the wake of grave and nearly insurmountable challenges. He was a thoroughly modern conservative leader who broke through the vested interests and norms that had such deep roots in his party and his country. In his own words, Prime Minister Abe was a patriot. He didn't back down when totalitarian dictators and idealogues challenged him one way or the other. He was a true conviction politician and a true friend and ally of the Australian people. May he rest in peace. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  Archie Roach was a musician and storyteller with the most generous of thought. He managed to have all of us know and think about First Peoples' lives and the hardship which they have endured. He put stories and histories of generations of unfairness and generations of tragedy before each of us so gently that change was possible, so gently that we could all believe that further change is possible. Archie Roach opened up possibilities of reconciliation and possibilities of a fairer Australia. He showed us that songs share stories and that songs and stories can change nations. He let us know what could and should be done—never in a harsh way but in a way that opened up the hearts of all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was born in 1956 in Victoria. Just a few years into his life, he was forcibly removed from his family and taken to life on a mission. Placed in foster care, he was told he was an orphan. Eventually he found a home with Alex and Dulcie Cox, a family of great enthusiasm for music. His foster-father would sing traditional Scottish music. His eldest sister from that family, Mary, taught the basics of guitar and keyboard. Archie said of his foster-father:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He was a big influence on me—a good influence. I'll love him to the day I die.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we all recognise that that influence gave us that amazing sharing of story through song, which gave us the Archie Roach that we are celebrating the life of today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He received a letter when he was about 14 years old telling of the fact that his biological mother had passed. This is when the reality of what happened in Archie Roach's early life struck him. He was enraged. He left his foster home with nothing—no money, no possessions; just a guitar and, understandably, some anger—on his search for his parents and the story of his life. In that search as a teenager, he met Ruby Hunter. They would later marry, form a band and start a life in Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That life gave us the song that has been so celebrated in this place, 'Took the Children Away'. It tells us so painfully, but also with much hope, of the story of the stolen generations and his experience of having been removed from his family. One of the first times he performed that, and one of the largest early audiences he performed that song to, was during the protests of the bicentenary celebrations in 1988. That performance, to a mainly white audience, was at first met with complete silence, which I think shows that silence is not always a sign of disapproval but may be a sign of emotion and people learning afresh. Paul Kelly shares the story:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He finished the song and there was still dead silence … Archie thought he'd bombed, that everybody hated it, so he just turned and started to walk off stage. And as he walked off, this applause started to build and build and build. … people were so stunned at the end of the song that it took them a while just to gather themselves to applaud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is one of the nation's great storytellers, Paul Kelly, telling us about one of our nation's other great storytellers, Archie Roach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1990 he released <span style="font-style:italic;">Charcoal Lane</span>, which featured that song. He was nominated for the ARIA Music Award for Breakthrough Artist in 1991. He won a human rights achievement award. He released nine albums, including collaborations with none other than Bob Dylan, Billy Bragg, Tracy Chapman, Patti Smith and so many more—I couldn't name them all. He was honoured in 2015 on the Queen's Birthday Honours as a Member of the Order of Australia for his services to music and, equally, for his role as a campaigner for social justice. In 2020 he was named Victorian Australian of the Year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While his life was in Victoria, he was loved by Western Australians. He came to Western Australia so many times over the years. He came to open the Perth Festival, he's performed in Broome and at the Nannup Music Festival, and he performed with Paul Kelly at Optus Stadium, just to name a few—always doing more than performing songs, always sharing stories, always sharing insights, and always leaving people with a greater and deeper understanding of the true history of this country, Australia. He was set to perform at the Perth Concert Hall earlier this year in May and, sadly, postponed for health reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I am so fortunate that I got to see Archie, his band and many others perform in 2017 when my dad, Ron Gorman, organised a family outing to the Astor Theatre in my electorate in Mount Lawley. Dad was insistent that we all go as a family to this concert. It was to mark the 20th anniversary of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them </span><span style="font-style:italic;">home rep</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ort</span>, the inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families. We had Sealin Garlett provide a welcome to country. We had footage screened to us of Lang Hancock's statement about 'fixing the Aboriginal problem'—an appalling statement then, as it is now. We had a screening of the apology from Prime Minister Rudd. And we had many stories shared between the audience and Archie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to use a few words from my father, Ron Gorman, who is the person I know who has seen Archie Roach perform more than anyone else, both in Victoria and in the West. Ron Gorman says: 'Being in his presence, you knew that the time with him was special, not just a great gig but a moment of enlightenment'. His legacy lives with all of us as we reach out for his desire to have complex issues known and to have a voice. As an artist and creator, I always thought of Archie as a national treasure. That treasure is now in our hearts and minds.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  Today I rise to pay tribute to one of Australia's most treasured performers, Indigenous musician and song-writer Archie Roach. I just want to acknowledge the lovely tribute from the member opposite, the member for Perth, who saw Archie Roach many times. Colleagues on both sides have spoken about Archie's life and career, a survivor of the stolen generation who battled with both alcoholism and homelessness. Archie's was no easy life. Yet, when he met the love of his life, Ruby Hunter, another child of the stolen generation, he said she changed his life forever. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With Ruby by his side, Archie went on to write music that in turn changed the lives of Australians. Archie attributed his love of music to his foster family, the Coxes. He used to flick through his foster-father Alex's vinyl records. But it was his need for healing that inspired his deepest passion for music. It helped him heal from the trauma of his youth. If Roach's melodies came from a place of suffering, his lyrics gave voice to the thousands of Indigenous Australians who'd been removed from their families as part of the stolen generation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was privileged to witness one of Archie's last performances at Reconciliation Australia's Indigenous Governance Awards in June It was actually the very first event I attended as the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians. I want to thank Reconciliation Australia's CEO, Karen Mundine, for holding that memorable event; and Andrew Meehan both for his work in pulling the event together and for his assistance in reminding me of some of the songs Archie played that night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Archie stepped forward to perform, it was clear he wasn't well. He took a while to start. He was dependent on the oxygen, which had been a feature of his life in recent years. But, when he did start, the room had anticipated the music; they'd anticipated his voice, with his deep soulfulness and raspy voice. The simplicity of his profound lyrics was mesmerising. With a captive audience, Archie performed three songs from his repertoire: 'One Song', 'Small Child', and 'Old Mission Road'. 'Old Mission Road' touched me deep. It's a blues song about losing your parents. Seeing him as sick as he was, singing the song evocative of the pain and loss of a member of the stolen generation, really got to me.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The words would move anyone who had experienced the loss of a parent. If I can take the indulgence of the House, I'd like to take a moment to read the lyrics for the benefit of the House:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  When I heard the news of Uncle Archie Roach's passing on the weekend, my heart broke a little, and I expect that was a feeling shared by many, many thousands of Australians. That's why I'm really honoured to be able to rise in this Australian parliament today to both remember and honour the extraordinary life and legacy of that great songman Archie Roach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He passed away last week aged just 66. That's a young age in Australia these days, but it came after a long illness. I want to acknowledge the lovely tributes from the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians and my colleague the member for Perth, with his great tellings of his family's experiences of going to those concerts in the early days in Perth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Uncle Archie Roach's career spanned almost four decades, so there's a lot to tell if you want to track through each of those different stages of his life. He fell in love with gospel and country music. As a young man, he survived, as we've heard, periods of great trauma, of homelessness and dependency on alcohol. But the trauma of being separated from his family really was such a strong theme and an important part of his project of healing in this nation throughout his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His debut album was an ARIA-award-winning album: <span style="font-style:italic;">Char</span><span style="font-style:italic;">coal Lane</span> back in 1990. The anthemic track on that album is the one we all refer to today: 'Took the Children Away'. That really defined and helped shape Archie's career and introduced him to a very large audience in Australia. He went on to record nine studio albums. He also did a film soundtrack and lots of compilations and live albums as well. His November 2019 album <span style="font-style:italic;">Tell Me Why</span> was his very first to reach the national top 10, and that was a pretty amazing achievement. Those very powerful songs from Archie Roach tell his story of really heartbreaking loss but also love and healing. That was a journey he took through song and music and so generously gave to all of us in this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He shared his life with his life partner and creative soulmate, Ruby Hunter. As the Goanna frontman, Shane Howard, who was a longtime friend of Archie and Ruby, said earlier this week:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's very raw. It's very real. It's a lot to lose, but I think Ruby might be calling him home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Archie was a very proud Gunditjmara and Bundjalung senior elder. He was a musician, an author, a poet, a philosopher, a human rights campaigner and, as we've heard from many of the speeches, a member of the stolen generations. Whilst he was born in Mooroopna, Victoria, Archie was just three years old when he was forcibly removed from his family. He was placed in foster care and, like so many from the stolen generations, was told he was an orphan. He didn't know he still had a family to track down. The member for Perth very eloquently told that story and told of that heartbreak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an editorial in the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Age</span> on Archie's passing which recalled the time at the very beginning of his music career when, in 1989—and he was still pretty much unknown to a mainstream Australian audience then—he was invited to perform live at the Melbourne concert hall by Paul Kelly and the Messengers. This was the concert that the member for Perth just referred to where Archie ended that relatively short set that he was given as a support act on the evening with some pretty heart-wrenching recollections of his experiences of the Stolen Generations. He led with that song 'Took the Children Away', which includes the words:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Taught them that and taught them this</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And others taught them prejudice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">You took the children away</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Paul Kelly, that other great Australian storyteller, would later recall, the audience sat there stunned:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He finished the song and there was still dead silence ... Archie thought he'd bombed, that everybody hated it, so he just turned and started to walk off-stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And as he walked off, this applause started to build and build and build. It was this incredible reaction. I'd never seen it before—people were so stunned at the end of the song that it took them a while just to gather themselves to applaud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach toured the world, headlining and opening shows for some of the great storytellers and songwriters: Joan Armatrading, Bob Dylan, Billy Bragg, Tracy Chapman, Suzanne Vega and my much-loved Patti Smith. That would have been my dream come true, to see Patti Smith and Uncle Archie Roach perform together. I've seen them both separately, but that is something I missed, and I deeply regret that. But certainly the legacy Archie Roach has left us is immense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember some of my very early education in challenging the stories I might have been told about my nation when I was growing up as a young child during schooling in Newcastle and Bermagui. It was songs from musicians and bands like No Fixed Address and Warumpi Band—my introduction to early Indigenous contemporary music—that really made me think about the stories of nationhood. It was those songs, and then songs of people like Uncle Archie Roach that came later, that really alerted me to an unsettled business in this nation. They were stories about land rights, sovereignty, kinship, trauma—and ultimately healing. They were great, great gifts to our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach's strength and courage in sharing his own story was crucial to establishing really great initiatives like having a stolen generations redress scheme. He never gave up on seeking justice. His generous gift of song and music to this nation is one that so many Australians have now taken to heart. Archie Roach changed lives. He's helped change our nation, and for that we shall always be forever indebted. He showed us the power of music, not just as a healing agent but also as a tool to seek justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time, I'm really thinking of his two sons, Amos and Eban. I send my heartfelt condolences to them and to all the family during this sorry time. Please take some comfort in knowing that there are thousands of Australians mourning with you today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise to join parliamentary colleagues from all sides of the House to pay tribute to the extraordinary life of the late Archie Roach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The arts offer a way to tell stories, to share and process experiences, to reflect pain and to send a message of hope. Archie Roach used his music to do all this and more. Aboriginal people, of course, have an extraordinary artistic and cultural tradition. It is a culture which goes back over 60,000 years and has a central place for dance, for music, for painting, for storytelling and for many other artistic forms. There are many outstanding contemporary Aboriginal musicians, and Archie Roach stands out amidst that remarkable company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really no surprise that, while all Australians feel immense pride in this extraordinary country in which we live, the inheritors of that 65,000 years of culture have a particular gift for stunning and insightful portraits of our nation and the lives we lead within it. So, as shadow arts minister, I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to the remarkable contribution and life of Archie Roach. As we've heard, he was a multi-award-winning Australian musician, a campaigner for the rights of Indigenous Australians. He was just three years old when he was removed from his family. After several foster homes, he settled with Alex and Dulcie Cox, where he was surrounded by music, which ignited his passion. He became a clear and strong voice of the stolen generation. Both he and his wife, Ruby Hunter, were survivors, and the songs they wrote together became a soundtrack for Indigenous Australians. He first became known for the song 'Took the Children Away', which featured on his debut solo album, <span style="font-style:italic;">Charcoal </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Lane</span>, in 1990. This single won an international human rights achievement award—the first time one was ever awarded for a song—and the album was certified 'gold' and won two ARIA awards. <span style="font-style:italic;">Charcoal Lane</span> featured in the top 50 albums from 1992 of <span style="font-style:italic;">Rolling Stone</span> magazine. He and Ruby Hunter co-founded the Black Arm Band, a collection of Aboriginal artists. He recorded 10 studio albums, two live albums, one soundtrack album and four compilation albums, including the soundtrack for <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Tracker</span>, and has won five ARIA awards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his later years in particular, Archie Roach collected a rich array of awards recognising the remarkable contribution he had made as an Australian, as an Aboriginal man and as a musician. In 2011 he was one of the first people inducted into the Victorian Aboriginal Honour Roll. In 2015 he was honoured in the Queen's Birthday honours list as a member of the Order of Australia for services to music as a singer-songwriter, a guitarist and an activist for social justice. In 2020 he was named the 2020 Victorian Australian of the Year. Amongst the other nominations and awards he received was a Deadly award for a lifetime contribution to healing the stolen generations, in 2013. At the 2020 ARIA music awards, held on 25 November 2020, Archie Roach was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach contributed in a range of ways going beyond his extraordinary musical contribution. The establishment of the Archie Roach Foundation was intended to nurture meaningful and potentially life-changing opportunities for First Nations artists. Archie Roach wrote this in the statement for the foundation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Foundation is a way for me to give back and pass on what's been given to me from people I've met on my journey who have pointed me in a different direction to a better way of life and understanding, to freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from being a musician and author, Archie worked in a range of jobs throughout his life and brought to bear that very diverse experience in his music. At different times he worked as a drug and alcohol counsellor, worked floral arranging, salt shovelling, blacksmithing and in an abattoir and even spent a short period as a tent boxer. He's collaborated with a long list of great musicians and artists, including Paul Simon, Bangarra Dance Theatre, Paul Kelly, David Bridie, Jimmy Barnes, Paul Grabowsky and the Australian Art Orchestra, and he's toured extensively throughout the US, Canada, the UK and Europe with artists of the stature of Bob Dylan, Billy Bragg, Tracy Chapman, Suzanne Vega, Patti Smith and Joan Armatrading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his 2019 memoir, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Tell Me Why: The Story </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f My Life </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nd My Music</span>, Archie Roach told Australians about many aspects of his life in a very raw and authentic way. His memoir was awarded the Victorian Premier's literary award in February 2021. In his acceptance speech, he had this to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We need to understand and write about the First People's experience and history as well [as migrants' experiences] because they're both connected, they're intertwined.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is a powerful insight. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach enjoyed tremendous success in his artistic career, but throughout his times of great success he never forgot the challenges he'd experienced at different times of his life. He was known for his humility, for his sense of generosity, and even as his health deteriorated he continued to perform, particularly for Aboriginal audiences. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A distinctive feature of Archie Roach's approach was that, despite the traumas that he'd experienced, he lived his life with hope, and that informed his approach as a storyteller and as a truth-teller. He had this to say: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You can reach the darkest point in your life and come back, and come good, even better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So using his art, using his music, he told stories of very difficult times for him and others, but also sent a message of hope. As he once said, 'Songs outlive people,' and his body of work, the songs that he wrote, the songs that he performed, is a profound legacy that he leaves to all Australians, together with the inspiration of the way he carried out his life and work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join with other members of this House in expressing deep condolences to Archie's family and friends, particularly his sons, Amos and Eban, and foster children, Kriss, Arthur and Terrence. I close by joining with many other members in acknowledging the extraordinary life and contribution of Archie Roach, in recognising his remarkable talent and in thanking him for the truth-telling and the message of hope that he sent to Indigenous Australians and that he sent to all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  This morning, in preparation for this speech, I read the lyrics of 'Took the Children Away'. It's a song I know well—as I know that most people in this place and around our country know well—but, as I started reading it this morning, of course I started crying. Such is the power of Archie Roach's work, that a song so well known, so often played and heard, still moves me to tears, and I know I would not be alone in that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach was a powerful storyteller and musician. He told his story, and in doing so he also told our country parts of its story that we too often wanted to ignore. He did this with beauty, with dignity and with vulnerability. He invited all of us to share not just the sorrow and the horror but also the strength and the opportunity of that story. To be able to put together that life—which included a lot of pain and suffering being inflicted upon him—with the opportunity to also see the strength, dignity and opportunity for change is such a remarkable combination and achievement. It takes a remarkable man to be able to use that trauma as the starting point for strength, outreach and, ultimately, change. Coming back to where I began, the last words of 'Took the Children Away' are: 'The children came back. Yes, I came back.' They are words of hope, words of strength, words of a potential future—a way forward for our country from the hurt and from the trauma. They speak also to the importance for Archie Roach of his community, of his country, of his people and of coming back to those people and to that country. Archie Roach was a proud Gunditjmara and Bundjalung man, and I extend my deepest sympathies to all of his family and his community mourning his passing. Please know that our country grieves with you and that we feel privileged that we were also able to share his story, to hear his music and also, through him, to be moved to work for change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of seeing Archie Roach perform a number of times, including performances with his great love, Ruby Hunter. And every single one of those performances was a special occasion. You always knew that when Archie had his guitar, when he was on a stage, that something beautiful was about to come, that something moving was about to come and that something powerful was about to come. One of the reasons I was privileged enough to see Archie Roach perform so many times is because his and Ruby's story was also very much a Victorian and a Melbourne story. So much of it was set around Fitzroy and, as the title of Archie's album makes clear, Charcoal Lane. He wrote about the places where his life happened. He wrote about his country, but he also wrote about the Melbourne streets where his story played out. And I also know from many of the tributes that have been paid to him, that him telling that story about what his life was like on those Melbourne streets has helped many a young First Nations person in Melbourne and Victoria to understand where their strength lies and to understand what a better future can look like for them. That is a remarkable legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach's impact on Australian music is clear from the many tributes he has received from our musicians. From Paul Kelly, who he performed with, to more recent musicians such as Briggs, who in his tribute rightly said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Being the greatest means you transcended the genre, and what you do impacts culture. You change culture around the world. You change the discussion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what Archie Roach did. He changed culture and he changed lives. It is a remarkable gift and a remarkable legacy. Thank you Archie Roach, for sharing your story, your gift and your life with us. We will all miss you, but we are so grateful for having had you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  I never had the honour of meeting Archie Roach—musician, storyteller and a voice for Indigenous people. However, Archie Roach grew up and spent a significant part of his young life in Casey, and today I want to pay tribute to Archie, and share more of his story in Casey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2020 after 30 years on the Australian music scene. He had a profound impact on our country that goes well beyond the power of his music. As a member of the stolen generations, Roach put his deeply personal stories to music, and became an advocate for Indigenous Australians—giving a voice to others who had experienced the same pain of being removed from family and country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gunditjmara-Bundjalung senior elder was born in Mooroopna, near Shepparton in Victoria, but was removed from his family when he was three. He experienced several years of unstable foster conditions until being settled with his foster parents, Alex and Dulcie Cox, a family of Scottish immigrants living in Mount Evelyn and later in Mooroolbark in my electorate of Casey. His foster sister, Mary Cox, would sing church hymns and taught Archie guitar and piano. Archie's love of music was inspired by Alex's collection of Scottish music.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie once said about his foster father:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He was a big influence on me—a good influence. I'll love him to the day I die.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an interview with our local paper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Star </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Mail</span>, last May in the lead-up to the tour for his memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tell Me Why</span>, Roach spoke of his early years growing up in Casey. He spent holidays in his foster family's shack in the gum forests of Mount Evelyn, a beautiful and inspiring place. He later lived in Mooroolbark and attended Lilydale High School, a place of which he had fond memories. He said that he had great friends at Lilydale High, friends he really cared about. I like to think about him finding joy in the same place I spent many happy times in childhood. The environment is beautiful, as are the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1970, while in class at Lilydale High, Roach received a letter from his sister, Myrtle, informing him that his biological mother, Nellie, had died. It was this letter that sent him on a journey to find the truth about his origins and life as an Aboriginal man, leading to some of his most poignant and well-known songs, such as 'Took the Children Away'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach will be remembered for his unwavering desire to share the stories of Aboriginal people, his iconic voice and his musical capabilities. Roach was meant to perform in Healesville this weekend. His music will live on in the many communities he made better, including ours in Casey. I would like to share, as everyone has, my condolences to his family and friends—in particular his sons, Amos and Eban.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Assistant Minister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  Vale Archie Roach. Australia and the music world have lost a legend, and I want to extend my deepest sympathies to Archie's family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archibald William Roach AM showed that music matters to who we are as a nation and that songs are about the stories that we tell ourselves and to others across the land—deeply personal stories of how they took the children away, of how two-year-old Archie was forcibly taken from his mum, dad and family at the Framlingham Aboriginal mission in south-west Victoria. They are songs that speak of a bitter truth but also celebrate the enduring love and the sweetness of a family reunion. It's a song of the stolen generations but also a story of our nation. When the song was performed for the first time amidst the protests at the bicentenary celebrations in 1988, his performance, to a mainly white audience, was first met with stunned silence. But the applause that followed and the acclaim that grew throughout Archie's musical career showed the transformative power of art. For all that was taken from Archie and so many others, it was the gift of his songs that we are so grateful for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He will be remembered as one of the early Aboriginal artists to bring First Nations music into the mainstream. He really did set the pace and inspire others, like Yothu Yindi and other great First Nations artists, to sing their songs of their heritage and their culture. His mentoring and nurturing of the next generation of storytellers is also part of his great legacy and his gift to this nation. It showed how revered Archie was by contemporary artists, and how relevant his message is today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If anyone had cause to be bitter or angry with the card that life had dealt them, it was Archie Roach. But he never lived his life with that anger, with that bitterness, with that regret. His life and his songs were a message of forgiveness, of compassion, of love, but, more importantly, of the power of looking ahead to a brighter future while telling the truth of the darkness of the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie's death is a huge loss for our nation, and his songs will live on forever. And those truths that he spoke of will always be part of the Australian story. Rest in peace, Archie Roach.</span>
